Some SSGs, like Jekyll, Hugo, and Eleventy, have strong opinions about how to organize the content in your repo.
CloudCannon can run automatic processes on these SSGs and provide basic editing out of the box.
Nuxt takes a less opinionated approach and allows you to decide where and how content is stored.
This means that for Nuxt sites, CloudCannon out of the box only has the source editor available.

#### Interlude: Editing terminology

CloudCannon has a few concepts that make organizing data easier:

* **Data**\: These are standalone data files. This is ideal for site configuration or files that don't need to repeat. Data is edited by altering a single file.
* **Collections**\: A folder of files that represent a repeatable data format. This is a good fit for pages, blogs, staff members, recipes, etc. Collections are edited by altering any file or adding more files.

Using the [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) module makes integrating your Nuxt site with CloudCannon easy.
This module has clear anologues to the organization of data mentioned above.
Most importabtly, it requires that you separate your site content from the templating and rendering logic.
This makes it easiest to integrate the site into the CMS.

When using the Nuxt Content module, we recommend grouping related content in directories.
For instance, if your site has a blog with multiple posts, it's a good idea to keep those posts in a `posts/` folder.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  CloudCannon does not support Server-side Rendering as our build and hosting environments are decoupled.
</comp.Notice>

CloudCannon supports a set of file formats for files in Data or Collections:

* Structured data files: JSON, YAML, TOML, CSV, TSV
* Markup files: HTML, Markdown
* Combination files: HTML with front matter, Markdown with front matter

Front matter refers to a section at the top of a markup file that contains structured data. CloudCannon supports JSON, YAML and TOML front matter. Markdown comes in many flavours, so be sure to checkout configuring your Markdown engine.

*<u><strong>If you need another supported format, please contact support and we would be happy to look into it.</strong></u>*

### Updating Nuxt to use file data

Now that we have the terminology it’s time to organize our content.
For Document-driven sites, in your Nuxt page component(s) you can fetch your page data like so:

<comp.CodeBlock language="javascript" source="pages/[...slug].vue">
```
  const { page } = useContent();
```
</comp.CodeBlock>
This catch-all route will fetch the relevant file in your `content/` directory, based on the URL you have navigated to.
For example, navigating to `/about/` will fetch the `content/about.md`, if it exists.

If you are not using Document-driven mode, you can instead fetch your page data using the [queryContent composable](https://content.nuxtjs.org/api/composables/query-content), like so:

<comp.CodeBlock language="javascript" source="pages/about.vue">
```
	const page = await queryContent().where({ _path: '/about' }).findOne();
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

For more usage examples, we recommend taking a look at our [Sendit Nuxt template](https://github.com/CloudCannon/sendit-nuxtjs-template).

### Tell CloudCannon about the data

To configure the CloudCannon interface, you will need to tell CloudCannon how our your site is structured.
For this we use [CloudCannon reader](https://github.com/CloudCannon/reader), an open-source NPM library used to integrate editing.
You don't need to install this package, as CloudCannon will run it automatically as part of your build processes.

Reader looks for a [CloudCannon config file](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/setting-global-configuration/) in the root of your site.
You can configure almost all of the editing interfaces in CloudCannon using this file.

Check out the [reader documentation](https://github.com/CloudCannon/reader) and define your collections.
Once you have pushed your changes to CloudCannon your site will rebuild.
After building, any changes to the interface that you configured in your CloudCannon config file will take effect.
You will be able to:

* Add, remove, edit and rename any collection item
* Edit any data file
* Configure the look and feel of the CloudCannon Editors

#### The CloudCannon Editors
CloudCannon has four different options for editing your site files:

* **Source Editor**: Edit your code directly within CloudCannon in a familiar-looking text editor.
* **Data Editor**: Edit your data and front matter in a recursive form full of customizable inputs.
  * Add, remove, clone, rearrange and edit arrays
  * Open objects and edit content to any depth
  * Change data with date, color, number, URL, and more inputs
* **Content Editor**: A big WYSIWYG editor for your markdown content with an embedded Data Editor on the side. This is perfect for files that have a combination of markdown and front matter.
* **Visual Editor**: A combination editor with your live site on one side and the Data Editor on the other side. The rest of this tutorial will focus on linking these two side-by-side editors.
