    ## Visual Editor Previews

    In a previous section of this guide, we talked about the Visual Editor â€” an intuitive way to edit your site by clicking directly on a preview of your page. But how do you make each region editable in the Visual Editor?

    The [Vue Connector](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/live-editing-with-vue/) is our open-source tool which listens for live editing events in the Visual Editor. CloudCannon will re-render your page as changes occur, generating a preview of your page as you edit.

    ### The Vue Connector

    There are a few requirements for data previews in the Visual Editor:

    * Components must have an output URL. If your site is built using the Nuxt Content module, components in the `pages/` directory are a good example.
    * Components must get their data from a data/content file somewhere in your project. This is critical, as the Visual Editor cannot open the components themselves.
    * These data/content files must be configured as a CloudCannon Collection. See the [CloudCannon Reader documentation](https://github.com/CloudCannon/reader#readme) for more information.
    * Components will need to use the Vue `onMounted` and `onBeforeUnmount` hooks.

    CloudCannon Vue Connector is available on npm. To install it, run the following terminal command:

    <comp.CodeBlock language="" source="">
    ```
    npm i -D @cloudcannon/visual-editor-connector
    ```
    </comp.CodeBlock>

    Add the following code to any component that you wish to add live editing to:

    <comp.CodeBlock language="" source="">
    ```
    <script setup>
      import { onMounted, onBeforeUnmount, ref } from 'vue';
      import { onCloudCannonChanges, stopCloudCannonChanges } from '@cloudcannon/visual-editor-connector';

      const { page } = useContent();

      const pageData = ref(page.value);

      onMounted(async () => {
        onCloudCannonChanges((latestValue) => {
          pageData.value = latestValue;
        });
      });

      onBeforeUnmount(async () => {
        stopCloudCannonChanges();
      });
    </script>
    ```
    </comp.CodeBlock>
