Welcome to the CloudCannon Nuxt starter guide! If you want to get your Nuxt Site editable, built, and live on CloudCannon, you are in the right place.

Before we start, this guide assumes you already have a Nuxt site uploaded to a Git repository. Although you can <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/create-a-site-with-direct-upload/">upload files directly</a> from your hard drive, we highly recommend using a Git repository.

Don’t have a Nuxt site yet? No worries! You can create one with our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/tutorials/">Jamstack tutorials for your favorite SSGs</a>.

With Nuxt, you can use CloudCannon’s Source Editor out-of-the-box. We’ll teach you how to configure our other editing interfaces: the Visual, Content, and Data Editors.

In this guide we’ll cover how to create your first site, update Nuxt to use file data, and configure Nuxt for the best CloudCannon experience.
