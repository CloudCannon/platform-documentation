[Hugo modules](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/) allow you to use themes and components from other repositories in your site.
In some cases, you will need to customize your CloudCannon setup to enable or improve the way these modules interact with your site.

For sites with Hugo Modules that are public GitHub repositories, no action will be required for your site to build successfully.
However, if you own the repository in question, emulating Hugo Modules using CloudCannon's Site Mounting will provide some benefits
by triggering builds on your website when your module changes.

For sites with Hugo Modules in private GitHub repositories, one of the two approaches in this guide will be required.

If your module setup is simple, representing a theme module of layouts of components, emulating Hugo Modules using CloudCannon's Site Mounting
is a good option. This leverages CloudCannon's existing authenticated connection with your git provider, and provides automatic builds
for your site when your module repository is changed.

If your setup is more complicated, for example your module has its own modules, setting up a matching structure using Site Mounting presents is less trivial.
In this case, we recommend using GitHub's access tokens to provide your site with the required permissions for downloading your modules.
