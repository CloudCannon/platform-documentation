    For sites built with Jekyll, CloudCannon automatically finds likely collections and adds them to your sidebar. This could include a folder of blog posts. CloudCannon will also configure two collections called Pages and Data.

    The Pages view lists the pages on your site. Clicking on a page will open it in one of the editing interfaces based on the file extension.

    The Data tab shows all your data files. Clicking on a page will open it in one of the editing interfaces based on the file extension.
