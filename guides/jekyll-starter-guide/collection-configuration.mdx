    ## CloudCannon Plugin

    To integrate your site’s collections into the CloudCannon app, we run the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/cloudcannon-jekyll">CloudCannon Jekyll plugin</a>. **You don’t need to install this package, as CloudCannon will run it automatically as part of your build processes.**

    The plugin will scan your global configuration file to find pages, collections, and data files. The reader will write this information to the hidden file `_cloudcannon/info.json`. When you navigate to a collection from your sidebar, the preview of each file and other elements in the CloudCannon app interface are generated using this JSON file.
  </comp.SlotContent><comp.SlotContent name="SSG_Configuration_Paragraph">
    CloudCannon provides basic content editing for Jekyll without any configuration. However, we recommend you use a global configuration file to get the most out of the platform. CloudCannon gives you complete control to fine-tune the editing experience for you and your team members.
