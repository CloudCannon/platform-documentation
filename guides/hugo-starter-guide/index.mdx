Welcome to the CloudCannon Hugo starter guide! If you want to get your Hugo site built, editable, and live on CloudCannon, you are in the right place.

Before we start, this guide assumes you already have a Hugo site uploaded to a Git repository. Although you can <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/add-files-with-direct-upload/">upload files directly</a> from your hard drive, we highly recommend using a Git repository.

Donâ€™t have a Hugo site yet? No worries! You can create one with our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/tutorials/">Jamstack tutorials for your favorite SSGs</a>.
