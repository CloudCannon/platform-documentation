    ## Snippets

    CloudCannon supports embedding rich Snippets in Markdown files when using the Content Editor. Snippets appear as blocks in your rich text view, and once configured, the Snippets icon in your WYSIWYG toolbar will provide a modal menu for your content team to select from.

    We’ve talked about Snippets earlier in the guide, but now is your opportunity to set up custom Snippets! To get started, read our <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/snippets-using-hugo-shortcodes/#custom-hugo-shortcodes">Custom Hugo Shortcodes guide</a> or <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/support/">reach out to our support team</a>.

    ## Bookshop

    A common feature of modern website builders is the ability to add and move content blocks to build custom page layouts from defined components. We’ve created <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop">Bookshop</a> to automate maintaining page components for page building. Bookshop is an open-source component library compatible with Astro, Eleventy, Hugo, Jekyll, and SvelteKit. It’s simple to introduce and has tight integration into CloudCannon, which will handle most of the setup.

    To get started with Bookshop, read our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop/">Bookshop guide</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/support/">reach out to our support team</a>.
