You can give your team access to update the website by sharing it with
them. There are multiple types and levels of sharing:

* [**Team Members**](/documentation/articles/managing-your-team-members/)
— Have access to all the sites on your account. Owners have full
permissions, Developers can do everything except manage billing, Technical
Editors can’t create new sites, and Editors don’t have access to the code
editors.
* [**Collaborators**](/documentation/articles/sharing-on-a-per-site-basis/)
— Lets you share an individual site. You can Site Share to Technical
Editors or Editors.
* [**Client Sharing**](/documentation/articles/giving-clients-access-to-update-a-site/)
— Is a way to share a site to someone without them needing a CloudCannon
account. Instead, they enter a pre-defined password to gain editing
access.
* [**SSO/SAML**](/documentation/articles/using-sso-to-create-team-accounts/)
— CloudCannon also supports authenticating through SSO on our enterprise
plan.

## Projects

As a Git-based CMS, you can set up branching/staging workflows, PRs, and
branch merges. All of this is possible with
[Projects](/documentation/articles/enabling-editor-branching-with-projects/).
Once you have a site set up you can create a Project. Editors have a button
to create a copy of the site on a new branch; there they can make changes
without impacting the main branch. When they’re ready to publish, they can 
hit the publish button and it will do a branch merge or PR behind the scenes.
