    ## CloudCannon Plugin

    If you're reading your build logs in CloudCannon, you'll see a build step that runs `@cloudcannon/cloudcannon-hugo` after your SSG. 

    CloudCannon Reader is the tool that scans your global configuration file and processes your collections. This tool runs automatically, so there isn't anything you need to do.

    If you want to look under the hood or customize your config further, Reader is open-source on GitHub at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/cloudcannon-hugo">CloudCannon Hugo plugin</a>.

    CloudCannon provides basic content editing for Hugo without any configuration. However, we recommend you use a global configuration file to get the most out of the platform. CloudCannon gives you complete control to fine-tune the editing experience for you and your team members.
