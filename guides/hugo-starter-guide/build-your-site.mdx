              **Common Hugo Build Errors**

              If you built your site using the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">Hugo Quick Start guide</a>, you will have installed the Ananke theme for Hugo as a git submodule. CloudCannon doesn't support submodules by default, but you can clone the submodule repository using CloudCannon's build hooks.

              To fix this build error, create a .cloudcannon/preinstall file in the root directory of your repository, with this line of code:

            <comp.CodeBlock language="bash" source=".cloudcannon/preinstall">
            ```
            git clone https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
            ```
            </comp.CodeBlock>

    ## CloudCannon Plugin

    If you're reading your build logs in CloudCannon, you'll see a build step that runs `@cloudcannon/cloudcannon-hugo` after your SSG.

    The CloudCannon Hugo Plugin is a tool that scans your global configuration file and processes your collections. This tool runs automatically, so there isn't anything you need to do.

    We'll cover the CloudCannon Configuration file in a later step of this guide. If you want to look under the hood or customize your setup further, this plugin is open-source on GitHub at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/cloudcannon-hugo">CloudCannon Hugo plugin</a>.
