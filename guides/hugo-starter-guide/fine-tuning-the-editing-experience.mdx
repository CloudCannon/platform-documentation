CloudCannon provides basic content editing without any configuration. To
get the most out of the platform, you have full control to fine-tune the
editing experience. CloudCannon configuration typically lives in a [global
config
file](/documentation/articles/setting-global-configuration/) but can also be [set at a
variety of
scopes](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/).

Let's set up the global config file. Create `cloudcannon.config.yml` in
the source directory (probably the root unless you have a custom setup) of
your website. We'll use this file throughout the rest of this tutorial.

There are four main ways to structure content on a Hugo site, let’s walk
through how they work on CloudCannon:

## Markdown

Content sourced from Markdown will editable in the Visual Editor by
default as long as it’s wrapped in an HTML element. For example, this
would be editable in the Visual Editor:


<comp.CodeBlock language="html">
```
<div class="content">
  {{ content }}
</div>
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

This would not:

<comp.CodeBlock language="html">
```
<div class="content">
  {{ content }}
  <p>I'm not an only child</p>
</div>
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Read more about this in the [Editing Markdown files in Visual Editor
docs](/documentation/articles/editing-markdown-files-in-the-visual-editor/).

You can also edit Markdown content on CloudCannon with the Content Editor,
and in the front matter with the Data Editor.

The two things you may want to configure for Markdown content is your
[Markdown engine](/documentation/articles/configuring-your-markdown-engine/), 
and the [WYSIWYG toolbar](/documentation/articles/defining-editable-regions-in-your-html/#options)
in both the Visual and Content Editor.

Let's go over an example of how you would customize the
toolbar. Say we want to give our content team the ability to add a table
to Markdown files. In our global config file we have full control over all
the editing WYSIWYG toolbar.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json", "javascript"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
```
_editables:
  content:
    bold: true
    italic: true
    bulletedlist: true
    numberedlist: true
    image: true
    table: true
    undo: true
    redo: true
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

This example scratches the surface of how you can configure the WYSIWYG
toolbar. [Check out the docs for a full list of
options](/documentation/articles/defining-editable-regions-in-your-html/#options).

## HTML

HTML lives in layouts on a Hugo site. You can add a class of `editable` to
most HTML element to make it editable in the Visual Editor. For example:


<comp.CodeBlock language="html" source="layouts/home.html">
```
<p class="editable">I'm editable in the visual editor</p>
<p>I'm <strong>not</strong> editable in the visual editior</p>
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Give as much or as little access to your content team as they need. Just
note, changes to the HTML save back to the layout which might be used by
multiple content files.

The element you apply the `editable` class to will change what editing
options are available in the WYSIWYG toolbar. For example, add the
`editable` class to an `<h1>` and you’ll get basic text formatting
options. Add it to a `<div>` and you’ll also be able to add images, lists,
and tables. You can even [customize the WYSIWYG
toolbar](/documentation/articles/defining-editable-regions-in-your-html/#options) to have complete control over
what editors can and cannot add to each element.

HTML content can only be updated in the Visual Editor.

## Front Matter
Content in front matter is automatically available in the sidebar in both
the Visual Editor and Content Editor, as well as on its own in the Data
Editor. You can customize every property to provide the best editing
interface for your content team.

CloudCannon has naming conventions that do not require any further
configuration. For example, if you end a front matter field with `_image`,
like `background_image`, CloudCannon will display a image upload/selector.
There's a number of these conventions you can learn more about in 
the [Customizing your inputs
documentation](/documentation/articles/how-to-choose-what-input-is-used-in-the-data-editor/).

You can also explicitly configure a front matter field too. For example,
let's say you had the following front matter:

<comp.CodeBlock language="html" source="index.html">
```
---
background: "#ff0000"
hero_content: "Everything you need"
sidebar: 
---
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

And we wanted editors to have the following inputs for each one:

* **background** - color picker
* **hero_content** - WYSIWYG markdown editor
* **sidebar** - checkbox

We could add the following to the global configuration file:


<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json", "javascript"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
```
_inputs:
  background:
    type: color
  hero_content:
    type: markdown
  sidebar:
    type: checkbox
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>
Here’s some of the input types available:

* [Text Area](/documentation/articles/using-text-inputs-to-edit-your-data/#textarea)
* [Code block](/documentation/articles/using-code-inputs-to-edit-your-data/)
* [Color Picker](/documentation/articles/using-color-inputs-to-edit-your-data/)
* [Checkbox](/documentation/articles/using-checkbox-inputs-to-edit-your-data/#checkbox)
* [Date](/documentation/articles/using-date-and-time-inputs-to-edit-your-data/)
* [Image](/documentation/articles/using-upload-inputs-to-edit-your-data/#image)

On top of configuring the type of input, you can configure how it displays
and behaves in CloudCannon:

* Comment — Add a description to help your editors understand how to use this field.
* Instance Value — Initialize a field with a unique UUID or today’s date.
* Hidden — Hide a field you don’t want your content team to change.
* Label — The label for the input.

Let's add some of these fields to the input configuration we defined
previously:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json", "javascript"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
```
_inputs:
  background:
    type: color
    comment: "Defines the background for the entire page"
  hero_content:
    type: markdown
    label: "Hero text"
  sidebar:
    type: checkbox
    hidden: true
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

If you want to update front matter content in the Visual Editor rather
than the sidebar, you can set up [Visual Data
binding](/documentation/articles/what-are-visual-data-bindings/),
which is a small snippet of HTML in your layout to tell CloudCannon which
front matter property populates the HTML element. For example,

<comp.CodeBlock language="html" source="index.html">
```
<h1 data-cms-bind="#title">Main Heading</h1>
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

will open an overlay to edit the title property in front matter.

## Page Building

A popular and powerful way to empower content editors is to provide them
with a set of building blocks or page components and let them add, remove,
reorder, and update these components to build their own pages.

CloudCannon
[Structures](/documentation/articles/defining-what-adds-to-an-array-with-array-structures/) support a set of predefined
objects. For example, you might have a structure that allows editors to
add photo galleries, testimonials, image and text blocks, and CTAs. It
makes them a perfect fit for creating your own page builder. You define
the content structures you want for editors, and they can add, remove,
reorder, and update them from the array.

When you pair
[Structures](/documentation/articles/defining-what-adds-to-an-array-with-array-structures/) with [visual data
binding](/documentation/articles/what-are-visual-data-bindings/) and [visual data
previews](/documentation/articles/using-live-editing-with-vanilla-js/), you have a powerful page
builder which behaves in a similar way to Squarespace. This is extremely
powerful but can take some configuration to set up, so we’ve created
[Bookshop](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop) to automate this process. It’s an open-source
component library for Hugo and other SSGs. It’s simple to set up and has
tight integration into CloudCannon, which will handle the majority of the
setup.

To get started with Bookshop, take a look at the [Hugo starter
guide](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop/blob/main/guides/hugo.adoc) or a full tutorial on
converting [Bootstrap to Hugo +
Bookshop](https://cloudcannon.com/community/learn/bootstrap-to-a-client-editable-hugo-site/).

## Data files
Data files are automatically available to update in the [Data
Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-data-editor/). The same [inputs
configuration](/documentation/articles/how-to-choose-what-input-is-used-in-the-data-editor/)
you used for front matter will work on data files too.
