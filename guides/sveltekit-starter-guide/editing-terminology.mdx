    Some SSGs, like Jekyll, Hugo, Astro, and Eleventy, have strong opinions about how to organize the content in your repository. CloudCannon can run automatic processes on these SSGs and provide basic editing out-of-the-box. SvelteKit takes a less opinionated approach and allows you to decide where and how content is stored. This means that for SvelteKit, CloudCannon’s out-of-the-box options only include the source editor.

    CloudCannon has a few concepts that make organizing data easier:

    ## Turn SvelteKit into an SSG

    To get the most out of CloudCannon, you will need to [run SvelteKit as a Static Site Generator](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-static). You can do this by using SvelteKit's `adapter-static` adapter.

    First, install the adapter by running `npm install -D @sveltejs/adapter-static` in your terminal.

    Then, in your `svelte.config.js`, import the static adapter and set it as the `adapter` in the `kit` config object like so:

    <comp.CodeBlock language="Javascript" source="">
    ```
    import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-static';

    const config = {
      kit: {
        adapter: adapter(),
        // additional 'kit' config
      },
      // additional svelte config
    }
    ```
    </comp.CodeBlock>

    You may need to convert your `+page.js` and/or `+layout.js` files to `+page.server.js` and `+layout.server.js` files, respectively.

    ## Updating SvelteKit to use file data

    It’s time to organize our content.

    To get the most out of CloudCannon, it's best to make sure your content is separate from your templating and routing logic. We recommend storing your page content in files using one of the file formats listed above. Markdown with front matter is a great choice for storing content because the front matter can be easily edited in the Data Editor and the Markdown content Content Editor.

    We recommend one content file per page, organized within a `content/` folder.

    With your content nicely organized, you'll then need to fetch this data into your page components. CloudCannon has an open-source package called [Filer](https://github.com/cloudcannon/filer), which lets you easily pull data from your content files and collections.

    For example, in a `+page.server.js` (or equivalent) you could fetch your `content/about.md` file data like so:

    <comp.CodeBlock language="Javascript" source="">
    ```
    import Filer from '@cloudcannon/filer';

    export async function load() {
      const filer = new Filer({
        path: 'content'
      });

      const data = await filer.getItem('about.md', {});
      return data;
    }
    ```
    </comp.CodeBlock>

    <comp.Notice info_type="info">
      If your `load` function loads variable pages (e.g. using the `slug` param) it's a good idea to wrap the `getItem` call within a `try...catch` block.
