SvelteKit is a JavaScript web-app framework focused on fast development, build speeds and page loads.
SvelteKit sites are built with Svelte, a powerful component framework with a large and adoring fan-base.
Svelte compiles your components at build time, which means Svelte components are lightweight and load extremely quickly in the browser.
This also makes SvelteKit a great choice for building high-performance static sites.

{/* CloudCannon is the perfect CMS for SvelteKit static sites. You can fully control the editing experience and live-edit */}
CloudCannon makes it easy to store your content in your Git Repository and have non-developers update it.
Thereâ€™s no need to teach people about front matter, markdown or Git.
