    ## Visual Editor Previews

    In a previous section of this guide, we talked about the Visual Editor â€” an intuitive way to edit your site by clicking directly on a preview of your page. But how do you make each region editable in the Visual Editor?

    ### Svelte Connector

    The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/svelte-connector">Svelte Connector</a> is our open-source tool which listens for live editing events in the Visual Editor. CloudCannon will re-render your page as changes occur, generating a preview of your page as you edit.

    There are a few requirements for data previews in the Visual Editor:

    * Components must have an output URL. SvelteKit routes are a good example.
    * Components must get their data from a data/content file somewhere in your project. This is critical, as the Visual Editor cannot open the components themselves.
    * These data/content files must be configured as a CloudCannon Collection. See the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/reader#readme">CloudCannon Reader documentation</a> for more information.
    * Components will need to use the Svelte `onDestroy` and `onMount` functions.

    CloudCannon Svelte Connector is available on npm. To install it, run the following terminal command:

    <comp.CodeBlock language="" source="">
    ```
    npm i @cloudcannon/svelte-connector
    ```
    </comp.CodeBlock>

    Add the following code to any component that you want to add live editing to:

    <comp.CodeBlock language="JavaScript" source="">
    ```
    <script>
      import { onDestroy, onMount } from 'svelte';
      import { onCloudCannonChanges, stopCloudCannonChanges } from '@cloudcannon/svelte-connector';

      // pageDetails is passed from parent, or via SvelteKit load function
      export let pageDetails;

      onMount(async () => {
        onCloudCannonChanges((newProps) => pageDetails = newProps);
      });

      onDestroy(async () => {
        stopCloudCannonChanges();
      });
    </script>
    ```
    </comp.CodeBlock>

    In the above code, `pageDetails` is an object that contains data for the markup portion of the component.

    After loading the content file in the Visual Editor, changing the data in the sidebar will push the new props to `pageDetails`. This will display the new values in the Visual Editor immediately.
