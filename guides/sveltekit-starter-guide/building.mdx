The second step for any new site is to get a successful build. This also mirrors your local development environment. On CloudCannon, select SvelteKit as your SSG.

The **Command Line Options** section is where most of the important things to configure are:

* Any required environment variables
* Install Command: Command to install dependencies before build. This is run as a line of bash and can be anything you want. By default this runs `npm install`. A common change here is to use `yarn install` instead.
* Build Command: Command to build your site. This is similar to the install command. By default this runs `npm run build`. Make sure your build command runs all necessary build steps, such as `vite build`.
* Output Path: Path to the output folder you are building into. This is important because CloudCannon needs to know which folder to treat as the static output of your site. By default SvelteKit builds into the `build` folder.

Ideally your build will work the first time. If this is the case, you can move to the next step.

#### First-build problems
If your build did not work the first time, be sure to read the build output — this will let you know what didn't work.
CloudCannnon will read the output of your failed build and will provide suggested fixes for common problems.
Check the *Status* page to see the Build Suggestions for your site.

You may find you need extra commands to complete your build. A common example is using postcss; for this you can use build hooks, adding specially named bash scripts that run at different steps in the build. For more information, see [the build hook documentation](/documentation/articles/extending-your-build-process-with-hooks/).

### Interlude: Your site is built

Once your site is built, you will see a big green tick on the screen. At this point, your site’s files are synced and a successful build has been run.

It is a helpful step at this point to check that the site looks correct. CloudCannon will host your built site on a free testing domain.
This domain will be styled *[adjective-noun.cloudvent.net](http://adjective-noun.cloudvent.net)*.
You can see this preview site by clicking the **Live site preview** button in the top left corner of the screen, under the **Save** button.

If your site built correctly and your preview looks good, you can move on to editor configuration.
If you need to update your build, click the **Settings** button at the bottom left of the screen, then navigate to *Builds* / *Configuration*.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Your new *[adjective-noun.cloudvent.net](http://adjective-noun.cloudvent.net)* site will give you a preview after every change. Use this to show off your new site.
</comp.Notice>
