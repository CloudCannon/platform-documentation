  Learn how to configure your Collection details, including file name, icon,
  documentation link, and description.
---
When you first created your Site on CLoudCannon, you added your Collections to the *Site Navigation*. Whether you chose to use CloudCannon's detected Collections or customize a Collection manually, each Collection currently has a key, path, name, and icon.

Let's go over how to update those configuration details, including a few extras like adding a description and documentation link.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  You can't edit the `key` for a Collection using *Configuration Mode*. If you need to change the Collection `key`, please open the CloudCannon Configuration File in the Source Editor or use your local development environment.
</comp.Notice>

Open the *Collection Browser* of the Collection you want to configure and turn on *Configuration Mode* using the switch on the right of your *Site Header*. Purple *Edit configuration* buttons will appear, and several existing UI elements will be highlighted in purple.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Configuration-Mode-On" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows several UI elements highlighted in Configuration Mode purple." title="The Collection Browser" type="screenshot"/>
