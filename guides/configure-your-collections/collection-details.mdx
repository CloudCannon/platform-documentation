  Learn how to configure your Collection details, including file name, icon,
  documentation link, and description.
---
When you first created your Site on CLoudCannon, you added your Collections to the *Site Navigation*. Whether you chose to use CloudCannon's detected Collections or customize a Collection manually, each Collection currently has a path and icon.

Let's go over how to update those configuration details, including a few extras like adding a display name, description, and documentation link.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  You can't edit the `key` for a Collection using *Configuration Mode*. If you need to change the Collection `key`, please open the CloudCannon Configuration File in the Source Editor or use your local development environment.
</comp.Notice>

Open the *Collection Browser* of the Collection you want to configure and turn on *Configuration Mode* using the switch on the right of your *Site Header*. Purple *Edit configuration* buttons will appear, and several existing UI elements will be highlighted in purple.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Configuration-Mode-On" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows several UI elements highlighted in Configuration Mode purple." title="The Collection Browser" type="screenshot"/>

When you are happy with your configuration, don't forget to save your changes to the `cloudcannon.config.yml` file using the *Save* button in your *Site Header*.

## Path

The Collection path defines where CloudCannon should look for your Collection files. The path must be unique and relative to the Source of your Site (e.g., if your Collection files are in `/website/blog` and your Source is defined as `/website`, the Collection path would be `/blog`).

Updating your Collection path can affect what files are visible in CloudCannon. As files can only belong to one Collection at a time, CloudCannon will display files in the Collection with the most specific path (e.g., files stored in `/blog/authors` will appear in the Collection with the path `/authors` instead of the Collection with the path `/blog`). Please ensure the CloudCannon is displaying the correct files when you update a Collection path.

Click on the *Edit Advanced* button in the top right of your *Collection Browser*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

The first configuration option in the *Edit Advanced* data panel is *Path*. Type in the *Path* text field to change the path for a Collection. CloudCannon will update the *Collection Browser* as you type to show which files will belong to a Collection with that path.

## Display Name and Icon

The display name and icon for your Collection determine what appears in the *Site Navigation*. The display name also appears at the top of the *Collection Browser* and the icon on each *File Card*. We recommend using a name and icon that provides context about what kind of files are in a Collection, to help your team members find their way around the Site.

If you opted to use CloudCannon's detected Collections when you created your Site, the Collection name will be the Collection key in title case by default (i.e., `travel_blog` becomes "Travel Blog"). A display name will override this default in the *Site Navigation* and *Collection Browser*. By default, the Collection icon will be the one with the closest name to your Collection key from [Google's Material Symbols and Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Symbols&amp;icon.style=Rounded) library.

If you manually added your own Collections, you may have already entered a display name and icon.

To change the display name and icon for a Collection, click on the *Edit Name and Icon* button next to the Collection name in your *Collection Browser*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

The first configuration option in the *Edit Name and Icon* data panel is *Display name*. Type in the *Display name* text field to change the name of a Collection.

The second option is *Icon*. Select an icon from [Google's Material Symbols and Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Symbols&amp;icon.style=Rounded) library. You can type in the select text field to filter your options.

CloudCannon will update the *Site Navigation*, *Collection Browser*, and *File Cards* as you type.
