Your Collections are where you store your files. They're easy to find: clicking on the link in the *Site Navigation* will open the *Collection Browser*

Along with CloudCannon's editing interfaces, Collections are where the content creators in your team are going to spend the majority of their time. You can configure several aspects of a Collection for a more customized experience. Each of these is optional, so you can choose what seems right for your team.

You can configure each Collection individually, with your preferences for each Collection stored under the `collections_config` key in your CloudCannon Configuration File. In the [Add your Collections](/documentation/guides/getting-started/add-your-collections/) step of this guide, we added simple configuration for each Collection: a key, path, name, and icon.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````

collections_config:
  news:
    path: /blog/news/
    name: Company News
    icon: breaking_news

``````````
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

Let's add more configuration to each Collection by opening a *Collection Browser* and turning on *Configuration Mode*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Configuration-Mode-On" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows several UI elements highlighted in Configuration Mode purple." title="The Collection Browser" type="screenshot"/>

In this step of the guide, we'll show you how to configure:

* The way your file Cards look in the *Collection Browser*.
* The way CloudCannon adds new files to your Collection.
* Which editing interfaces are allowed for files in your Collection.
* The default way your *Collection Browser* sorts your files.
* The appearance of your *Collection Browser*, including the name, icon, description, and documentation link.

## File Card appearance in the *Collection Browser*

In the [Add your Collections](/documentation/guides/getting-started/add-your-collections/) step of this guide, we introduce you to the *Collection Browser*. The purpose of the *Collection Browser* is to enable you to view, sort, and find the files in your Collection. The easier it is to do this, the more efficient you and your content team will be.

Your files occupy the majority of the UI in each *Collection Browser*. Every file is represented by a Card: a square UI element that previews information about a file. You can configure several parts of the file Card, including the text, subtext, image, icon, and metadata. You can also configure the file view in your *Collection Browser*, between *Gallery*, *Card*, and *List*.

Between the Card previews and *Collection Browser* view, you can create several different appearances for your files in CloudCannon.

### *Collection Browser* view

Let's start with configuring the view for your Collection.

The *Change view menu* is one of the controls in your *Collection Browser*, which allows you to switch between three view options: *List*, *Cards*, and *Gallery*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls-View-Dropdown" alt="A screenshot of the Change view menu in the Collection Browser shows a dropdown with several options for Collection file appearance." title="The Change view menu" type="ui-snippet"/>

You can configure the default view for each Collection and which view options are available in the *Change view menu* for your team members to use. These preferences are stored in your CloudCannon Configuration File under the `view` and `view_options` keys for each Collection.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">

collections_config:
  blog:
    path: 'blog'
    icon: 'post_add'
    view: 'gallery'
    view_options:
      - 'list'
      - 'card'
      - 'gallery'

``````````
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

The default view defines which view CloudCannon uses when someone opens the *Collection Browser* for the first time. If you use the *Change view menu* to select a different view, CloudCannon will remember your preference and use that instead of the default the next time you open the *Collection Browser*.
