The purpose of the *Collection Browser* is to enable you to view, sort, and find the files in your Collection. By making the files in your *Collection Browser* easier to identify, you and your team will be more efficient at managing your content.

We can configure the appearance for each file Card, as well as the view and sorting options for the *Collection Browser*. Between these options, you can create several different appearances for your files in CloudCannon.

## What are file Cards?

Your files occupy the majority of the UI in each *Collection Browser*. Every file is represented by a Card, a square user interface element that previews information about a file.

You can configure the text, subtext, image, icon, metadata, and icon for each Card. Depending on which view you are using for your Collection, only some of these might be visible.

The *List* view is...

The *Card* view is...

<comp.DocsImage path="" alt="" title=""/>

The *Gallery* view is...

## Configure the *Collection Browser* view

Let's start with configuring the view for your Collection. Open a *Collection Browser* and turn on *Configuration Mode* using the switch on the right of your *Site Header*.

The *Change view menu* is one of the controls in your *Collection Browser*, which allows you to switch between three view options: *List*, *Cards*, and *Gallery*.

You can configure the default view for each Collection and which view options are available in the *Change view menu* for your team members to use. By default, both of these configuration options are unset, meaning the default view for a Collection will be *Card* or *Gallery*, depending on the contents of your file, and all view options are available in the *Change view menu*.

Click on the *Change view menu* with *Configuration Mode* on, and select the purple *Edit this menu* option from the dropdown. CloudCannon will open the *Edit view* data panel.

Under the *View* section, you can select one view as the default for your *Collection Browser*. This is the view CloudCannon will use when team members first open the Collection. If you or a team member uses the *Change view menu* to select a different view from the available options, CloudCannon will remember your preference and use that instead of the default the next time you open the *Collection Browser*.

Under the *View Options* section, you can select one or more views for the *Change view menu* options. You can use this to limit what views a team member can use in a particular Collection.

Let's go through two examples.

If you want to limit your Collection to a single view...

If someone's view preference is no longer available in the options...

These preferences are stored in your CloudCannon Configuration File under the `view` and `view_options` keys for each Collection.

        - text:
            key: 'parent_keys'
          icon: 'escalator_warning'

</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

## File sorting

The *Change sorting menu* is one of the controls in your *Collection Browser*, which allows you select which method CloudCannon uses to sort your Collection files. By default, the *Change sorting menu* has the following options:

* Path (ascending and descending)
* File size (ascending and descending)
* Created at (ascending and descending)
* Last modified (ascending and descending)
