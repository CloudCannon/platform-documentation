  Learn how to configure your Card previews, view, and sorting for a Collection
  on CloudCannon.
---
The purpose of the *Collection Browser* is to enable you to view, sort, and find the files in your Collection. By making the files in your *Collection Browser* easier to identify, you and your team will be more efficient at managing your content.

We can configure the appearance for each file Card, as well as the view and sorting options for the *Collection Browser*. Between these options, you can create several different appearances for your files in CloudCannon.

Open the *Collection Browser* of the Collection you want to configure and turn on *Configuration Mode* using the switch on the right of your *Site Header*. Purple *Edit configuration* buttons will appear, and several existing UI elements will be highlighted in purple.

When you are happy with your configuration, don't forget to save your changes to the `cloudcannon.config.yml` file using the *Save* button in your *Site Header*.

## What are *File Cards*?

Your files occupy the majority of the UI in each *Collection Browser*. Every file is represented by a Card, a rectangular user interface element that previews information about a file. These are called *File Cards*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows three File Cards in the Gallery view with preview screenshots." title="The Collection Browser" type="screenshot"/>

You can configure the text, subtext, image, icon, metadata, and icon for the *File Cards* in each Collection to change what information is displayed in the *Collection Browser*. By default, each *File Card* has an icon inherited from the Collection icon, text matching the name of the file in title case, the output URL for a file (if you have a successful Site build), and a *Context Menu* button on the top right.

In the *Card* view, *File Cards* are wide and rectangular. To keep this option vertically compact, you can only display a limited amount of metadata in the List view.

In the *Card* view, *File Cards* are more square, with several files visible in the same "row" of the *Collection Browser*.  If you configure metadata for your *File Cards*, the Card will grow vertically to accommodate the data.

In the *Gallery* view, *File Cards* are rectangular. Like the *Card*, each Card will grow vertically to accommodate any metadata. The main benefit of *Gallery* view is the gallery section at the top. If you have a successful Site build, the gallery section can display a preview screenshot of the webpage that the file outputs to. The preview screenshot will update to the most recent version of your webpage each time you rebuild your Site, helping you visually identify each file. You can also display a static image or an icon in the gallery section.

The *Gallery* view is the default view in unconfigured Collections.

## Configure the *Collection Browser* view

The *Change view menu* is one of the controls in your *Collection Browser*, which allows you to switch between three view options: *List*, *Cards*, and *Gallery*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls-View-Dropdown" alt="A screenshot of the Change view menu in the Collection Browser shows a dropdown with several options for Collection file appearance." title="The Change view menu" type="ui-snippet"/>

You can configure the default view for each Collection and which view options are available in the *Change view menu* for your team members to use. By default, this configuration option is not set, meaning the default view for a Collection will be *Card* or *Gallery*, depending on the contents of your file, and all view options are available in the *Change view menu*.

Click on the *Change view menu* with *Configuration Mode* on, and select the purple *Edit this menu* option from the dropdown. CloudCannon will open the *Edit view* data panel.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls-View-Dropdown-Config-Mode" alt="A screenshot of the Change view menu with Configuration Mode on shows an option called Edit this menu in the dropdown." title="The Change view menu" type="ui-snippet"/>

The *View options* array on the *Edit view* data panel allows you to select and order the three view options: *List*, *Card*, and *Gallery*. Any options you include in the *View options* array will be available in the *Change view menu*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="Configure-Collections-Edit-View-Data-Panel" alt="" title=""/>

&nbsp;

The first option you define in the *View options* array is the default view for your *Collection Browser*. If you or a team member uses the *Change view menu* to select a different view from the available options, CloudCannon will remember your preference and use that instead of the default the next time you open the *Collection Browser*.

Select and order the view options in the *View options* array.

CloudCannon will add your configuration preferences to `cloudcannon.config.yml` under the `view_options` key. Here's an example of what this configuration might look like:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````

collections_config:
  news:
    view_options:
      - gallery
      - list

``````````
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

CloudCannon will add your configuration preferences to `cloudcannon.config.yml` under the `view_options` key. Here's an example of what this configuration might look like:

CloudCannon will add your configuration preferences to `cloudcannon.config.yml` using the `text`, and `icon` keys under the `documentation` object. Here's an example of what this configuration might look like:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````

collections_config:
  keys:
    path: '_keys'
    icon: 'key'
    preview:
      text:
        key: 'key_name'
      subtext:
        key: 'key_name'
      metadata:
        - text:
            key: 'key_value_type'
          icon: 'data_object'
        - text:
            key: 'parent_keys'
          icon: 'escalator_warning'

``````````
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

## Sorting files in the *Collection Browser*

The *Change sorting menu* is one of the controls in your *Collection Browser*, which allows you select which method CloudCannon uses to sort your Collection files. By default, the *Change sorting menu* has the following options:

* *Path* (ascending and descending)
* *File size* (ascending and descending)
* *Created at* (ascending and descending)
* *Last modified* (ascending and descending)

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls-Sort-Dropdown" alt="A screenshot of the Change sorting menu in the Collection Browser shows a dropdown with several options for sorting Collection files." title="The Change sorting menu" type="ui-snippet"/>

You can configure the default sorting method for each Collection, add custom sorting options, and choose which sorting options are available in the *Change sorting menu* for you team members to use. By default, this configuration option is not set, meaning the default sorting method for a Collection will be *Path (ascending)*, and the *Path*, *File Size*, *Created at*, and *Last modified* sorting options are available in the *Change sorting menu*.

Click on the *Change sorting menu* with *Configuration Mode* on, and select the purple *Edit this menu* option from the dropdown. CloudCannon will open the *Edit sorting* data panel.
