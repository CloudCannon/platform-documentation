To get the most out of the staging/production workflow, you'll want to configure your "production" branch thoughtfully.

## Prevent direct editing

In this workflow, your production branch only be edited by merging from another branch. 

If the production branch is edited directly, this could cause merge conflicts which can be difficult for non-technical team members to debug and fix.

To prevent editing of your site in CloudCannon, click navigate to your site dashboard, then click "Settings". In the *Details* section, check **Editing Locked** and click the **Update Site** button.

You might also want to set up protections on the branch from your Git provider. This will prevent developers on your team from committing directly to the branch.

Read more about the options available from your provider in the links below:

* [Managing protected branches in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches)
* [Using branch permissions in Bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/using-branch-permissions-776639807.html)
* [Protected branches in GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/protected_branches.html)

## Make this site user facing

The "production" branch is what you show to your end-users. You might do this by [adding a custom domain in CloudCannon](http://localhost:9010/documentation/articles/hosting-your-site-on-a-custom-domain/) or [outputting the built files to another Git branch to be hosted elsewhere](http://localhost:9010/documentation/articles/output-a-built-site-from-cloudcannon-to-an-external-provider/).

In either case, you have ensured that your live site can only be altered by merging changes from another branch, adhering to any protections you might have configured.

In the next step, we'll look at setting up a staging site where you can make these changes, preview your work, and publish to the production environment through CloudCannon.
