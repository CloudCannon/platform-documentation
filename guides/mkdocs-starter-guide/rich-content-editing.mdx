When writing content with MkDocs you have access to a wide range of Markdown extensions to
enable you to build rich, interactive pages. With CloudCannon Snippets you can integrate your
Markdown extensions directly in the Content Editor. This means you get clean and intuitive Markdown
editing with the power of being able to create and edit structured components â€” all without
touching the underlying code.
