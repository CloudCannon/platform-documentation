    * Any required environment variables.
    * Install Command: Configure the command to install dependencies before the build. By default, this runs `npm install`. This is run as a line of bash and can be anything you want. A common change here is to use `yarn install` instead.
    * Build Command: Configure the command to build your site. By default, this runs `mkdocs build`.
    * Output Path: Configure the path to the output folder you are building into. CloudCannon needs to know which folder to treat as the static output of your site. By default, MkDocs builds into the `site` folder.

    ## CloudCannon Reader

    If you're reading your build logs in CloudCannon, you'll see a build step that runs `@cloudcannon/reader` after your SSG. 

    CloudCannon Reader is the tool that scans your global configuration file and processes your collections. This tool runs automatically, so there isn't anything you need to do.

    If you want to look under the hood or customize your config further, Reader is open-source on GitHub at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/reader">CloudCannon/reader</a>.
