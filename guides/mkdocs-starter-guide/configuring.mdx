Some SSGs, like Jekyll, Hugo, and Eleventy, have strong opinions about how to organize the content in your repo.
CloudCannon can run automatic processes on these SSGs and provide basic editing out of the box.
While MkDocs does require that all your content is located within a specific folder, how you organize that content
is up to you. This means that for MkDocs, CloudCannon out of the box only has the source editor available.

### Editing terminology

CloudCannon has a few concepts that make organizing data easier:

- **Data**\: These are standalone data files. This is ideal for site configuration or files that don't need to repeat. Data is edited by altering to a single file.
- **Collections**\: A folder of files that represent a repeatable data format. This is a good fit for pages, blogs, staff members, recipes, etc. Collections are edited by altering any file or adding more files.

CloudCannon supports a set of file formats for files in Data or Collections:

- Structured data files: JSON, YAML, TOML, CSV, TSV
- Markup files: HTML, Markdown
- Combination files: HTML with front matter, Markdown with front matter

Front matter refers to a section at the top of a markup file that contains structured data. CloudCannon supports JSON, YAML and TOML front matter. Markdown comes in many flavours, so be sure to checkout configuring your Markdown engine.

### Tell CloudCannon about the data

To configure the CloudCannon interface, you will need to tell CloudCannon how your site is structured.
For this we use [CloudCannon reader](https://github.com/CloudCannon/reader), an open-source NPM library used to integrate editing.
You don't need to install this package, as CloudCannon will run it automatically as part of your build processes.

Reader looks for a CloudCannon config file in the root of your site.
You can configure almost all of the editing interfaces in CloudCannon using this file.

Check out the [reader documentation](https://github.com/CloudCannon/reader) and define your collections.
Once you have pushed your changes to CloudCannon your site will rebuild.
After building, any changes to the interface that you configured in your config file will take effect.
You will be able to:

- Add, remove, edit and rename any collection item
- Edit any data file

You will have numerous editing options available to you:

- Source Editor: edit your code directly within CloudCannon in a familiar-looking editor.
- Data Editor: Edit your data and front matter in a recursive form full of customizable inputs.
  - Add, remove, clone, rearrange and edit arrays
  - Open objects and edit content to any depth
  - Change data with date, color, number, URL, and more inputs
- Content Editor: Edit your markdown files and data at the same time. A big content block for your Markdown and an embedded data editor on the side. This is perfect for a combination of Markdown and front matter files.
- Visual Editor: A combination editor with your live site on one side and the data editor on the other side. The rest of this tutorial will focus on integrating the two sides more.

### Configuring CloudCannon

With your collections configured in CloudCannon, you can focus on polishing the experience for your editors.
A good place to start is expanding on your collection configuration. This allows you to do things like:

1. Change the icons, names, descriptions, and documentation links in the collections interface.
2. Define which editors can be used to edit each collection item.
3. Manage the order of collections in the sidebar and how they are grouped (e.g. Blogging &gt; Posts).
4. And, Show and hide collections entirely.

The global configuration file is one of many places that configuration can exist. Some options can exist only in the global config. Others options can be configured in a number of places; these options always start with an `_` character.
These options cascade like CSS: the more specific the options are, the more they take precedence. From least important to most important, the order is:

1. Global configuration.
2. Collection configuration.
3. Front matter.
4. Containing structure.

### Configuring inputs

A common option to be configured in the cascade is `_inputs`. This option allows you to change what input is used for which keys. This can be anything from a text input, color pickers, select fields, date pickers and more. By default, CloudCannon uses the format of your data and keys to decide on the input to use. It is best to review each collection and adjust these as needed.

Another great cascade option is `_structures` which allows you to control how new array and object items are added. Arrays are a great way to create page builders or a configurable navigation. The next section will discuss a system for generating structures automatically.
