    ### Snippets

    CloudCannon supports embedding rich Snippets in Markdown files when using the Content Editor. Snippets appear as blocks in your rich text view, and once configured, the Snippets icon in your WYSIWYG toolbar will provide a modal menu for your content team to select from.

    Weâ€™ve talked about Snippets earlier in the guide, but now is your opportunity to set up custom Snippets! To get started, read our <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/snippets-using-python-markdown/#custom-snippets">Custom Python Markdown Extensions guide</a> or <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/support/">reach out to our support team</a>.
