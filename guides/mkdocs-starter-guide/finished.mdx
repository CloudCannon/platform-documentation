That’s it for the base MkDocs setup.
Read through our docs on [global configuration](/documentation/articles/setting-global-configuration/) for some ideas of how you might further configure CloudCannon for your site.

Once you are happy with the experience as a developer, you can share it with your team or clients.
If you have an internal team, see [team sharing](/documentation/articles/managing-your-team-members/).
If you have a client, see [client sharing](/documentation/articles/giving-clients-access-to-update-a-site/).
If you need more information, check out our [SSO/SAML support](/documentation/articles/using-sso-to-create-team-accounts/).

If you experience any issues with your MkDocs build, don’t hesitate to [contact our support team](/support/).
