MkDocs is a Python SSG geared towards documentation sites with a focus on speed and simplicity.
MkDocs sites are written in Markdown and have access to a stack of great themes.
Your Markdown files are compiled to static HTML at build time with no required JavaScript meaning
that MkDocs sites load extremely quickly and can be hosted anywhere on the internet.

CloudCannon makes it easy to store your content in your Git repository and have non-developers update it.
Thereâ€™s no need to teach people about front matter, Markdown or Git.
