With components on the page, Bookshop will create CloudCannon's
[Visual Data Bindings](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/what-are-visual-data-bindings/) automatically
if it can find the data for that component in your page's front matter.

You can customize this behavior by including a flag in the component's data. Bookshop will look for any of the following keys:

- `data_binding`
- `dataBinding`
- `_data_binding`
- `_dataBinding`

Astro templates can also use the `bookshop:binding` directive to disable data bindings at build time.

For example:

<comp.CodeBlock language="astro" source="page.astro">
```
<Item props={props}/> //1
<Item props={props} bookshop:binding={false}/> //2
```
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  By default, a component will be given a data binding if possible.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="2">
  This component will **not** be given a data binding.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  This flag only applies to the tagged component and doesn't cascade 
  down. Any subcomponents will follow the standard rules or may also 
  specify their own Data Binding flag.
</comp.Notice>
