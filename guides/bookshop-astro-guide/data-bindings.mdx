With components on the page, Bookshop will create CloudCannon's
[Visual Data Bindings](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/what-are-visual-data-bindings/) automatically
if the data for that component can be found in your page's front matter.

By default, Bookshop will add bindings for any components 
on the page, but will not add bindings for shared helper files. This 
prevents Bookshop from rendering data bindings around our shared page helper,
so that the components within are immediately accessible.

This behavior can be customized by including a flag in the component's data. Bookshop will look for any of the following keys:

- `data_binding`
- `dataBinding`
- `_data_binding`
- `_dataBinding`

For example:

<comp.CodeBlock language="liquid" source="page.liquid">
```
<!-- Components -->
{% bookshop 'item' props: props %} <!--1-->
{% bookshop 'item' data_binding: false props: props %} <!--2-->

<!-- Includes -->
{% bookshop_include 'page' props: props %} <!--3-->
{% bookshop_include 'page' data_binding: true props: props %} <!--4-->
```
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  By default, a component will be given a data binding if possible.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="2">
  This component will **not** be given a data binding.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="3">
  By default, bookshop_include helpers will not be given a data binding.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="4">
  This helper **will** be given a data binding.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  This flag only applies to the tagged component directly and doesn't cascade 
  down. Any subcomponents will follow the standard rules, or may also 
  specify their own Data Binding flag.
</comp.Notice>
