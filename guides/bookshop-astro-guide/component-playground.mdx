The Bookshop component playground allows you to browse and 
experiment with your components. When running in development, the 
component playground also provides hot reloading of component templating 
and styles.

After getting your Bookshop dependencies installed,
run the following command in the root of your repository:

<comp.CodeBlock language="bash" source="Command line">
```
npx @bookshop/browser #1
```
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  Add the `--help` flag to see all available options.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>

By default, this will discover any Bookshop directories in or under the current working directory,
and will host a component library on port 30775.

After running this command, a component playground will be viewable on [http://localhost:30775](http://localhost:30775/)

## Specifying preview data for your components

The `blueprint` of your component specification represents the initial state of your component
when you add it to a page in CloudCannon. However, when previewing a component locally, we usually
want to see the component as it would appear in a realistic setting.

You can do this by using the `preview` key of your component specification to provide the data that Bookshop should use in the playground.

The component `preview` is deep merged with the component `blueprint` so, given the following specification:

<comp.CodeBlock language="yaml" source="hero.bookshop.yml">
```
blueprint:
  hero_text: "Hello World"
  cta:
    button_text: ""
    button_url: "#"

preview:
  cta:
    button_text: "Click me"
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Your component preview data will be:
<comp.CodeBlock language="yaml" source="Playground Preview">
```
hero_text: "Hello World"
cta:
  button_text: "Click me"
  button_url: "#"
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

As a result, your `preview` key doesn't need to mirror the entire component structure,
and can instead cherry-pick the relevant keys to override for the preview.
