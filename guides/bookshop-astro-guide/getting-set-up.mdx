Building a site with Bookshop requires a specific directory structure that lives alongside your website,
and an Astro integration to discover and use components.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
   As a useful reference, the [Astro Sendit Template](https://github.com/CloudCannon/sendit-astro-template) repository 
   contains an example site fully integrated with visual editing. Browsing the code and the file structure
   of this template can be helpful to solidify the concepts covered in this guide.
</comp.Notice>

## Prerequisites

Bookshop requires Node >= 16 to be installed on your machine.

## Creating your Bookshop directory

Bookshop requires that your component files live in a specific directory structure, which allows for components
to be discovered automatically. 

The easiest way to get started is to create a `bookshop` folder containing a `bookshop.config.cjs` in your site
`src` folder, alongside the existing Astro `components` directory. This way Bookshop can automatically discover
components from the `components` directory.

With this in mind, the basic directory structure for an Astro Bookshop site will look like:

<comp.Tree>
```
public/
src/
>> bookshop/
>  >> bookshop.config.cjs
>> components/
>> layouts/
>> pages/
astro.config.mjs
```
</comp.Tree>

Inside your `bookshop.config.cjs` add the following content:

<comp.CodeBlock language="javascript" source="bookshop.config.cjs">
```
// Standard bookshop configuration
module.exports = {
  engines: {
    "@bookshop/astro-engine": {}
  }
}
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

This file houses the configuration for your Bookshop project,
in this case instructing Bookshop to use the `@bookshop/astro-engine` package for any live component rendering.

## Connecting Bookshop to Astro

To connect Bookshop and Astro, install the `@bookshop/astro-bookshop` integration from npm:

<comp.Tabs label="Package Managers">
 <comp.Tab name="npm">
    <comp.CodeBlock language="bash" source="Command line">
    ```
    npm i --save-exact @bookshop/astro-bookshop
    ```
    </comp.CodeBlock>
 </comp.Tab>
 <comp.Tab name="Yarn">
    <comp.CodeBlock language="bash" source="Command line">
    ```
    yarn add --exact @bookshop/astro-bookshop
    ```
    </comp.CodeBlock>
 </comp.Tab>
</comp.Tabs>

Within your Astro config, import this integration and add it to your Astro config.

<comp.CodeBlock language="astro" source="astro.config.mjs">
```
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import bookshop from '@bookshop/astro-bookshop';

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  integrations: [bookshop()]
});
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Now that Bookshop is installed and your Astro site can access it, we can look at creating and using components.
