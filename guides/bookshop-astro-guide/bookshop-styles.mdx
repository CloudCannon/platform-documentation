Bookshop provides helpers for writing SCSS styles alongside your components.
While not required, this can help organize your component directory and keep components self-contained.


## The Bookshop SCSS file

To add a Bookshop SCSS file for a component just create a `.scss` file next to your component with
the same name, just like the Bookshop data file from [Using Structures](/documentation/guides/bookshop-astro-guide/using-structures).

So, if we wanted to add styles for our sample component we would create a `sample.scss` file in the same
folder as our `sample.astro` file. Afterwards our directory structure will look like:

<comp.Tree>
```
src/
>> components/
>  >> sample/
>     >> sample.eleventy.liquid
>     >> sample.bookshop.yml
>     >> sample.scss #*
```
</comp.Tree>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  These files are completely optional, and can be safely deleted
  if you would rather maintain your component styles elsewhere.
</comp.Notice>

## Global Bookshop SCSS

In addition to per component SCSS files you can also use Bookshop to include global SCSS files
which will affect all components on your site. Global SCSS files live in the `shared/styles` directory,
so a site with a single `global.scss` might look like this:

<comp.Tree>
```
src/
>> shared/
   >> styles/
      >> global.scss #*
```
</comp.Tree>

Bookshop first imports all styles that exist in the `shared/styles/` directory, followed by all component styles
in alphabetical order. As such the `shared/styles/` directory is a great place to define any variables or mixins
that your component styles will use.

## Building your Bookshop SCSS

To include Bookshop styles on an Astro website, Bookshop provides a `@bookshop/sass` package 
to include as part of your build step:

<comp.CodeBlock language="bash" source="Command line">
```
npx @bookshop/sass -b src -o public/css/bookshop.css
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

This compiles all of the styles from your Bookshop directory,
and outputs a CSS file ready to be referenced on your website or imported into another style pipeline.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  The `@bookshop/sass` command will run any PostCSS plugins you have configured in your working directory.
</comp.Notice>

To easily add this command as part of your workflow, install the `@bookshop/sass` package and reference
`bookshop-sass` from your package.json:

<comp.CodeBlock language="json" source="package.json">
```
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "sass:build": "bookshop-sass -b src -o public/css/bookshop.css",
    "sass:watch": "bookshop-sass -b src -o public/css/bookshop.css -w"
  }
}
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Run `npx @bookshop/sass --help` to see the available options.
</comp.Notice>
