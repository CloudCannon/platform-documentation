Bookshop provides helpers for writing SCSS styles alongside your components.
While not required, this can help organize your component directory and keep components self-contained.


## The Bookshop SCSS file

The last files for us to cover from the `@bookshop/init` command we ran earlier are the SCSS files that were
created for us.

<comp.Tree>
```
_component-library/
>> components/
>  >> sample/
>     >> sample.eleventy.liquid
>     >> sample.bookshop.yml
>     >> sample.scss #*
>> shared/
   >> styles/
      >> global.scss #*
```
</comp.Tree>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  These files are completely optional, and can be safely deleted
  if you would rather maintain your component styles elsewhere.
</comp.Notice>

To include Bookshop styles on an Eleventy website, Bookshop provides a `@bookshop/sass` package 
to include as part of your build step:

<comp.CodeBlock language="bash" source="Command line">
```
npx @bookshop/sass -b component-library -o site/css/bookshop.css
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

This compiles all of the styles from your Bookshop directory,
and outputs a CSS file ready to be referenced on your website or imported into another style pipeline.

Bookshop first imports all styles that exist in the `shared/styles/` directory, followed by all component styles
in alphabetical order. As such the `shared/styles/` directory is a great place to define any variables or mixins
that your component styles will use.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  The `@bookshop/sass` command will run any PostCSS plugins you have configured in your working directory.
</comp.Notice>

To easily add this command as part of your workflow, install the `@bookshop/sass` package and reference
`bookshop-sass` from your package.json:

<comp.CodeBlock language="json" source="package.json">
```
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "sass:build": "bookshop-sass -b component-library -o site/css/bookshop.css",
    "sass:watch": "bookshop-sass -b component-library -o site/css/bookshop.css -w"
  }
}
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Run `npx @bookshop/sass --help` to see the available options.
</comp.Notice>
