Bookshop components use the templating language of your chosen static site generator.
For Astro, Bookshop supports writing components as `.astro` files, or as React in either `.jsx` or `.tsx` files.

## Creating your first component

Bookshop components live in the `src/components/` directory that Astro creates by default.
Each component can either be placed at the top level of a folder, or nested in folder matching that components name.

To start, lets have a look at a sample bookshop component. Create an empty file at `src/components/sample/sample.astro` in your site
and add the following content:

<comp.CodeBlock language="astro" source="src/components/sample/sample.astro">
```
<div class="c-sample">
  <p>{ Astro.props.text }</p>
</div>
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

If you're used to writing Astro templates on your site, the contents of this component should be very familiar.
Beyond the special directory structure that this component should live in, any existing components should be
compatible with Bookshop without any changes. Notice that this component is nested in a folder with the same name as the component.
This doesn't change the components Bookshop name (`sample`) but can be useful for grouping files related to this component.

Here's a hypothetical React component that uses more advanced syntax:

<comp.CodeBlock language="jsx" source="src/components/hero.jsx">
```
export default ({ date, title, subtitle }) => {
  return <div class="c-hero">
    <p className="date">Published on {date.toLocaleDateString()}</p>
    <h1>{ title }</h1>
    {subtitle && <h2>{ subtitle }</h2>}
  </div>;
}
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

As with the Astro example, this component is using standard React JSX and any existing React components should largely be
compatible with Bookshop by default. With this component we've opted not to nest it inside a folder. This can be cleaner when
creating individual components that don't have any supporting files. 

## Supported templating and functions

There are some restrictions on the features you can use inside your components.
Since Bookshop renders your components in the browser, any functions or packages that you use must be able to run in a browser.
Bookshop will include any `.png`, `.svg`, `.jpg`, and `.webp` assets imported by your components for live editing,
but other assets types are not supported.
