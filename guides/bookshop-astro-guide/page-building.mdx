With your components live rendering and your Structures created in CloudCannon, we now have the ingredients to create a page-building experience in the CMS.

## Looping components

Once you have a few more components built out, an ideal front-matter section might look like this:

<comp.CodeBlock language="yml" source="src/pages/index.md">
```
---
layout: ../layouts/PageLayout.astro
content_blocks:

  - _bookshop_name: hero
    title: Kākā
    subtitle: The New Zealand kākā is a large species of parrot

  - _bookshop_name: content
    content_markdown: >-
      The New Zealand kākā lives in lowland and mid-altitude native forest

  - _bookshop_name: image
    image_url: /uploads/Scrapping_kaka.jpg
    image_alt: The bird that screams loudest and most persistently gets to own the branch

  - _bookshop_name: stats
    length: 45cm
    weight: 452g
    color: reddish
---
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Now we need to create a page component that loops over each item in this array and renders them on the page using the dynamic components we covered in [Using Bookshop components](/documentation/guides/bookshop-astro-guide/using-components/#rendering-dynamic-components).
Instead of creating this component in our regular `src/components` directory we're going to create this component in our Bookshop shared components directory. We'll explain what this means later, but for now create a `shared/astro` directory in your `src` folder.
This directory is where we'll place all our future shared components. Next, create an empty `page.astro` component inside your `src/shared/astro` directory.

Afterward, you should have a directory structure like this:
<comp.Tree>
```
src/
>> components/
>  >> sample/
>     >> sample.astro
>> shared/
   >> astro/
      >> page.astro #*
```
</comp.Tree>

Now add the following code to your `page.astro` component:
<comp.CodeBlock language="astro" source="src/shared/astro/page.astro">
```
---
const { contentBlocks } = Astro.props;
const components = import.meta.glob("../../components/**/*.astro", {
  eager: true,
});
---

<main>
  {contentBlocks.map((block) => {
    const name = `../../components/${block._bookshop_name}.astro`;
    const Component = components[name].default;
    return <Component {...block} />;
  })}
</main>

```
</comp.CodeBlock>

This example implementation loads all the Astro components in your components library and renders them according
to the `contentBlocks` array prop.

We'll also need to add a layout that passes the `content_blocks` array from the markdown to our new page component.
<comp.CodeBlock language="astro" source="src/layouts/PageLayout.astro">
```
---
import Page from '../shared/astro/page.astro';

const { frontmatter } = Astro.props;
---

<Page bookshop:live contentBlocks={frontmatter.content_blocks} />
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Note that we don't need to add the `bookshop:live` directive to the subcomponents within a page
because the entire page component is already live rendering.

It is important to put our component loop inside another Bookshop component rather than
using it directly in our layout because Bookshop can only live render changes within
the boundaries of Bookshop components. If we look at the loop in our page component and note where
the internal live editing boundaries would be, it will look like this:

<comp.CodeBlock language="astro" source="src/shared/astro/page.astro">
```
{frontmatter.content_blocks.map((block) => {
  const name = `../components/${block._bookshop_name}.astro`;
  const Component = components[name].default;
  return <>
    {/* start live editing */}
    <Component bookshop:live {...block} />;
    {/* end live editing */}
  </>
})}
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

So if we were to use this loop directly, each component individually would update changes live,
but rearranging or adding new components wouldn't render correctly
because the outer `frontmatter.content_blocks.map` loop wouldn't get re-rendered.
Adding the loop to a page component ensures that the entire loop is contained within a live editing boundary and is re-rendered whenever components are added or moved.

## Shared Components

Earlier we introduced the `shared/astro` directory for shared components. Shared components are components
that need to re-render in the Visual Editor but aren't semantically a "component"
that an editor would add to a page. In the previous section, we made our page component a shared component
because we needed it to re-render our `content_blocks` array, but editors shouldn't be able to add page
components within a page. Apart from this distinction, these files are
functionally the same as your other components and can be imported and used the same way.

## Taking stock

With the steps taken so far, you should have the framework for a fully functional page builder, rendering live when editing on CloudCannon. Now is a great moment to jump into your codebase, start migrating some components, and experiment with the system.

The following sections of this guide will cover some of Bookshop's remaining features that can help polish the page-building experience, but aren't required while setting things up.
