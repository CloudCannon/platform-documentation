    ### Bookshop

    We’ve created <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop">Bookshop</a> to automate maintaining page components for page building. Bookshop is an open-source component library compatible with Astro, Eleventy, Hugo, Jekyll, and SvelteKit. It’s simple to introduce and has tight integration into CloudCannon, which will handle most of the setup.

    To get started with Bookshop, read our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop/">Bookshop guide</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/support/">reach out to our support team</a>.
