    ## Bookshop

    We’ve created <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop">Bookshop</a> to automate maintaining page components for page building. Bookshop is an open-source component library compatible with Astro, Eleventy, Hugo, Jekyll, and SvelteKit. It’s simple to introduce and has tight integration into CloudCannon, which will handle most of the setup.

    To get started with Bookshop, read our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop/">Bookshop guide</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/support/">reach out to our support team</a>.

    ## Snippets

    CloudCannon supports embedding rich Snippets in Markdown files when using the Content Editor. Snippets appear as blocks in your rich text view, and once configured, the Snippets icon in your WYSIWYG toolbar will provide a modal menu for your content team to select from.

    CloudCannon supports several types of snippets/shortcodes.

    * [Custom MDX Components guide](/documentation/articles/snippets-using-mdx-components/#custom-mdx-components)
    * [Custom Python Markdown Extensions guide](/documentation/articles/snippets-using-python-markdown/#custom-snippets)
    * [Custom Eleventy Shortcodes guide](/documentation/articles/snippets-using-eleventy-shortcodes/#custom-eleventy-shortcodes)
    * [Custom Hugo Shortcodes guide](/documentation/articles/snippets-using-hugo-shortcodes/#custom-hugo-shortcodes)
    * [Custom Docusaurus Component guide](/documentation/articles/snippets-using-docusaurus-components/)

    Check if your SSG uses snippets with similar syntax to any of the above types. To get started, use one of our guides to import snippets or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/support/">reach out to our support team</a>.
