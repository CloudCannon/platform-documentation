Welcome to the Universal CloudCannon starter guide! If you want to get a site set up on CloudCannon site built, editable, and live on CloudCannon, but you aren't using one of our officially supported SSGs, you are in the right place.

Before we start, this guide assumes you already have a site uploaded to a Git repository. Although you can <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/add-files-with-direct-upload/">upload files directly</a> from your hard drive, we highly recommend using a Git repository.

Donâ€™t have any site yet? No worries! You can create one with our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/tutorials/">Jamstack tutorials for your favorite SSGs</a>.
