    CloudCannon will try to auto-detect which static site generator your repository is using. If you are using a custom SSG, or one that CloudCannon does not support, the dropdown menu will display&nbsp;*Custom*.

    Enter the necessary build options so your site matches your local build environment. If you have a custom source directory or require environment variables for parts of your build, enter them here.

    * Any required environment variables.
    * Install Command: Configure the command to install dependencies before the build. By default, this runs `npm install`. This is run as a line of bash and can be anything you want. A common change here is to use `yarn install` instead, or the install command for your custom SSG's toolchain.
    * Build Command: Configure the command to build your site. By default, this runs `npm run build`.
    * Output Path: Configure the path to the output folder you are building into. CloudCannon needs to know which folder to treat as the static output of your site. By default, CloudCannon will look for a `public` directory.
