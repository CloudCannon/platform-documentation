site has a posts page bundle for the blog.

## Everything else

Everything we’ve been through so far is accessible for your editing team.
The rest of the items are visible for developers only. We have:

* **Status** — Show the current status of your Git sync and build output.

* **Files** — A browser showing all the source files on the site.

* **Reports** — Lists the build information, syncs, and CloudCannon
activity on your site.

* **Settings** — Configure your build setting, hosting, sharing and other
site settings.
