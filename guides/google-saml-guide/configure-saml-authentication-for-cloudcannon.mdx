For more information, check out our documentation on [enabling SAML authentication](/documentation/articles/enable-saml-authentication/).

1. In CloudCannon, go to your site's Site Settings / Authentication
2. Select SAML and click **Switch to SAML authentication**
3. Enter the following details:
   * Paste the SSO URL into “SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP)”
   * Leave the Issuer Suffix blank. \*\*\*\*(If you’re setting up multiple CloudCannon sites with the same SAML app, you can distinguish between them with a unique suffix.)
   * Paste the contents of the downloaded IdP certificate into “X.509 Certificate” (Alternatively, you can click **Fill cert using XML Metadata** and upload the certificate.)
4. Click **Update SAML Configuration**

&nbsp;

Congratulations! Your site is now secured with Google authentication. Only members of your Google Workspace organization can access it. Test the setup by visiting your site and attempting to log in.
