Here at CloudCannon, we use Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) to manage our emails and calendars, as well as collaborate and share files through services like Google Drive. When new team members join they receive access to our internal documentation, which includes a range of secure sites hosted on CloudCannon.

These sites are secured with SAML authentication through Google, ensuring only authorized organization members can access them. When someone on our team leaves (ðŸ˜­), disabling their Google Workspace account automatically revokes their access to the internal websites.
