If you’d like, you can follow Google’s instructions directly. (Note that you’ll need to be signed in with a super administrator’s account to complete these steps.)

1. Log in to the Google Admin Portal.
2. Select **Apps**. Click on **Web and mobile apps**.
3. Select **Add custom SAML app** from the dropdown **Add App** menu.
   * Enter the name of your app.
   * Click **Continue**.
4. In the Google Identity Provider section:
   * Download the **IdP metadata**, **Certificate**, and **SHA-256 fingerprint**
   * Copy the **SSO URL** (you’ll need this in CloudCannon).
   * Click **Continue**.
5. Configure the Service Provider Details, replacing `staging.[example.com](<http://example.com/>)` with your site's domain:
   * ACS URL: `https://staging.example.com/login/consume`
   * Entity ID: `cloudcannon.com/`
   * Start URL(optional; this functions as a redirect after authentication): `https://staging.example.com/`
6. Check the **Signed response** box.
7. Set the Name ID format to EMAIL, and leave **Name ID** as **Basic Information &gt; Primary email.**
8. Click **Continue.**
9. On the next screen, Attribute Mapping, click **Finish**.
10. Back in the **Web and mobile apps** section, you can now turn on your SAML app.
    * Select **On for everyone.**
    * Click **Save**.

Once you’ve saved your settings, it can take a few minutes for your changes to take effect.

&lt;aside&gt;

**Note:** The interface labels and exact navigation paths in Google’s Admin Portal may vary slightly as Google updates their UI. If you can't find a specific option, use the search function in the Admin Console or consult Google's current documentation.
