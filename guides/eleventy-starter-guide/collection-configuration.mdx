    ## CloudCannon Plugin

    If you're reading your build logs in CloudCannon, you'll see a build step that runs `@cloudcannon/eleventy-plugin-cloudcannon` after your SSG.

    CloudCannon Reader is the tool that scans your global configuration file and processes your collections. This tool runs automatically, so there isn't anything you need to do.

    If you want to look under the hood or customize your config further, Reader is open-source on GitHub at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/eleventy-plugin-cloudcannon">CloudCannon Eleventy plugin</a>.

  <comp.SlotContent name="SSG_Configuration_Paragraph">
    CloudCannon provides basic content editing for Eleventy without any configuration. However, we recommend you use a global configuration file to get the most out of the platform. CloudCannon gives you complete control to fine-tune the editing experience for you and your team members.

    <comp.Notice info_type="info">
      In some SSGs, such as Eleventy, CloudCannon will partially define your collections for you. The CloudCannon Eleventy Plugin will automatically detect the collection name, path, and output, but other inputs require configuration. You can see this information in the Configuration GUI.
