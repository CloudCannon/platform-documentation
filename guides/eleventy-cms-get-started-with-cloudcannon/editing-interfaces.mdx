There are four ways to manage content on CloudCannon: the [Visual
Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-visual-editor/), [Content
Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-content-editor/), [Data
Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-data-editor/), and the [Source
Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-source-editor/). Each editing interface is useful in
different situations.

## The Visual Editor

[The Visual
Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-visual-editor/) is the most intuitive way to edit content
on CloudCannon. Editable elements are indicated with a yellow box. Editors
can click on the element and add their new content, directly on the page.

The Visual Editor also features a sidebar for managing front matter
content. You can customize these inputs to give your editing team a more
intuitive interface. For example, showing a date picker for a date field,
adding a small comment to indicate how a field is used, or using a select
box to reference other pages on the site or data in a data file.

We’ll go deeper into how to configure CloudCannon later in this guide, or
if you want to skip ahead, read through the documentation on [Customizing
your
inputs](/documentation/articles/how-to-choose-what-input-is-used-in-the-data-editor/).

## Content Editor

[The Content
Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-content-editor/) is a rich text editor for Markdown files.
It’s useful if you want a distraction-free, clean writing interface. It’s
particularly useful for blog posts and other content with a simple layout.
Note that the Content Editor view also shows the Data Editor in the
left-hand panel, as pictured below.

## Data Editor

We’ve already seen the [Data
Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-data-editor/) — it’s the side bar for managing front
matter in the Visual and Content Editor. The Data Editor is also used to
manage content in YAML, TOML, JSON, CSV, and TSV files.

## Source Editor

[The Source
Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-source-editor/) is an in-browser code editor which is
great for make small, quick changes. As with all the Editors, any changes
sync back to your Git repository.
