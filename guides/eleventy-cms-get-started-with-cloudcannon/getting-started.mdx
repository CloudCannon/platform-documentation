Welcome to the CloudCannon Eleventy starter guide. If you’re looking to
get your Eleventy site set up on CloudCannon and ready to hand off to
content editors, you’re in the right place.

## What is CloudCannon?

CloudCannon is a Git-based CMS for websites built with static site
generators such as Eleventy. With CloudCannon, you can build and maintain
your Eleventy site using regular Git workflows **and** have your content
team easily update and manage the content without knowing anything about
Eleventy, Git, Markdown, or even HTML.

## Setting up your site

So you’ve got your Eleventy site ready to go in a Git repository? To get
it set up on CloudCannon we need to sync your Git repository with
CloudCannon and then configure your Eleventy build.

### Syncing your site

If you haven’t already, [sign up for
CloudCannon](https://app.cloudcannon.com/register) and create a new site with the “use your own files”
option.


Enter a site name and select the Git platform your site lives on. If this
is your first time using CloudCannon you’ll need to give permission for
CloudCannon to access the Git platform.

After confirming your Git platform, a repository field will show which
lists all the repositories on your account. Select your site repository
from the list:

For the branch you’ll likely want to select “use existing”. If you want to
try out CloudCannon without impacting your main branch you can select
“Create new”. Either way, select or create your branch:

Press “Sync Files” at the bottom right to move onto the next step.

### Building your site

CloudCannon auto-detects your static site generator. If it gets it wrong
you can select the correct SSG from the dropdown.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/cloudcannon-eleventy-build.png" alt="Screenshot showing user building site on CloudCannon" type="screenshot" />

From here, enter the necessary build options for your site to match your
local build environment. If you have a simple set up, you may not need to
enter anything here. If you have a custom source directory or require
environment variables for parts of your build, this is the place to enter
them.

Once you’re finished click “Build Site”.

Before the build, CloudCannon automatically adds the [CloudCannon Eleventy
plugin](https://github.com/CloudCannon/eleventy-plugin-cloudcannon) to map out the structure and content of
your site which powers the content editing interfaces.

If your site builds successfully, you’re ready to go on CloudCannon\! As a
side bonus, CloudCannon also provides hosting. You can now access a live
preview version (not indexed by search engines) of your site by clicking
on the *.cloudvent.net* address at the top left:

If your site failed to build, you have some debugging work to do. Read the
build output to see why it failed, double check your build settings, and
try again.


You may need to run extra commands before or after your build to get your
site in the right state. For example, you may need to install npm packages
for your site.


On CloudCannon you can run extra commands at different points of the build
using a build hook. For more information, see [the build hook
documentation](/documentation/articles/extending-your-build-process-with-hooks/).


If you can’t figure it out, don’t hesitate to [get in touch with our
support team](/documentation/support/). We’re always here to help.
