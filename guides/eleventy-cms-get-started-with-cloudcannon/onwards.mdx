## Hosting

CloudCannon is an all-in-one CMS with hosting included. Every site gets
their [own .cloudvent.net domain
name](/documentation/articles/viewing-your-site-on-a-testing-domain/) hosted on a blazing fast CDN backed by
CloudFlare. For a production site, you can [point your own domain at your
site](/documentation/articles/hosting-your-site-on-a-custom-domain/) or use [CloudCannon
DNS](/documentation/articles/using-cloudcannon-dns-to-configure-your-custom-domain/)
to automate the set up.

All sites get an SSL certificate, scale to meet any traffic demands, can
have [custom routing and
headers](/documentation/articles/configuring-custom-routing/#custom-headers), [handle form
submissions](/documentation/articles/getting-started-with-forms-on-cloudcannon/), and [a variety of authentication
options](/documentation/articles/adding-password-authentication-to-your-site/).

That should give you a good overview of how to get the most out of
