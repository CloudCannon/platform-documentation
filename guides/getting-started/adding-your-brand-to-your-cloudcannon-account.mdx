Make your CloudCannon account look and feel like your organization by adding custom brand details.

You can do this by setting the primary colour across the app â€” this is mainly used in the side nav and buttons. You can also add your logo in two places: a badge in the top left corner with your brand's primary colour behind it, and on the top of the Home, Project, Sites, and Domains pages with a white background behind it.

Visit the [branding section](/documentation/articles/customizing-cloudcannon-to-match-your-brand/) for details on adding your custom branding or head to *Settings* in the Organization menu to see your options.
