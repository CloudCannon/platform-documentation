Welcome to CloudCannon's getting started guide!

CloudCannon is a Git-based Content Management System designed to help teams (or individuals) manage their website content and code. Developers can commit changes to your Git repository that sync to CloudCannon. At the same time, non-technical team members can effortlessly update and manage your content without knowing anything about Git, Markdown, or HTML. All your files are stored safely and securely in your Git repository â€” no vendor lock-in.

In this guide, we'll cover how to create an account, add your files to a Site, and set yourself up for success on CloudCannon. By the end of this guide, you will have set up a basic Site in CloudCannon and learnt important skills for managing your content.

Before we begin, this guide assumes you already have a website and your files are uploaded to a Git repository. Although you can <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/create-a-site-with-direct-upload/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upload files directly</a> from your hard drive, we highly recommend using a Git repository.
