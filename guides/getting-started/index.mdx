2. Head to *Sites*
3. Click **Add new site** and select **Browse templates**
4. Use the dropdown menu to select your preferred static site generator
5. Browse the templates and click on one to select it as your option
6. The final step is to name your site and click **Create**
7. You’ll see a terminal window and progress bar showing you what’s going on behind the scenes
8. Once built, you’ll be directed to your site in CloudCannon with a confirmation screen — from there, you can click **Open my visual editor** to see the site or explore the site files
