Dev Mode is the tool that allows you to customize your Site configuration on CloudCannon. The *Dev Mode* switch on the right of your *Site header* allows you to toggle Dev Mode on and off.

When Dev Mode is on, CloudCannon will display *Edit configuration* buttons next to each element of the app you can configure. These *Edit configuration* buttons are all in purple, making them easy to find and visually distinct from other UI elements.

When Dev Mode is off, CloudCannon hides all the *Edit configuration* buttons, creating an uncluttered interface for content creators. We recommend spending most of your time with Dev Mode off for a better editing experience, but you can always turn it on to make a quick change your Site configuration.

In the previous step of this guide, we used the *\+ Add Collections* button in the *Site navigation* to add your Collections to your Site. The *\+ Add Collections* button is one example of an *Edit configuration* button. When you click on an *Edit configuration* button, CloudCannon will open a modal or data panel to show you what options you can configure.

Whenever you update your configuration, CloudCanon adds your preferences to your CloudCannon Configuration File.

  **Who can use Dev Mode?**

  Turning on Dev Mode only affects the way your Site looks for you; the purple *Edit configuration* buttons do not appear for other users of your Site.

  You can restrict the capacity to use Dev Mode to specific team members. We'll cover permissions later in the [Add your team to CloudCannon](/documentation/guides/getting-started/add-your-team-to-cloudcannon/) step of this guide.

Try navigating to different pages on your Site, like the *Dashboard* or a *Collection browser*, and toggling the *Dev Mode* switch on and off. It's a good idea to become familiar with what is configurable on your Site.

In the next step of this guide, we'll cover how to edit your files in one of CloudCannon's editing interfaces, and save your changes back to your Git repository.
