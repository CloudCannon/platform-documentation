  Learn about Collections in CloudCannon, including what they are and how to add
  them.
---
A major benefit to using a CMS is the ability to organize your files in a user-friendly interface for easy browsing. When you add your website files to a Site on CloudCannon, you and your content team view your files in a *Collection Browser*, allowing you to sort, filter, and scroll through previews of the files you want to edit.

In CloudCannon, a Collection is a group of similar files stored in the same folder of your website (e.g., a folder of pages, blog posts, products, or data files). Once you add a Collection to your CloudCannon Configuration File, you can open the *Collection Browser* through a link in your *Site Navigation*.

Adding your Collections is the next task on your *Getting started* task list. Let's add one.

## Adding Collections using Configuration Mode

When you created your CloudCannon Configuration File in the previous step, CloudCannon turned on Configuration Mode. The switch that controls whether Configuration Mode is on or off is on the right side of your *Site Header*. We'll discuss Configuration Mode more in the [next step of this guide](/documentation/guides/getting-started/check-out-dev-mode/), but for now, it's only important that you know Configuration Mode is on.

When Configuration Mode is on, CloudCannon will show a purple button next to things you can configure in the app. One of these is the *\+ Add Collections* button in the *Site Navigation.*

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-No-Collections" alt="A screenshot of the Site Dashboard shows the Getting Started task list and a purple Add Collections button in the Site Navigation." title="The Site Dashboard" type="screenshot"/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If you need to add more Collections to your Site in the future, the *\+Add Collections* button will appear in the *Site Navigation* whenever you turn on Configuration Mode.
</comp.Notice>

Click on the *\+ Add Collections* button. CloudCannon will open the *Add Collections* modal.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Add-Collections-Modal-Detected" alt="A screenshot of the Add Collections modal shows radio buttons for selecting Choose from detected Collections or Create a custom Collection." title="The Add Collections modal" type="screenshot"/>

There are two ways to add Collections to your Site. CloudCannon will detect potential Collections in your website files. You can choose any number of these detected Collections, or create a custom Collection by manually entering a few initial details.

Regardless of your chosen method, CloudCannon will convert your answers to YAML and add them to your Configuration File under the `collections_config` key. You can expand the *Additional content for `/cloudcannon.config.yml`* dropdown at the bottom of the *Add Collections* modal to see the content CloudCannon will add to your file.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````

collections_config:
  news:
    path: /blog/news/
    icon: breaking_news

``````````
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

### Choose from detected Collections

Choosing from the Collections detected by CloudCannon is the easiest method for adding Collections. To use this method, ensure the *Choose from detected Collections* radio button is enabled.

When CloudCannon detects Collections in your Site files, it defines a key, path, icon, and files for each Collection. You can review the details for each detected Collection under the *Detected Collections* section of the modal.

You can see the key, path, and icon on the Collection Card. Clicking on the Collection Card to expand it will show what files belong to that Collection.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Add-Collections-Modal-Detected-Open" alt="A screenshot of the Add Collections modal shows several detected Collections with one Card expanded to show the included files." title="The Add Collections modal" type="screenshot"/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p><strong>What Collection does a file belong to?</strong></p><p>Files can only belong to one Collection at a time. If you add two Collections that a file could belong to, the file will appear in the Collection with the most specific path. Let's walk through an example.</p><comp.DocsImage path="" alt="An illustration..." title="" type="ui-snippet"/><p>Assume you have an <code>authors</code> folder nested in your <code>blog</code> folder (i.e., <code>/blog/authors/</code>). The <code>authors</code> folder contains non-output data files with profile information about your various blog authors. In addition to the <code>authors</code> folder, the <code>blog</code> folder also contains all your output blog files. In this case, both the <code>authors</code> and <code>blog</code> folders could be Collections.</p><p>If you only define the "Blog" Collection with the path <code>/blog/</code>, all your output blog files will belong to this Collection, but so will all the data files inside <code>/blog/authors/</code>. All these files will appear in your Blog <em>Collection Browser</em>. Defining the "Blog" Collection and the "Authors" Collection will separate these files, keeping your output blog files in one <em>Collection Browser</em> and your non-output data files in another.</p>
</comp.Notice>

At the top left of each Collection Card is a checkbox, which controls whether the *\+ Add Collections* button will add that Collection to your Configuration File. By default, all the detected Collections will have a ticked checkbox. If you don't want to add a particular Collection, you can untick the checkbox.

When you are happy with your selection, click the *\+ Add Collections* button at the bottom of the modal.

### Create a custom Collection

Adding a custom Collection manually allows you to specify the configuration details, which is helpful if you have a specific setup in mind that isn't covered by the Collections CloudCannon automatically detects. To use this method, click the *Create a custom Collection* radio button.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Add-Collections-Modal-Custom" alt="A screenshot of the Add Collections modal shows that the Create a custom Collection radio button is selected." title="The Add Collections modal" type="screenshot"/>

To start with, we'll give each Collection a path, key, and icon. We also have the option to add a display name instead of the default, which matches the key

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Add-Collections-Modal-Custom-Fields" alt="A screenshot of the Add Collections modal shows the path, key, name, and icon text fields for manually creating a Collection." title="The Add Collections modal" type="screenshot"/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  There is a lot more you can define for each Collection, which we cover in the [Configure your Collections](/documentation/guides/configure-your-collections/) guide. We recommend you check out this guide after you have finished Getting Started.
</comp.Notice>

Each Collection must have a unique file path: the location in your repository where your Collection files are stored. Your path must be relative to your Source Folder, which you defined in the previous step of this guide, [Create your CloudCannon Configuration File](/documentation/guides/getting-started/create-your-cloudcannon-configuration-file/). Enter a unique path in the *Path* text field.

The Collection key defines the unique key under which CloudCannon stores all your Collection information in your Configuration File. Enter a unique key in the *Key* text field.

By default, CloudCannon uses the key in title case for the name of your Collection (i.e., `travel_blog` becomes "Travel Blog"). However, you can define a display name to overwrite this default and change the text that appears in your *Site Navigation* and at the top of your *Collection Browser*.  We recommend choosing a short name that provides context about the files in the Collection. Enter a display name in the *Display name* text field.

Each Collection has an icon from [Google's Material Symbols and Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Symbols&amp;icon.style=Rounded) to add context and make it visually distinct in the *Site Navigation*. By default, CloudCannon selects the icon with the most similar name to the Collection key. You can define a custom icon for your Collection by entering the icon name in the *Icon* text field.

When you are happy with your configuration, click the *\+ Add Collection* button at the bottom of the modal.

## Tour your *Collection Browser*

Let's take a tour of your new Collections and point out some important UI. If you would rather continue configuring CloudCannon, feel free to skip straight to the next step in this guide.

Click on a Collection in your *Site Navigation* to open the *Collection Browser*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Navigation-New-Collections" alt="A screenshot of the Site Navigation shows that several Collections are now present." title="The Site Navigation" type="ui-snippet"/>

You may notice that several UI elements in your *Collections Browser* are purple. That's because these elements are all configurable, allowing you to customize your CloudCannon experience.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Configuration-Mode-On" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows several UI elements highlighted in Configuration Mode purple." title="The Collection Browser" type="screenshot"/>

For now, let's hide this UI by clicking on the purple *Configuration Mode* *switch* on the right of your *Site Header* to turn it off. We'll discuss Configuration Mode more in the [next step of this guide](/documentation/guides/getting-started/check-out-dev-mode/).

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Header-Tools" alt="A screenshot of the Site Header tools shows the Avatar List, Configuration Mode toggle, and the Save button with one unsaved change." title="The Site Header tools" type="ui-snippet"/>

Your *Collection Browser* allows you to browse, sort, and filter your Collection files.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Unconfigured-Collection" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows several tools for browsing, sorting, and filtering your Collection files." title="The Collection Browser" type="screenshot"/>

At the top left of your *Collection Browser*, underneath your *Site Header*, is the name of your Collection. This will be the same as the Collection name in the *Site Navigation*.

Under the Collection name are the *Collection Browser controls*: the *Change sorting* *menu*, *Change view* *menu*, *Filter* text field, and the *\+ Add menu*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser controls shows the Change sorting menu, Change view menu, Filter text field, and the + Add menu." title="The Collection Browser controls" type="ui-snippet"/>

The *Change sorting* *menu* allows you to change how CloudCannon sorts your Collection files. By default, you can sort your files alphabetically by file path, or numerically by file size, date and time of file creation, or date and time the file was last modified.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls-Sort-Dropdown" alt="A screenshot of the Change sorting menu in the Collection Browser shows a dropdown with several options for sorting Collection files." title="The Change sorting menu" type="ui-snippet"/>

The *Change view* *menu* allows you to change how your files appear in the *Collection Browser*. You can switch between three view options: *List*, *Cards*, and *Gallery*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls-View-Dropdown" alt="A screenshot of the Change view menu in the Collection Browser shows a dropdown with several options for Collection file appearance." title="The Change view menu" type="ui-snippet"/>

The default view in your *Collection Browser* is the *Gallery* view. When the *Gallery* view option is selected, the *Collection Browser*  displays the file name, file path, the icon for the Collection, and has a gallery section for each file in a rectangular Card. The gallery section of the Card can display an image from within the file or a preview screenshot of the webpage.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-View-Gallery" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows files in Gallery view, with an image section for each file." title="The Collection Browser in Gallery view" type="screenshot"/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p>The gallery section of your file Card can also display a "No preview available" or "Failed to load image" warning.</p><p>"No preview available" indicates that the preview screenshot has not been configured. This will be the case for Sites that have not been built. We'll cover screenshots more in the <a href="/documentation/guides/getting-started/choose-building-or-headless/">Choose building or headless</a> step of this guide.</p><p>"Failed to load image" indicates that an error has occurred, and CloudCannon could not load the preview screenshot. Refreshing your browser may fix this.</p>
</comp.Notice>

When the *Card* view option is selected, the *Collection Browser* displays the file name, file path, and the icon for the Collection for each file in a rectangular Card. This is similar to the *Gallery* view, except without a section for an image.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-View-Card" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows files in Card view." title="The Collection Browser in Card view" type="screenshot"/>

When the *List* view option is selected, the *Collection Browser* displays the file name, file path, and the icon for the Collection for each file in a horizontal Card.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-View-List" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows files in List view." title="The Collection Browser in List view" type="screenshot"/>

By typing in the *Filter* text field, you can filter your Collection files to show file paths that match a given string.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls-Filtered-Files" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows that a text string in the Collection Filter has filtered the files shown." title="The Collection Browser" type="screenshot"/>

The *\+ Add* button allows you to add new files and folders to a Collection, which you can save back to your Git repository.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls-Add-Menu-Dropdown" alt="A screenshot of the + Add menu in the Collection Browser shows a dropdown with options to add a new file or folder." title="The + Add menu" type="ui-snippet"/>

In the next step of this guide, we'll cover Configuration Mode, including what it does and how to enable it.
