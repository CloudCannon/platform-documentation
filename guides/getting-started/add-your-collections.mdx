Initial collections

What are collections?

How to add them?

Where to find them?

We'll come back to collections later

&nbsp;

In the next step of this guide, we'll cover...

* **Collection** â€” A group of related files with a similar format (e.g., a folder of pages, blog posts, or data files). In CloudCannon, your collections appear in the *Site Navigation* for easy access.

Click the *Generate a configuration file* button to create your CloudCannon configuration file. The CloudCannon configuration file can be JSON or YAML. In this guide, we'll generate the `cloudcannon.config.yml` file.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  CloudCannon uses the information found in your files to suggest configuration for your Site. Please review this carefully.
</comp.Notice>

<comp.Slot name="SSG-Selector-Sentence">
  Select which SSG your Site uses with the *Static Site Generator* dropdown.
</comp.Slot>

To define your collections, CloudCannon needs to know where to find your files. Use the *Source* dropdown to ensure the path for your source is correct. Usually, this is the root of your repository, so you can leave this field empty. However, if your Git repository uses a nested folder as the source for your Site, you must select the correct base path.

Review the Collections suggested by CloudCannon in the *Collections* array. By default, CloudCannon will sort your Collections in the following order: the *Pages* Collection, all output Collections in alphabetical order, then all non-output Collections in alphabetical order.

You can reorder, rename, add, delete, and clone each collection using the *Context menu* in the top right of each collection card or click the *\+ Add collection* button to add a new collection. You can further configure the key, path, and appearance in the *App Navigation* sidebar, editing interfaces, and more by clicking on a collection card.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If you update your SSG or source path, CloudCannon will prompt you to regenerate your configuration file. These values are the foundation of your configuration file and affect many areas of your Site, including collection configuration.

  We recommend regenerating your configuration file before you move on to customizing your collection configuration.
</comp.Notice>

During the initial Site set-up, the most important thing to ensure is that your SSG and source path are correct and that each of your Collections is present and contains the correct files. You can return to your CloudCannon configuration file later to customize your experience.

Once you are happy with your initial configuration file, click the *Save* button and confirm your changes in the *Review changes* modal.

CloudCannon will commit your configuration file to the root level of your Git repository.
