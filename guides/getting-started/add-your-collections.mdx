A major benefit to using a CMS is the ability to organize your files in a user-friendly interface for easy browsing. When you add your website files to a Site on CloudCannon, you and your content team view your files in a *Collection browser*, allowing you to sort, filter, and scroll through previews of the files you want to edit.

In CloudCannon, a Collection is a group of similar files stored in the same folder of your website (e.g., a folder of pages, blog posts, products, or data files). Once you add a Collection to your CloudCannon Configuration File, you can open the *Collection browser* through a link in your *Site navigation*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

Adding your Collections is the next task on your *Getting started* task list. Let's add one.

## Adding Collections using Dev Mode

When you created your CloudCannon Configuration File in the previous step, CloudCannon turned on Dev Mode. The switch that controls whether Dev Mode is on or off is on the right side of your *Site header*. We'll discuss Dev Mode more in the [next step of this guide](/documentation/guides/getting-started/check-out-dev-mode/), but for now, it's only important that you know Dev Mode is on.

When Dev Mode is on, CloudCannon will show a purple button next to things you can configure in the app. One of these is the *\+ Add Collections* button in the *Site navigation.*

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If you need to add more Collections to your Site in the future, the *\+Add Collections* button will appear in the *Site navigation* whenever you turn on Dev Mode.
</comp.Notice>

Click on the *\+ Add Collections* button. CloudCannon will open the *Add Collections* modal.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

There are two ways to add Collections to your Site. CloudCannon will detect potential Collections in your website files. You can choose any number of these detected Collections, or create a custom Collection by manually entering a few initial details.

Regardless of your chosen method, CloudCannon will convert your answers to YAML and add them to your Configuration File under the `collections_config` key. You can expand the *Additional content for`/cloudcannon.config.yml`* dropdown at the bottom of the *Add Collections* modal to see the content CloudCannon will add to your file.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

### Choose from detected Collections

Choosing from the Collections detected by CloudCannon is the easiest method for adding Collections. To use this method, ensure the *Choose from detected Collections* radio button is enabled.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

When CloudCannon detects Collections in your Site files, it defines a name, path, icon, and files for each Collection. You can review the details for each detected Collection under the *Detected Collections* section of the modal.

You can see the name, path, and icon on the Collection Card. Clicking on the Collection Card to expand it will show what files belong to that Collection.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  **What Collection does a file belong to?**

  Files can only belong to one Collection at a time. If you add two Collections that a file could belong to, the file will appear in the Collection with the most specific path. Let's walk through an example.

  <comp.DocsImage path="" alt="hish" title=""/>

  Assume you have an `authors` folder nested in your `blog` folder (i.e., `/blog/authors/`). The `authors` folder contains non-output data files with profile information about your various blog authors. In addition to the `authors` folder, the `blog` folder also contains all your output blog files. In this case, both the `authors` and `blog` folders could be Collections.

  If you only define the "Blog" Collection with the path `/blog/`, all your output blog files will belong to this Collection, but so will all the data files inside `/blog/authors/`. All these files will appear in your Blog *Collection browser*. Defining the "Blog" Collection and the "Authors" Collection will separate these files, keeping your output blog files in one *Collection browser* and your non-output data files in another.
</comp.Notice>

At the top left of each Collection Card is a checkbox, which controls whether the *\+ Add Collections* button will add that Collection to your Configuration File. By default, all the detected Collections will have a ticked checkbox. If you don't want to add a particular Collection you can untick the checkbox.

When you are happy with your selection, click the *\+ Add Collections* button at the bottom of the modal.

### Create a custom Collection

Adding a custom Collection manually allows you to specify the configuration details, which is helpful if you have a specific setup in mind that isn't covered by the Collections CloudCannon automatically detected. To use this method, click the *Create a custom Collection* radio button.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

There are lots of details you can define for each Collection, which we'll cover in further detail in the optional [configure your Collections](/documentation/guides/getting-started/configure-your-collections/) step of this guide. To start with, we'll give each Collection a path, key, name, and icon.

Each Collection must have a unique file path: the location in your repository where your Collection files are stored. Your path must be relative to your Source Folder, which you defined in the previous step of this guide, [Create your CloudCannon Configuration File](/documentation/guides/getting-started/create-your-cloudcannon-configuration-file/). Enter a unique path in the *Path* text field.

The Collection key defines the unique key under which CloudCannon stores all your Collection information in your Configuration File. Enter a unique key in the *Key* text field.

The display name of a Collection defines the text that appears in your *Site navigation* and at the top of your *Collection browser*. By default, CloudCannon uses the key name in title case (i.e., `travel_blog` becomes "Travel Blog"), however you can choose any name. We recommend choosing a short name that provides context about the files in the Collection. Enter a display name in the *Name* text field.

Each Collection has an icon from [Google's Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Symbols&amp;icon.style=Rounded) to add context and make it visually distinct in the *Site navigation*. By default, CloudCannon selects the icon with the most similar name to the Collection key. You can define a custom icon for your Collection by entering the icon name in the *Icon* text field.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````

collections_config:
  news:
    path: /blog/news/
    name: Company News
    icon: breaking_news

``````````
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

When you are happy with your configuration, click the *\+ Add Collection* button at the bottom of the modal.

## Tour your *Collection browser*

Let's take a tour of your new Collections and point out some important UI. If you would rather continue configuring CloudCannon, feel free to skip straight to the next step in this guide.

Your *Collection browser* allows you to browse, sort, and filter your Collection files. There are many optional elements you can configure in your *Collection browser*; we'll dive deeper into that in the [Configure your Collections](/documentation/guides/getting-started/configure-your-collections/) step of this guide. For now, let's take a look at the default configuration for one of your Collections.

Click on a Collection in your *Site navigation* to open the *Collection browser*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

At the top left of your *Collection browser*, underneath your *Site header*, is the name of your Collection. This will be the same as the Collection name in the *Site navigation*.

Under the Collection name is the *Change sorting* dropdown, *Change view* dropdown, *Filter* text field, and the *\+ Add* button.

The *Change sorting* dropdown allows you to change how CloudCannon sorts your Collection files. By default, you can sort your files alphabetically by file path, or numerically by file size, date and time of file creation, or date and time the file was last modified.

The *Change view* dropdown allows you to change how your files appear in the *Collection browser*. You can switch between three views: *List*, *Cards*, and *Gallery*.

List view

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

Cards view

The *Collection browser* uses Cards to represent all the files in a Collection. These Cards can preview information about each file, including the file name, metadata, structured data from within the file, images, and icons.

Gallery view

We'll come back to Collections later in the [Configure your Collections](/documentation/guides/getting-started/configure-your-collections/) step of this guide.

In the next step of this guide, we'll cover Dev Mode, including what it does and how to enable it.
