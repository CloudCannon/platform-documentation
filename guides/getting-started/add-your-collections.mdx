A major benefit to using a CMS is the ability to organize your files in a user-friendly interface for easy browsing. When you add your website files to a Site on CloudCannon, you and your content team view your files in a *Collection browser*, allowing you to sort, filter, and scroll through previews of the files you want to edit.

In CloudCannon, a Collection is a group of similar files stored in the same folder of your website (e.g., a folder of pages, blog posts, products, or data files). By adding a Collection to your CloudCannon Configuration File, you can access that Collection through a link in your *Site navigation* and

## Adding Collections using Dev Mode

When you created your CloudCannon Configuration File in the previous step, CloudCannon turned on Dev Mode. When Dev Mode is on, CloudCannon will show a purple button next to things you can configure in the app. One of these is the *\+ Add Collections* button in the *Site navigation.*

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If you need to add more Collections to your Site in the future, the *\+Add Collections* button will appear in the *Site navigation* whenever you turn on Dev Mode.
</comp.Notice>

Click on the *\+ Add Collections* button. CloudCannon will open the *Add Collections* modal.

There are two ways to add Collections to your Site. CloudCannon will detect potential Collections in your website files. You can choose any number of these detected Collections, or create a custom Collection by manually entering a few initial details.

Regardless of your chosen method, CloudCannon will convert your answers to YAML and add them to your Configuration File under the `collections_config` key. You can expand the *Additional content for`/cloudcannon.config.yml`* dropdown at the bottom of the *Add Collections* modal to see the content CloudCannon will add to your file.

### Choose from detected Collections

Choosing from the Collections detected by CloudCannon is the easiest method for adding Collections. To use this method, ensure the *Choose from detected Collections* radio button is enabled.

When CloudCannon detects Collections in your Site files, there are four details to review: the Collection name, path, icon, and files.

For each Collection, CloudCannon will

  **What Collection does a file belong to?**

  Files will appear in the Collection with the most specific Collection path. Let's walk through an example.

  <comp.DocsImage path="" alt="hish" title=""/>

  Assume you have an `authors` folder nested in your `blog` folder (i.e., `/blog/authors/`). The `authors` folder contains non-output data files with profile information about your various blog authors. In addition to the `authors` folder, the `blog` folder also contains all your output blog files. In this case, both the `authors` and `blog` folders could be Collections.

  If you only define the "Blog" Collection with the path `/blog/`, all your output blog files will belong to this Collection, but so will all the data files inside `/blog/authors/`. All these files will appear in your Blog *Collection browser*. Defining the "Blog" Collection and the "Authors" Collection will separate these files, keeping your output blog files in one *Collection browser* and your non-output data files in another.

checkbox

When you are happy with your selection, click the *\+ Add Collections* button at the bottom of the modal.

### Create a custom Collection

Adding a custom Collection manually allows you to specify the configuration details, which is helpful if you have a specific setup in mind that isn't covered by the Collections CloudCannon automatically detected. To use this method, click the *Create a custom Collection* radio button.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

There are lots of details you can define for each Collection, which we'll cover in further detail in the optional [configure your Collections](/documentation/guides/getting-started/configure-your-collections/) step of this guide. To start with, we'll give each Collection a key, path, name, and icon.

When you are happy with your configuration, click the *\+ Add Collection* button at the bottom of the modal.
