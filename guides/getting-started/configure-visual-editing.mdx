## Visual Editor Previews

In a previous section of this guide, we talked about the Visual Editor — an intuitive way to edit your site by clicking directly on a preview of your page. But how do you make each region editable in the Visual Editor?

### Bookshop

<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop/">Bookshop</a> is our open-source tool to automate maintaining page components for page building. Using Bookshop, your team can update the front matter of each page component in the Visual Editor. CloudCannon will re-render your page as changes occur, generating a preview of your page as you edit.

To get started with Bookshop, read our <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/guides/bookshop-astro-guide/">Astro Bookshop guide</a>, or <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/support/">reach out to our support team</a>.

## Bookshop

A common feature of modern website builders is the ability to add and move content blocks to build custom page layouts from defined components. We’ve created <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop">Bookshop</a> to automate maintaining page components for page building. Bookshop is an open-source component library compatible with Astro, Eleventy, Hugo, Jekyll, and SvelteKit. It’s simple to introduce and has tight integration into CloudCannon, which will handle most of the setup.

To get started with Bookshop, read our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop/">Bookshop guide</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/support/">reach out to our support team</a>.

## Visual Editor Previews

In a previous section of this guide, we talked about the Visual Editor — an intuitive way to edit your site by clicking directly on a preview of your page. But how do you make each region editable in the Visual Editor?

### React Connector

The <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/react-connector">React Connector</a> is our open-source tool which listens for live editing events in the Visual Editor. CloudCannon will re-render your page as changes occur, generating a preview of your page as you edit.

CloudCannon React Connector is available on npm. To install it, run the following terminal command:

<comp.CodeBlock language="" source="">
    ```
        npm i @cloudcannon/react-connector
    ```
    </comp.CodeBlock>

Update the code in `pages/_app.jsx` from:

<comp.CodeBlock language="JavaScript" source="">
    ```
        export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
        	return <Component {...pageProps} />
        }
        ```
        </comp.CodeBlock>

        to:

        <comp.CodeBlock language="JavaScript" source="">
        ```
        import { CloudCannonConnect } from '@cloudcannon/react-connector'

        export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
        	const AppComponent = CloudCannonConnect(Component);
        	return <AppComponent {...pageProps}/>
        }
    ```
    </comp.CodeBlock>

CloudCannon will now push changes made to front matter in the Visual Editor directly into page props. This will display the new values in the Visual Editor immediately.

For more react connector options, read our <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/react-connector">GitHub React Connector guide</a>, or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/support/">reach out to our support team</a>.

## Visual Editor Previews

In a previous section of this guide, we talked about the Visual Editor — an intuitive way to edit your site by clicking directly on a preview of your page. But how do you make each region editable in the Visual Editor?

### Editable class

To edit HTML in the Visual Editor, add the class ‘editable’ to HTML elements. This way, you can give as much or as little access to your content team as you need.

You can define add the ‘editable’ class to your site in the Source Editor:

<comp.CodeBlock language="HTML" source="homepage.html">
    ```
        <p class="editable">I'm editable in the visual editor</p>
        <p>I'm <strong>not</strong> editable in the visual editior</p>
    ```
    </comp.CodeBlock>

The element you apply the ‘editable’ class to will change the editing options in the WYSIWYG toolbar. For example, adding the editable class to an &lt;h1&gt; element will provide basic text formatting options. Adding it to a &lt;div&gt; element will open the option to add images, lists, and tables. You can [customize the WYSIWYG toolbar](/documentation/articles/configuring-toolbars) to have complete control over what editors can and cannot add to each element.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Changes made to the HTML save back to your layout, which might affect multiple content files.
</comp.Notice>
