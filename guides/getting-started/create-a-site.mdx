The features on a Site are likely why you are looking for a CMS in the first place. Sites allow you to:

* See all your files in user-friendly editing interfaces.
* Organize files to create a more intuitive experience for your content creators.
* Create processes for saving changes to your content
* Track the who, when, and why for each change to your website

## Git providers

When you create a Site, CloudCannon first needs to sync your website files from their current location. This could be your local computer storage, or a Git repository maintained using one of CloudCannon's supported Git providers: <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-github-repository-as-your-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-gitlab-respository-as-your-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitLab</a>, or <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-bitbucket-respository-as-your-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitbucket</a>.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  We highly recommend using a Git provider for better security, version control, and collaboration.
</comp.Notice>

This guide will cover how to create a Site from files stored in a Git repository.

## Create your first Site

Creating your first Site is a key step in getting started on CloudCannon. Let's walk through how to authenticate your Git provider, select a repository and branch, name your Site, and sync your files.

If you already have a Site and are using this guide to create another, most of the instructions will be the same; however, some pages or UI may appear differently.

To create a new Site, click on...

CloudCannon will open the *Create your first Site* page. This page will show the option to sync your own Site files from their existing location, or to start with one of our website templates.

Click the *Use your own files* card.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If you already have one or more Sites associated with your Organization, clicking the *Sites* button in the *App sidebar* will open the *Sites browser*. You can add a new Site to CloudCannon using the *\+ Create a Site* button at the top right of the *Sites browser*.

  <comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/syncing/create-a-new-site/2024-11/CloudCannon-Documentation-Sites-Page.png" alt="A screenshot of the Sites browser shows a list of existing Sites and a button to Create a Site." title="The Sites browser" type="screenshot"/>
</comp.Notice>

CloudCannon will open the *Create a Site* page. Here, you can use the *File source* dropdown to select your Git provider.

### Authenticate your Git provider

If you have already authenticated your Git provider

If this is your first time using CloudCannon, you must give CloudCannon permission to access your Git provider.

Select your Git provider using the *File source* dropdown, then click the *Authenticate* button. CloudCannon will forward you to your Git provider login screen.

### Select your repository and branch

After confirming your Git provider, the *Repository* dropdown will list all the available repositories on your account. Select your Site repository.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/syncing/create-a-new-site/2024-11/CloudCannon-Documentation-Create-a-Site-Repository.png" alt="A screenshot of the Create a Site page shows the Repository select field to search for repositories associated with your Git provider." title="The Create a Site page" type="screenshot"/>

As a Git-based CMS, CloudCannon uses branches for better version control and to enable you to work on updates to your Site in parallel.

Use the *Branch setup* radio buttons to select either *Use an existing branch* or *Create a new branch*. You will most likely want to use an existing branch, but if you want to try CloudCannon without impacting your existing work, you can create a new one.

If you select *Use an existing branch*, use the *Branch* dropdown to select a branch from your repository.

If you select *Create a new branch*, use the *Source branch* dropdown to select a branch from your repository to copy and enter a name in the *new branch name* field.

### Name your Site

Use the *Site name* field to add a name for your Site. This affects what CloudCannon calls your Site and doesn't affect your repository in your Git provider.

CloudCannon will automatically populate this field with the same name as your repository, but you can choose any name for your Site.

Click the *Create site and start syncing* button at the bottom of the page.

### CloudCannon will sync your files

CloudCannon will begin syncing your files from your Git provider. This process is usually quick, but it may take a few minutes for larger repositories.

&nbsp;

## A tour of your Site!

The *Sites browser* page lists all the Sites in your Organization, and includes filtering and sorting options to help you find specific Sites. You can access the *Sites browser* at any time by clicking the *Sites* button in your *App sidebar*.

In the next step of this guide, we'll cover...
