A Site is where you see, edit, and review all your website files. Sites are core to your CloudCannon experience and are where you and your content teams will spend the majority of your time.

The features on a Site are likely why you are looking for a CMS in the first place. Sites allow you to:

* See all your files in user-friendly editing interfaces.
* Organize files to create a more intuitive experience for your content creators.
* Create processes for saving changes to your content.
* Track the who, when, and why for each change to your website.

In this step of the guide, we'll create your first Site by syncing your website files to CloudCannon and point out important UI during a tour of your Site.

## Using a Git provider

When you create a Site, CloudCannon first needs to sync your website files from their current location. This could be your local computer storage, or a Git repository maintained using one of CloudCannon's supported Git providers: <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-github-repository-as-your-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-gitlab-respository-as-your-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitLab</a>, or <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-bitbucket-respository-as-your-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitbucket</a>.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  We highly recommend using a Git provider for better security, version control, and collaboration.
</comp.Notice>

This guide will cover how to create a Site from files stored in a Git repository.

## Create your first Site

Creating your first Site is a key step in getting started on CloudCannon. Let's walk through how to authenticate your Git provider, select a repository and branch, name your Site, and sync your files. If you already have a Site and are using this guide to create another, most of the instructions will be the same; however, some pages or UI may look different.

In the previous step of this guide, we introduced you to your *Organization Home* page. To create a new Site, click the *Create a Site* button in the *Setting up your Organization* task list or the *Sites* button in your *App Sidebar*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Organization-Home-No-Sites" alt="A screenshot of the Organization Dashboard shows the Setting up your Organization task list." title="The Organization Home page" type="screenshot"/>

CloudCannon will open the *Create your first Site* page. This page will show the option to sync your Site files from their existing location or start with one of our website templates.

Click the *Use your own files* card.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Sites-Browser-No-Sites" alt="A screenshot of the Sites browser shows the option to create your first Site using your own files or a template." title="The Sites Browser with no Sites" type="screenshot"/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If you already have one or more Sites associated with your Organization, clicking the *Sites* button in the *App sidebar* will open the *Sites browser*. You can add a new Site to CloudCannon using the *\+ Create a Site* button at the top right of the *Sites browser*.

  <comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/syncing/create-a-new-site/2024-11/CloudCannon-Documentation-Sites-Page.png" alt="A screenshot of the Sites browser shows a list of existing Sites and a button to Create a Site." title="The Sites browser" type="screenshot"/>
</comp.Notice>

CloudCannon will open the *Create a Site* page. Here, you can use the *File source* dropdown to select your Git provider.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Create-a-Site-Source-Dropdown" alt="A screenshot of the Create a Site page shows a dropdown to select your File Source from a Git repository, local storage, or template." title="The Create a Site page" type="screenshot"/>

### Authenticate your Git provider

If you have already authenticated your Git provider, you can skip this section.

If this is your first time using CloudCannon, you must give CloudCannon permission to access your Git provider. You can see which Git providers are authenticated by a green tick icon next to the option in the *File source* dropdown.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

When you select an unauthenticated Git provider using the *File source* dropdown, CloudCannon will show you the *Authenticate* button.

Click this button and CloudCannon will forward you to your Git provider login screen. Follow your Git provider's instructions to authenticate access, then return to the *Create a Site* page on CloudCannon.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Create-a-Site-Authenticate-GitHub" alt="A screenshot of the Create a Site page shows an Authenticate button to approve CloudCannon's access to GitHub." title="The Create a Site page" type="screenshot"/>

You only need to authenticate your Git provider once; CloudCannon will remember for all other Sites you create.

### Select your repository and branch

Once you have selected an authenticated Git provider using the *File source* dropdown, the *Create a Site* page will show a *Repository* dropdown and *Branch Setup* section. The *Repository* dropdown will list all the available repositories from your authenticated Git provider account.

Select the correct repository from the list. You can type in the *Repository* text field to filter your options, if necessary.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

As a Git-based CMS, CloudCannon uses branching for better security, version control, and to enable you and your team to work on updates to your website in parallel. Each Site on CloudCannon is connected to a branch of your Git repository. If you need a refresher on Git workflows, including how they apply to CloudCannon, please read **our documentation on X**.

Use the *Branch setup* radio buttons to select either *Use an existing branch* or *Create a new branch*. You will most likely want to use an existing branch, but if you want to try CloudCannon without impacting your existing work, you can create a new one.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

If you select *Use an existing branch*, use the *Branch* dropdown to select a branch from your repository.

If you select *Create a new branch*, use the *Source branch* dropdown to select which branch from your repository to copy and enter a name for your new branch in the *New branch name* text field.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

### Name your Site

The *Site name* text field determines the name for your Site in CloudCannon. This won't affect your repository or branch in your Git provider.

CloudCannon will automatically populate this field with the name of your repository, but you can choose any name for your Site. We recommend choosing a simple name that provides information about the purpose of the Site (e.g., "CloudCannon Marketing Website", "Production: CloudCannon Documentation", "Staging: CloudCannon Documentation").

Use the *Site name* field to add a name for your Site.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

Click the *Create Site and start syncing* button at the bottom of the page.

### CloudCannon will sync your files

CloudCannon will begin syncing your files from your Git provider. This process is usually quick, but it may take a few minutes for larger repositories. Once CloudCannon has finished syncing, it will open your *Site Dashboard*!

Let's take a tour of your new Site and point out some important UI. If you would rather continue configuring CloudCannon, feel free to skip straight to the next step in this guide.

## A tour of your new Site

Your *Site Dashboard* is the homepage for your Site. At this stage, your Site might look a little empty. Don't worry, we'll walk through how to configure each element, allowing you to craft an experience that works best for you and your team.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

On the left, you can see the *App sidebar* in blue. This is the same as in the previous step of this guide (when we showed you the *Organization Home* page). If you ever navigate away from your Site and need to find it again, click the *Sites* button in your *App sidebar* to open your *Sites browser*. This page will list all the Sites in your Organization, and includes filtering and sorting options to help you find specific Sites.

At the top of your screen is the *Site header* in gray. This section displays key information about your Site in the top left, such as your Site icon, name, and branch, and important tools in the top right, such as the *Avatars* of all the team members viewing a Site, the *Dev Mode* switch, and the *Save* button. We'll go through what all these tools do in the later steps of this guide.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

On the left of your screen, just in from the *App sidebar*, is your *Site navigation* in gray. For now, your *Site navigation* will just have a link to your *Dashboard* at the top, and two *Developer* links at the bottom for your *File browser* and *Site Settings*. Once we have configured your Site further, more links will appear in the *Site navigation*.

Try clicking the link to your *File browser*. As you can see, CloudCannon has synced all your files from your Git repository.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

When you are ready to return to your *Dashboard*, click the *Dashboard* link in your *Site navigation*. You can always tell which page of your are on by which link is highlighted in the *Site navigation*.

Finally, the majority of your screen is your Site *Dashboard* page, which acts as a hub for key information about your Site. The *Dashboard* is broken down into several tabs, including *Summary*, *Activity*, and *Syncs*. You can click on these tabs to navigate between them.

Depending on your later configuration, the *Dashboard* may also have *Builds* and *Usage* tabs. We'll cover this later in the guide.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

On the *Summary* tab of your *Dashboard*, CloudCannon will display summary information about your Site. For new Sites, CloudCannon will generate a *Getting started* task list with suggested steps for configuring your Site (just like the *Setting up your Organization* task list we encountered in the previous step). On the right, it also gives a preview of recent activity and syncs on your Site.

On the *Activity* tab of your *Dashboard*, CloudCannon will show you a list of recent activity on your Site in reverse chronological order. This list includes:

* Every change made to your files from within CloudCannon or your Git provider (including the author, date, time, and commit message, if applicable).
* When your Site has&nbsp;Syncing or Output errors.
* Any changes made to your *Site Settings*, or *Branch* and *Publish Branch* settings.

This list refreshes every time you sync your Site or update your *Site Settings*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

On the *Syncs* tab of your *Dashboard*, CloudCannon will show you a list syncing logs for your Site in reverse chronological order.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

Here's an example of what your *Site Dashboard* could look like after configuration.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

In the next step of this guide, we'll start working on the *Getting started* task list for your Site, including creating your CloudCannon Configuration File.
