description: Learn about Organizations on CloudCannon and how to set up yours.
---
After you create your account, CloudCannon will open your *Organization Home* page.

Organizations are the highest level of content management on CloudCannon. When you sign up, CloudCannon will automatically create an Organization for you. You can also join other people's Organizations by invitation, allowing you to manage their content. An Organization can contain many team members, sites, projects, and domains.

To help you get started on CloudCannon, the *Organization Home* page shows a task list for *Setting up your Organization*. These tasks provide you with a list of goals for optimally setting up CloudCannon.

We'll cover the first few tasks in this guide: *Create a Site*, *Authenticate with a Git provider*, and *Create a Site from a Git repository*. The remaining optional Organization tasks are covered in other guides.

Each task has a heading, description, and documentation link.

  **A quick note about Documentation...**

  CloudCannon links to helpful documentation in multiple places throughout the App. When you see the open book symbol next to a link, or on its own next to a title, clicking on it will open the relevant page on the CloudCannon Documentation website in a modal.

On the left of the *Organization Home* page is the *App sidebar* in blue.

The *App sidebar* helps you navigate your Organization, with buttons for your *Home*, *Sites*, *Projects*, *Domains*, and *Org Settings* at the top. If you need to return to the *Organization Home* page at any time, click the *Home* button.

At the bottom of the *App sidebar* are the *Updates* button and your account *Avatar* at the bottom. Clicking on the *Updates* button will open the *App Updates* modal, with a list of CloudCannon's most recent changelogs. You can find a link to your *Account Settings* and *Support* by clicking on your *Avatar*, as well as navigate to other *Organizations* (if you are a member of multiple Orgs).

Now that you are more acquainted with your Organization, let's add some content to it!

In the next step of this guide, we'll start create a Site from our website Git repository and sync our files to CloudCannon.
