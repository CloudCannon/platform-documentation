After you create your Site, CloudCannon will generate a *Getting started* task list with suggested steps for configuring it. The first step is to *Add your files*, which we did in the last step of this guide. CloudCannon will have already marked this task as completed for you.

The next step is to *Create your CloudCannon Configuration File*.

The CloudCannon Configuration File is the heart of your CloudCannon experience, allowing you to customize the functionality and appearance of your Site. Adding formatted content to your Configuration File lets you configure your *Site Navigation*, Editing Interfaces, file appearance in the app, how CloudCannon adds new files, and more.

As we go through the later steps of this guide, we'll add to our Configuration File a lot. Let's create one.

## Initial content for the CloudCannon Configuration File

Click the *Create my Configuration File* button in your task list under the *Create your CloudCannon Configuration File* task. CloudCannon will open the *Create my Configuration File* modal.

The CloudCannon Configuration File is stored at the root of your website directory by default and can be YAML or JSON. The *Getting started* task list will create `/cloudcannon.config.yml` for you.

To create the file's initial content, CloudCannon needs you to define your Static Site Generator (SSG) and Source Folder.

An SSG is a tool for generating a static HTML website from your files. CloudCannon supports various SSGs, from Astro, Eleventy, and Hugo to Jekyll, MkDocs, and Lume. You can choose whichever SSG works for you.

CloudCannon will use the information found in your files to suggest an SSG. You can click on the suggested SSG to select it, or use an option from the *Static Site Generator* dropdown.

The Source Folder defines the base path for your SSG source files relative to the root of your directory. If the root of your directory is your Source Folder, you can leave the *Source Folder* text field blank. However, if your source folder is nested in your repository (such as if you have a mono-repo), you should enter the file path for your nested Source Folder.

At the bottom of the *Create my Configuration File* modal, you will see a dropdown called *Initial content for`/cloudcannon.config.yml`*. If you are interested in the format of your Configuration File, you can expand this to see the content CloudCannon will add to the file. This content is based on your answers to the above questions and converted to YAML.

Click the *Create my Configuration File* button at the bottom of the modal. CloudCannon will add `cloudcannon.config.yml` to the root of your repository.

Congratulations! You've made your first change to your website content: adding a file. You might notice that the *Save* button in the top right now has a red "1" notification. This indicates that you have made a change to one file. Don't click the Save button just yetâ€”we'll talk about saving changes to your Site in the [editing files and saving changes](/documentation/guides/getting-started/editing-files-and-saving-changes/) step of this guide.

Another thing you might notice is a purple *Configuration Mode* switch at the top right of the app. Other purple buttons and UI have appeared on your Site, too. CloudCannon has turned Configuration Mode on in preparation for the next step in setting up your Site.

Configuration Mode allows you to configure various elements of your Site and add that configuration to your CloudCannon Configuration File. We'll discuss Configuration Mode more in the [add your Collections](/documentation/guides/getting-started/add-your-collections/) and [check out Configuration Mode](/documentation/guides/getting-started/check-out-dev-mode/) steps of this guide.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

Now that we have a Configuration File, we can start defining our preferences and settings to customize our Site. Let's start by creating a user-friendly interface for our files, called a *Collection Browser*.

In the next step of this guide, we'll cover Collections, including what they are and how to add them to your *Site Navigation* using your CloudCannon Configuration File.
