supports editing of what file types

## The *Collection Browser*

x

At the top right of each file Card (or the right if you are using *List* view) is an icon containing six dots. This is the *Drag* handle and the file *Context Menu*.

Clicking and holding the *Drag* handle allows you to move a file Card around the screen, including moving it into nested folders in your Collection.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

Clicking on the *Context Menu* will open a dropdown containing important file actions, including:

* *Open URL* —
* *Copy URL* —
* *Open with* —
* *Open Source Folder* —
* *Copy Source Path* —
* *Move to new folder* —
* *Move up a folder* —
* *Duplicate* —
* *Rename* —
* *Delete* —
* *Publish to posts* (Jekyll only) —

If the file has unsaved changes, the *Context Menu* will also contain the following options:

* *View diff* —
* *Discard unsaved changes* —

## CloudCannon's Editing Interfaces

When you click on a file in your *Collection Browser*, CloudCannon will open it in one of four Editing Interfaces: the Visual Editor, Content Editor, Data Editor, or Source Editor. Which Editing Interface CloudCannon uses will depend on the file type and any defaults you have configured for your Collection (we'll return to default Editing Interfaces in [Configure your Collections](/documentation/guides/getting-started/configure-your-collections/)). Each interface provides a different editing experience and tools specific to particular file types.

Let's take a look at each Editing Interface, including how to edit your files in each of them. You can follow along by opening the *Collection Browser* for one of your Collections, then clicking on any file to open it in an Editing Interface.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

When you first open an Editing Interface

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### The *Editing Interface Header*

The *Editing interface Header* is at the top of every Editing Interface. It contains important tools for navigating your Editing Interface and Site.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

The *Editing Interface Header* has a *Return to Site* button on the left. You can click this button to go back to your *Collection Browser*. Next, it has the Collection icon, the file name, and the file path.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

Next is the *Update Status* indicator. This shows you when a file was last updated, and briefly displays the *Updating...* status whenever you edit your file. While CloudCannon is updating your file, we recommend that you don't switch Editing Interfaces or refresh your page.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

Every team member in your Organization has an *Avatar* (we'll cover this more in the [Add your team to CloudCannon](/documentation/guides/getting-started/add-your-team-to-cloudcannon/) step of this guide). The *Avatars* of team members who are currently viewing a file appear in the *Editing Interface Header*. The person currently editing a file will have a green outline and pencil icon next to their *Avatar*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

The *Switch Editing Interface* buttons allow you to easily change which Editing Interface your file is open in: the Visual, Content, Data, and Source Editors. Depending on the type of file you have open, how your collections are configured, and what permissions you have, the Switch Editing Interface buttons will show between two and four options.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

Up next is the *Context Menu*. Clicking on the *Context Menu* icon (three vertical dots) opens a dropdown with important file actions.

This menu is similar to the *Context Menu* in the *Collection Browser*, with the *Open URL*, *Copy URL*, *Open Source Folder*, *Copy Source Path*, *Move to new folder*, *Duplicate*, *Rename*, *Delete*, *Publish to posts* (Jekyll only), *View diff*, and *Discard unsaved changes* options.

Instead of the *Open with* option, the Editing Interface *Context Menu* contains the *Open recent* option.

* *Open recent* —

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

The *Information* button opens our *Editing help* modal.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

Finally, the *Dev Mode* switch and the *Save* button are on the far right of the *Editing Interface Header*. These UI elements are in the same place on your *Site Header*, so you always know where to find them.

The *Save* button allows you to save your changes to all edited files. A red notification icon will indicate how many files have unsaved changes. We'll talk about saving your changes more later in this step of the guide.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

### The Visual Editor

x

We'll dive deeper into the Visual Editor in the [Configure visual editing](/documentation/guides/getting-started/configure-visual-editing/) step of this guide.

### The Content Editor

The Content Editor is a rich text editor for clean, distraction-free editing of content-heavy files. This editing interface is most useful for Markdown and MDX files, with or without front matter.

The Content Editor is a WYSIWYG editor, meaning that the way you format the content in the editor will resemble the way it will look on your website page (WYSIWYG is an acronym for What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get).

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

The majority of the Content Editor is the content area. You can add, edit, or delete content in your file by clicking the content area and typing as you would with other rich text editors, like Google Docs or Microsoft Word.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

At the top of the editing interface, just under the *Editing Interface Header*, is a WYSIWYG toolbar. This toolbar is populated with tools to help you format your content. This might include adding images, links, and lists, changing the alignment of your text, or simple tools such as bolding, italicizing, or underlining text.

To use these tools, click to place your cursor in the content area (or, in some cases, highlight your existing text) and then click the icon for the tool you want to use. The number of tools available in your *WSYIWYG toolbar* will depend on how your site is configured.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

The Content Editor sidebar is on the left of the editing interface. It is used to edit structured data in the front matter of your markup file. Front matter fields contain data that does not appear in the main body of the content. You can open or close the sidebar using the arrow button on the right of the panel.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

Finally, the Content Editor allows you to add Snippets to your rich text content, enabling you to accomplish various tasks, such as adding a video link, a highlighted section of text, or a code block. Adding snippets to your content is a great way to build complex, rich text documents without the need for team members to touch the underlying code.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

### The Data Editor

The Data Editor allows you to manage structured data through Inputs. The Data Editor makes it easy to manage content in YAML, TOML, JSON, CSV, and TSV files.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

We have already seen a version of the Data Editor — the sidebar for managing front matter in the Visual and Content Editor!

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

### The Source Editor

The Source Editor is an in-browser code editor, great for making small, quick changes.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

## Saving your changes

Now that we have covered all the Editing Interfaces, let's edit one of your files! Try opening different file types, or switching between Editing Interfaces using the *Switch Editing Interface* buttons.

### Visual Editor

[The Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/the-visual-editor/) is the most intuitive way to edit content in CloudCannon, using an interactive preview of your site. You can navigate your pages as you would on your live site and edit directly onto the page. This Editing Interface works for any file that outputs to an HTML page on your site.

<comp.DocsVideo url="https://player.vimeo.com/progressive_redirect/playback/949770947/rendition/1080p/file.mp4?loc=external&signature=5b5c24abc0922a7e42e3aab8b728a7d25e67c546b59b5499453d19bf37cf71aa" title="Visual Editor with data bindings" autoplay={true} loop={true}/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Depending on your SSG and site configuration, you may not have access to the Visual Editor for all files.
</comp.Notice>

The Visual Editor uses the sidebar or Data Panels for managing front matter content, each with customizable inputs to give your editing team a more intuitive interface.

CloudCannon requires you to build your Site to use the Visual Editor. We'll cover how to build your Site later in this guide.
