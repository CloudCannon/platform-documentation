  Learn about editing files on your CloudCannon Site and saving those changes
  back to your Git repository.
---
Let's get to the main purpose of a CMS: content management.

You can edit several file types in CloudCannon, from structured data files like JSON and YAML, to Markup files like HTML, Markdown, and MDX. Each file type is useful for a different part of your Site.

Structured data files are a great way to store data for page-building components, navigation, header and footer, or site metadata. We recommend markup files with structured data in the front matter for blog posts, articles, or documentation.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Depending on the file extension, you may not be able to use CloudCannon's Visual, Content, or Data Editors to edit your file, but you can always use the Source Editor.
</comp.Notice>

You can edit the files on your Site in two ways. One, you can use file actions from the file *Context Menu* to apply changes to where and how a file is stored in your Site, or two, you can open a file in one of CloudCannon's four Editing Interfaces to update the content.

## File actions in the file *Context Menu*

When you look at the files in any *Collection Browser*, you can see a six-dot icon at the top right of each file Card (or the right if you use *List* view). This is the *Drag* handle and the file *Context Menu*.

<comp.DocsVideo url="" title="" autoplay={true} loop={true}/>

When you click and hold the icon, it acts as a *Drag* handle, allowing you to move a file Card around the screen, including into nested folders in your Collection.

When you click on the icon, it acts as the *Context Menu*, opening a dropdown containing important file actions. File actions include:

* *Open URL* — Open the live URL for an output file from your most recent build. This uses your Testing Domain.
* *Copy URL* — Copy the live URL for an output file from your most recent build. This uses your Testing Domain.
* *Open with* — Open a file in one of CloudCannon's Editing Interfaces.
* *Open Source Folder* — Open the location of a file in the File Browser.
* *Copy Source Path* — Copy the file path for a file, relative to your Site source folder.
* *Move to new folder* — Create a new folder within your Collection and move a file to that folder.
* *Move up a folder* — Move a file to the folder above it in your Collection. Note: This option is not available if the file is at the top level of a Collection.
* *Duplicate* — Duplicate a file, and choose between creating an exact copy or updating any instance values in the front matter. CloudCannon will add "-copy" to the end of the file name.
* *Rename* — Rename a file by creating a copy of your file with the updated name and marking the old file for deletion the next time you save changes to your Site.
* *Delete* — Mark a file for deletion the next time you save changes to your Site.
* *Publish to posts* (Jekyll only) — Move a file to the "Posts" Collection.

If the file has unsaved changes, the *Context Menu* will also contain the following file actions:

* *View diff* — Review unsaved changes for a file in text format, with deleted content highlighted in red and new content highlighted in green.
* *Discard unsaved changes* — Discard all unsaved changes to a file.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Context-Menu" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows the File Card Context Menu for an edited file." title="The File Card Context Menu" type="screenshot"/>

If you want to add a new file to a Collection, rather than edit an existing one, you can click the *\+ Add* button in the top right of your *Collection Browser*. The name of your Collection will affect what CloudCannon calls the option to add a file in the *\+ Add* button dropdown (e.g., *\+ Add Testimonial* in the "Testimonials" Collection). By default, CloudCannon will copy the layout of an existing file in your Collection.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls-Add-Menu-Dropdown" alt="A screenshot of the + Add menu in the Collection Browser shows a dropdown with options to add a new file or folder." title="The + Add menu" type="ui-snippet"/>

We'll dive into configuring how CloudCannon adds new files to a Collection in the [Configure your Collections](/documentation/guides/configure-your-collections/) guide.

## CloudCannon's Editing Interfaces

When you click on a file in your *Collection Browser*, CloudCannon will open it in one of four Editing Interfaces: the Visual Editor, Content Editor, Data Editor, or Source Editor. Which Editing Interface CloudCannon uses will depend on the file type and any defaults you have configured for your Collection (we'll return to default Editing Interfaces in [Configure your Collections](/documentation/guides/configure-your-collections/)). Each interface provides a different editing experience and tools specific to particular file types.

Let's take a look at each Editing Interface, including how to edit your files in each of them. You can follow along by opening the *Collection Browser* for one of your Collections, then clicking on any file to open it in an Editing Interface.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-File-Card-Gallery" alt="A screenshot of the File Card in the Collection Browser." title="A gallery File Card" type="ui-snippet"/>

### The *Editing Interface Header*

The *Editing interface Header* is at the top of every Editing Interface. It contains important tools for navigating your Editing Interface and Site.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Editing-Interface-Header" alt="A screenshot of the Editing Interface Header shows the Return to Site button, file details, and editing interface controls." title="The Editing Interface Header" type="ui-snippet"/>

The *Editing Interface Header* has a *Return to Site* button on the left. You can click this button to go back to your *Collection Browser*. Next, it has the Collection icon and the file name. If you choose to build your Site, the output URL will also appear here (we'll cover this more in [the next step of this guide](/documentation/guides/getting-started/choose-building-or-headless/)).

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Editing-Interface-Header-Return-Button-and-File-Details" alt="A screenshot of the Editing Interface Header shows the Return to Site button and the file details." title="The Editing Interface Header" type="ui-snippet"/>

The *Editing Interface Controls* are on the right of the *Editing Interface Header*. These include the *Update Status* indicator, the *Avatar* list, the *Switch Editing Interface* buttons, the *Context Menu*, the *Configuration Mode* switch, and the *Save* button.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Editing-Interface-Header-Controls" alt="A screenshot of the Editing Interface Controls shows several tools, including the Switch Editing Interface buttons and the Save button." title="The Editing Interface Controls" type="ui-snippet"/>

The first tool in your *Editing Interface Controls* is the *Update Status* indicator. This shows you when a file was last updated, and briefly displays the *Updating...* status whenever you edit your file. While CloudCannon is updating your file, we recommend that you don't switch Editing Interfaces or refresh your page.

Every team member in your Organization has an *Avatar* (we'll cover this more in the [Add your team to CloudCannon](/documentation/guides/add-your-team-to-cloudcannon/) guide). The *Avatar* list displays the avatars of team members who are currently viewing a file. The person currently editing a file will have a green outline and pencil icon next to their *Avatar*.

The *Switch Editing Interface* buttons allow you to easily change which Editing Interface your file is open in: the Visual, Content, Data, and Source Editors. Depending on the type of file you have open, how your collections are configured, and what permissions you have, the *Switch Editing Interface* buttons will show between two and four options. Right now, your Editing Interface will be missing the Visual Editor option, as we haven't configured Site building (we'll cover this more in [the next step of this guide](/documentation/guides/getting-started/choose-building-or-headless/)).

Up next is the *Context Menu*. Clicking on the *Context Menu* icon (three vertical dots) opens a dropdown with important file actions.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Content-Editor-Context-Menu" alt="A screenshot of the Content Editor shows the open Context Menu, containing file actions for editing your file." title="The Content Editor Context Menu" type="screenshot"/>

This menu is similar to the *Context Menu* in the *Collection Browser*, with the *Open URL*, *Copy URL*, *Open Source Folder*, *Copy Source Path*, *Move to new folder*, *Duplicate*, *Rename*, *Delete*, *Publish to posts* (Jekyll only), *View diff*, and *Discard unsaved changes* options.

Instead of the *Open with* option, the Editing Interface *Context Menu* contains the *Open recent* option.

* *Open recent* — View and navigate to one of the five most recent files you have opened in an editing interface.

Finally, the *Configuration Mode* switch and the *Save* button are on the far right of the *Editing Interface Header*. These UI elements are in the same place on your *Site Header*, so you always know where to find them.

The *Save* button allows you to save your changes to all edited files. A red notification icon will indicate how many files have unsaved changes. We'll talk about saving your changes more later in this step of the guide.

### The Visual Editor

The Visual Editor is the most intuitive way to edit content in CloudCannon, using an interactive preview of your Site. You can navigate your pages as you would on your live Site and edit directly on the page. This Editing Interface works for any file that outputs to an HTML page on your site.

<comp.DocsVideo url="https://player.vimeo.com/progressive_redirect/playback/949770947/rendition/1080p/file.mp4?loc=external&signature=5b5c24abc0922a7e42e3aab8b728a7d25e67c546b59b5499453d19bf37cf71aa" title="Visual Editor with data bindings" autoplay={true} loop={true}/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Depending on your SSG and site configuration, you may not have access to the Visual Editor for all files.
</comp.Notice>

When you open an output file in the Visual Editor, CloudCannon will show you a preview of the live webpage generated during your last Site build. You can edit directly on the page. Depending on how your developer has configured visual editing for your Site, this can range from simple changes like updating text or images to reordering content blocks.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

When you edit rich text in the Visual Editor, CloudCannon will provide a WYSIWYG toolbar with tools to help you format your content.

The Visual Editor sidebar is on the left of the editing interface. It is used to edit structured data in the front matter of your markup file. You can open or close the sidebar using the arrow button on the right of the panel.

However, access to the Visual Editor on CloudCannon depends on a few factors: configuring builds for your Site and adding CloudCannon Editables to your files. We'll cover Site builds in the [next step of this guide](/documentation/guides/getting-started/choose-building-or-headless), and dive deeper into the Visual Editor in the [Configure visual editing](/documentation/guides/configure-visual-editing/) guide.

### The Content Editor

The Content Editor is a rich text editor for clean, distraction-free editing of content-heavy files. This editing interface is most useful for Markdown and MDX files, with or without front matter.

The Content Editor is a WYSIWYG editor, meaning that the way you format the content in the editor will resemble the way it will look on your website page (WYSIWYG is an acronym for What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get).

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Content-Editor" alt="A screenshot of the Content Editor shows a content area and WYSIWYG toolbar for editing rich text, and the sidebar for structured data." title="The Content Editor" type="screenshot"/>

The majority of the Content Editor is the content area. You can add, edit, or delete content in your file by clicking the content area and typing as you would with other rich text editors, like Google Docs or Microsoft Word.

At the top of the editing interface, just under the *Editing Interface Header*, is a WYSIWYG toolbar. This toolbar is populated with tools to help you format your content. This might include adding images, links, and lists, changing the alignment of your text, or simple tools such as bolding, italicizing, or underlining text.

To use these tools, click to place your cursor in the content area (or, in some cases, highlight your existing text) and then click the icon for the tool you want to use. The number of tools available in your *WSYIWYG toolbar* will depend on how your Site is configured.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Content-Editor-WYSIWYG-Toolbar" alt="A screenshot of the WYSIWYG Toolbar in the Content Editor shows several formatting tools for rich text." title="The WYSIWYG Toolbar" type="ui-snippet"/>

Just like the Visual Editor, the Content Editor has a *sidebar* on the left of the editing interface, containing Inputs for editing structured data in the front matter of your markup file. Front matter fields contain data that does not appear in the main body of the content. You can open or close the sidebar using the arrow button on the right of the panel.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-CloudCannon-Documentation-Content-Editor-Sidebar" alt="A screenshot of the Content Editor sidebar shows several Inputs for editing structured data in a file." title="The Content Editor sidebar" type="ui-snippet"/>

Finally, the Content Editor allows you to add Snippets to your rich text content, enabling you to accomplish various tasks, such as adding a video link, a highlighted section of text, or a code block. Adding Snippets to your content is a great way to build complex, rich text documents without the need for team members to touch the underlying code.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Content-Editor-Snippet" alt="A screenshot of a Snippet block in the Content Editor shows an Edit and Remove button." title="A block Snippet" type="ui-snippet"/>

We'll dive deeper into the WYSIWYG toolbar and Snippets in the [Configure your rich text editors](/documentation/guides/configure-your-rich-text-editors/) guide, and Inputs in the *Content Editor sidebar* in the [Configure your editing interfaces](/documentation/guides/configure-your-editing-interfaces/) guide.

### The Data Editor

The Data Editor allows you to manage structured data through Inputs. Each Input in the Data Editor corresponds to a key in your front matter or data file, providing an editing interface for those values.

For example, you could use the Data Editor to edit:

* Array inputs in your site navigation file, updating the URLs of the pages you want to list.
* Image inputs in the front matter of your blog post, updating the thumbnail image.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Data-Editor" alt="A screenshot of the Data Editor shows several Inputs for editing structured data in a markup file or data file." title="The Data Editor" type="screenshot"/>

The Data Editor makes it easy to manage content in YAML, TOML, JSON, CSV, and TSV files, as well as the front matter section of Markdown or MDX files. In fact, we have already seen a version of the Data Editor — it doubles as the sidebar and data panels in the Visual and Content Editor!

We'll dive deeper into Inputs in the [Configure your editing interfaces](/documentation/guides/getting-started/configure-your-editing-interfaces) step of this guide.

### The Source Editor

The Source Editor is an in-browser code editor, great for making small, quick changes. It displays the raw content of text-based files and utilizes syntax highlighting based on the file extension. This is similar to a developer's local development environment, if simplified.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

As the Source Editor allows you to edit the raw text content of a file, we recommend that non-technical team members avoid this Editing Interface. We'll cover team member permissions later in the [Add your team to CloudCannon](/documentation/guides/add-your-team-to-cloudcannon/) guide.

## Saving your changes

Now that we have covered all the Editing Interfaces, let's edit one of your files! Try opening different file types, or switching between Editing Interfaces using the *Switch Editing Interface* buttons.

Make a few changes. You'll see the red notification on the *Save* button update depending on how many files have unsaved changes.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

When you are ready to commit your changes back to your Git repository, click the *Save* button in the top right of the *Site Header* or *Editing Interface Header*. CloudCannon will open the *Save changes* modal.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

The *Save changes* modal allows you to review a summary of all unsaved changes on a Site.

The *Context Menu* for each file in the *Save changes* modal contains a reduced set of file actions: *Open URL*, *Copy URL*, open with the *Visual Editor*, *Content Editor*, *Data Editor*, or *Source Editor*, *View diff*, and *Discard unsaved changes*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

If you have multiple people working on the same Site, the *Save changes* modal will separate the files into the *My changes* and *Other changes* sections. By default, only files where you have contributed to the unsaved changes are selected, but you can save changes made by your team members if you need to.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

At the top left of each file Card is a checkbox, which controls whether the *Save* button will save changes to that file back to your Git repository. If you don't want to save changes to a particular file, you can untick the checkbox.

Use the checkboxes to select the files you want to save your changes. For the sake of this guide, please ensure you have saved your CloudCannon Configuration File.

When you are happy with your selection, click the *Save all* or *Save selected* button. CloudCannon will commit the selected changes to your Git repository!

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  We recommend saving the changes to your Site often, as this keeps your Git repository up to date.
</comp.Notice>

In the next step of this guide, we'll cover building, including what a Site build is, whether you need one, and how to switch between Building Mode and Headless Mode.
