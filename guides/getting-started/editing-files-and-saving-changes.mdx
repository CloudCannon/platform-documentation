## Editing interfaces

CloudCannon has four editing interfaces: the Visual Editor, Content Editor, Data Editor, and Source Editor. Each interface provides a different editing experience, with tools specific to particular file types.

Later in this guide we'll dive deeper into how to configure each editing interface.

### Visual Editor

[The Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/the-visual-editor/) is the most intuitive way to edit content in CloudCannon, using an interactive preview of your site. You can navigate your pages as you would on your live site and edit directly onto the page. This editing interface works for any file that outputs to an HTML page on your site.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Depending on your SSG and site configuration, you may not have access to the Visual Editor for all files.
</comp.Notice>

The Visual Editor uses the sidebar or Data Panels for managing front matter content, each with customizable inputs to give your editing team a more intuitive interface.

CloudCannon requires you to build your Site to use the Visual Editor. We'll cover how to build your Site later in this guide.

### Content Editor

[The Content Editor](/documentation/articles/the-content-editor/) is a rich text editor for markup files. This editor is useful if you want a distraction-free, clean writing interface, particularly for blog posts and other content with a simple layout. You can configure the WYSIWYG toolbar for your Content Editor to ensure you have all the tools you need and edit structured data in the front matter of your markup files using the sidebar.

### Data Editor

We have already seen the [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/the-data-editor/) â€” the sidebar for managing front matter in the Visual and Content Editor. The Data Editor also manages content in YAML, TOML, JSON, CSV, and TSV files. The Data Editor uses inputs to provide an editing interface for structure data in your files.

### Source Editor

[The Source Editor](/documentation/articles/the-source-editor/) is an in-browser code editor, great for making small, quick changes. As with all the editing interfaces, any changes sync back to your Git repository.
