## The *Collection Browser*

x

At the top right of each file Card (or the right if you are using *List* view) is an icon containing six dots. This is the *Drag* handle and the file *Context Menu*.

Clicking and holding the *Drag* handle allows you to move a file Card around the screen, including moving it into nested folders in your Collection.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

Clicking on the *Context Menu* will open a dropdown containing important file actions, including:

* *Open URL* —
* *Copy URL* —
* *Open with* —
* *Open Source Folder* —
* *Copy Source Path* —
* *Move to new folder* —
* *Move up a folder* —
* *Duplicate* —
* *Rename* —
* *Delete* —
* *Publish to posts* (Jekyll only) —

If the file has unsaved changes, the *Context Menu* will also contain the following options:

* *View diff* —
* *Discard unsaved changes* —

&nbsp;

Up next is the *Context Menu*. This is similar to the *Context Menu* in the *Collection Browser*, with a few extra options. Clicking on the *Context Menu* icon (three vertical dots) opens a dropdown with important file actions.

## CloudCannon's Editing Interfaces

When you click on a file in your *Collection Browser*, CloudCannon will open it in one of four Editing Interfaces: the Visual Editor, Content Editor, Data Editor, or Source Editor. Which Editing Interface CloudCannon uses will depend on the file type and any defaults you have configured for your Collection (we'll return to default Editing Interfaces in [Configure your Collections](/documentation/guides/getting-started/configure-your-collections/)). Each interface provides a different editing experience and tools specific to particular file types.

Let's take a look at each Editing Interface, including how to edit your files in each of them. You can follow along by opening the *Collection Browser* for one of your Collections, then clicking on any file to open it in an Editing Interface.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

### The *Editing Interface Header*

The *Editing interface Header* is at the top of every Editing Interface. It contains important tools for navigating your Editing Interface and Site.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

The *Editing Interface Header* has a *Return to Site* button on the left. You can click this button to go back to your *Collection Browser*. Next, it has the Collection icon, the file name, and the file path.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

Next is the *Update Status* indicator. This shows you when a file was last updated, and briefly displays the *Updating...* status whenever you edit your file. While CloudCannon is updating your file, we recommend that you don't switch Editing Interfaces or refresh your page.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

Every team member in your Organization has an *Avatar* (we'll cover this more in the [Add your team to CloudCannon](/documentation/guides/getting-started/add-your-team-to-cloudcannon/) step of this guide). The *Avatars* of team members who are currently viewing a file appear in the *Editing Interface Header*. The person currently editing a file will have a green outline and pencil icon next to their *Avatar*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

The *Switch Editing Interface* buttons allow you to easily change which Editing Interface your file is open in: the Visual, Content, Data, and Source Editors. Depending on the type of file you have open, how your collections are configured, and what permissions you have, the Switch Editing Interface buttons will show between two and four options.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

Up next is the *Context Menu*. This is similar to the *Context Menu* in the *Collection Browser*, with a few extra options. Clicking on the *Context Menu* icon (three vertical dots) opens a dropdown with important file actions.

* *Open recent*

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

&nbsp;

* *Open recent*
* *Open URL*
* *Copy URL*
* *Open Source Folder*
* *Copy Source Path*
* *Move to new folder*
* *Duplicate*
* *Rename*
* *Delete*
* *View diff*
* *Discard unsaved changes*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

* **The** ***Context menu*** **is in the top right of the** ***Editing interface navigation***\*\*, the same place as on a file card or folder. The\*\* ***Context menu*** **includes the following file actions:** ***Preview live site***\*\*,\*\* ***Copy output URL***\*\*,\*\* ***Open Source Folder***\*\*,\*\* ***Open Collection***\*\*,\*\* ***Publish to posts*** **(Jekyll only),** ***Move***\*\*,\*\* ***Clone***\*\*,\*\* ***Rename***\*\*,\*\* ***Download***\*\*,\*\* ***Discard unsaved changes***\*\*, and\*\* ***Delete*** **file actions.**
* **The** ***Information*** **button opens our** ***Editing help*** **modal.**
* **The** ***Save*** **button allows you to save your changes to all edited files. A red notification icon will indicate how many files have unsaved changes.**

&nbsp;

The *Editing Interface Header* overlaps with the *Site Header*, so important UI elements (the *Save* button and the *Dev Mode* switch) are always in the same place.

&nbsp;

Let's edit one of your files!

Try opening different file types, or switching between Editing Interfaces using the *Switch Editing Interface* buttons

## Editing interfaces

CloudCannon has four Editing Interfaces: the Visual Editor, Content Editor, Data Editor, and Source Editor. Each interface provides a different editing experience, with tools specific to particular file types.

Later in this guide we'll dive deeper into how to configure each Editing Interface.

### Visual Editor

[The Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/the-visual-editor/) is the most intuitive way to edit content in CloudCannon, using an interactive preview of your site. You can navigate your pages as you would on your live site and edit directly onto the page. This Editing Interface works for any file that outputs to an HTML page on your site.

<comp.DocsVideo url="https://player.vimeo.com/progressive_redirect/playback/949770947/rendition/1080p/file.mp4?loc=external&signature=5b5c24abc0922a7e42e3aab8b728a7d25e67c546b59b5499453d19bf37cf71aa" title="Visual Editor with data bindings" autoplay={true} loop={true}/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Depending on your SSG and site configuration, you may not have access to the Visual Editor for all files.
</comp.Notice>

The Visual Editor uses the sidebar or Data Panels for managing front matter content, each with customizable inputs to give your editing team a more intuitive interface.

CloudCannon requires you to build your Site to use the Visual Editor. We'll cover how to build your Site later in this guide.

### Content Editor

[The Content Editor](/documentation/articles/the-content-editor/) is a rich text editor for markup files. This editor is useful if you want a distraction-free, clean writing interface, particularly for blog posts and other content with a simple layout. You can configure the WYSIWYG toolbar for your Content Editor to ensure you have all the tools you need and edit structured data in the front matter of your markup files using the sidebar.

### Data Editor

We have already seen the [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/the-data-editor/) — the sidebar for managing front matter in the Visual and Content Editor. The Data Editor also manages content in YAML, TOML, JSON, CSV, and TSV files. The Data Editor uses inputs to provide an Editing Interface for structure data in your files.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/editing/editing-interfaces/2024-09/CloudCannon-Documentation-Data-Editor.png" alt="A screenshot of the Data Editor shows editable fields for a data file." title="The Data Editor" type="screenshot"/>

### Source Editor

[The Source Editor](/documentation/articles/the-source-editor/) is an in-Browser code editor, great for making small, quick changes. As with all the Editing Interfaces, any changes sync back to your Git repository.
