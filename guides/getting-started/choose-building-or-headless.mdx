      **Common Hugo Build Errors**

      If you built your site using the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">Hugo Quick Start guide</a>, you will have installed the Ananke theme for Hugo as a git submodule. CloudCannon doesn't support submodules by default, but you can clone the submodule repository using CloudCannon's build hooks.

      To fix this build error, create a .cloudcannon/preinstall file in the root directory of your repository, with this line of code:

      <comp.CodeBlock language="bash" source=".cloudcannon/preinstall">
                ```
                git clone https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
                ```
                </comp.CodeBlock>
    </comp.Notice>

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
      **Common Next.js Build Errors**

      Your build needs to output static files for CloudCannon to work correctly.

      If you are using Next.js v13.3.0 and above, you must add output: 'export' to your next.config.js file. Read the [Next.js documentation on Static Exports](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) for more information.

      For Next.js versions earlier than v13.3.0, you should add next export to your build command instead. For example, the build script in your package.json could be next build && next export.
