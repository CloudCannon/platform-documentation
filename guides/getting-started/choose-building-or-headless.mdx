A "build" is when CloudCannon converts all your Site files into a single, functional website.

You will eventually need to build your website to host it on the Internet, but you don't need to do it through CloudCannon. However, building through CloudCannon does enable specific features, such as the Visual Editor, preview screenshots for output files in your *Collection Browser*, and the Testing Domain and Custom Domain.

If you don't want these features or you use another software to build your website, you can disable builds to create a "headless" Site.

In this step of the guide, we'll cover the benefits and drawbacks of each option. When you are ready to select an option, click the *Configure your build* button or the *Go Headless* button under the *Build your build or go Headless* task on your *Getting started* task list.

You can change this setting at any time on the *Build Configuration* page under *Site Settings*.

## Building on CloudCannon

Why choose building?

&nbsp;

### Configure your build

If you want to build your Site through CloudCannon, click the *Configure your build* button in the *Build your build or go Headless* task on your *Getting started* task list. CloudCannon will open the *Configure your build* modal.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Configure-Build-Modal" alt="A screenshot of the Configure your build modal." title="The Configure your build modal" type="screenshot"/>

To build your Site, CloudCannon needs to know a few details about how your website functions. CloudCannon can make suggestions based on the SSG your Site uses and the contents of your files. These suggestions appear under each text field in the *Configure your build* modal in a light blue box.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Build-Configuration-Install-Command-Suggestion" alt="A screenshot of the Install Command text field and CloudCannon's suggested value in a light blue box." title="The build suggestions box" type="ui-snippet"/>

You can enter your own build settings or accept a suggestion by clicking on it and CloudCannon will populate the text field. If you are unsure about the answers to any of these questions, please contact your developer or reach out to our friendly [support team](/support/).

Under the *Command line options* section, enter your *Install Command*, *Build Command*, *Output Path*, and *Environment Variables*. These help CloudCannon...

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Build-Configuration-Command-Line-Options" alt="A screenshot of the Configure your build modal shows the command line options." title="The Configure your build modal" type="screenshot"/>

Under the *Build system options* section, enter your *Preserved Paths*, and choose whether you want to enable the *Preserve Output*, *Include .git folder*, and *Manually Configure URLs* settings.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Build-Configuration-Build-System-Options" alt="A screenshot of the Configure your build modal shows the build system options, including Preserved Paths." title="The Configure your build modal" type="screenshot"/>

Finally, under the *Library Versions* section, review the versions of *Hugo*, *Ruby*, *Node*, and *Deno*. If your website uses any of these libraries, please ensure the version number is correct.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Build-Configuration-Library-Versions" alt="A screenshot of the Configure your build modal shows the library versions for Hugo, Ruby, Node, and Deno." title="The Configure your build modal" type="screenshot"/>

When you are happy with your answers, click the *Update configuration and Build* button. CloudCannon will start your first Site build using the configuration you defined.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  **Common Hugo Build Errors**

  If you built your site using the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">Hugo Quick Start guide</a>, you will have installed the Ananke theme for Hugo as a git submodule. CloudCannon doesn't support submodules by default, but you can clone the submodule repository using CloudCannon's build hooks.

  To fix this build error, create a .cloudcannon/preinstall file in the root directory of your repository, with this line of code:

  <comp.CodeBlock language="bash" source=".cloudcannon/preinstall">
                              ```
                              git clone https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
                              ```
                              </comp.CodeBlock>
</comp.Notice>

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  **Common Next.js Build Errors**

  Your build needs to output static files for CloudCannon to work correctly.

  If you are using Next.js v13.3.0 and above, you must add output: 'export' to your next.config.js file. Read the [Next.js documentation on Static Exports](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) for more information.

  For Next.js versions earlier than v13.3.0, you should add next export to your build command instead. For example, the build script in your package.json could be next build && next export.
</comp.Notice>

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  **Common Nuxt Build Errors**

  Sometimes, your terminal will say that the build did not output any files. This is a common problem for Nuxt sites on CloudCannon but is usually easy to fix. Ensure you use the nuxt generate command and that the output directory matches the output specified in your Nuxt configuration.
</comp.Notice>

## Headless Mode on CloudCannon

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  **Going to use Headless Mode?**

  If you decide to use Headless Mode on CloudCannon, we recommend you switch to the [Getting Started with Headless](/documentation/guides/getting-started-with-headless/) guide. We've removed any irrelevant information for a more streamlined onboarding process.
</comp.Notice>

A "headless" website is one where the frontend and backend are separated. In Headless Mode, CloudCannon still manages your content but doesn't affect any frontend activities like building or hosting. By decoupling your website content from the presentation layer, you can manage the content independently from the output format.

Headless Mode might be right for you if:

* You already use another software to build your website.

Enabling Headless Mode will disable building and hosting for your Site on CloudCannon.

If you want to put your Site in Headless Mode, click the *Go Headless* button in the *Build your build or go Headless* task on your *Getting started* task list. CloudCannon will open the *Go Headless* modal.

Confirm your choice by clicking the *Turn off hosting and builds* button.
