A “build” is when CloudCannon converts all your Site files into a single, functional website.

You will eventually need to build your website to host it on the Internet, but you don't need to do it through CloudCannon. However, building through CloudCannon does enable specific features, such as the Visual Editor, preview screenshots for output files in your *Collection Browser*, and the Testing Domain and Custom Domain.

If you don’t want these features or you use another software to build your website, you can disable builds to create a “headless” Site.

In this step of the guide, we'll cover the benefits and drawbacks of each option. When you are ready to select an option, click the *I want to build* button or *Use Headless Mode* button under the *Build your Site or go Headless* task on your *Getting started* task list.

You can change this setting at any time on the *Build Configuration* page under *Site Settings*.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  **Common Hugo Build Errors**

  If you built your site using the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">Hugo Quick Start guide</a>, you will have installed the Ananke theme for Hugo as a git submodule. CloudCannon doesn't support submodules by default, but you can clone the submodule repository using CloudCannon's build hooks.

  To fix this build error, create a .cloudcannon/preinstall file in the root directory of your repository, with this line of code:

  <comp.CodeBlock language="bash" source=".cloudcannon/preinstall">
                  ```
                  git clone https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
                  ```
                  </comp.CodeBlock>
</comp.Notice>

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  **Common Next.js Build Errors**

  Your build needs to output static files for CloudCannon to work correctly.

  If you are using Next.js v13.3.0 and above, you must add output: 'export' to your next.config.js file. Read the [Next.js documentation on Static Exports](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) for more information.

  For Next.js versions earlier than v13.3.0, you should add next export to your build command instead. For example, the build script in your package.json could be next build && next export.
</comp.Notice>

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  **Common Nuxt Build Errors**

  Sometimes, your terminal will say that the build did not output any files. This is a common problem for Nuxt sites on CloudCannon but is usually easy to fix. Ensure you use the nuxt generate command and that the output directory matches the output specified in your Nuxt configuration.
