The Content Editor supports managing structured data via Snippets.

## Snippets

CloudCannon supports embedding rich Snippets in Markdown files when using the Content Editor. Snippets appear as blocks in your rich text view, and once configured, the Snippets icon in your WYSIWYG toolbar will provide a modal menu for your content team to select from.

To get started with Snippets, read our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/snippets-using-mdx-components/#custom-mdx-components">Custom MDX Components guide</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/support/">reach out to our support team</a>.

## Snippets

It is easy to supplement your Markdown content with React components, building an interactive page editing experience for you team — all without touching the underlying code. Snippets are structured components which you can create and edit to suit your needs. You can create your own custom Snippets with our [Custom MDX Components guide](/documentation/articles/snippets-using-mdx-components/#custom-mdx-components), but for now let’s import the default MDX Snippets configurations.

Currently, you cannot configure Snippets through the Configuration GUI, however, it is easy to do manually. Navigate to your CloudCannon global configuration file through the Files tab in your navigation sidebar. The configuration file will be in the root of your directory.

Docusaurus uses both regular MDX components along with custom extensions, so we can import both the `mdx` Snippets and the `docusaurus_mdx` Snippets.

Your `_snippets_imports` should look something like this:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
    ```
    _snippets_imports:
      mdx: true
      docusaurus_mdx: true
    ```
    </comp.MultiCodeBlock>

For more information, check out our [Docusaurus Components](/documentation/articles/snippets-using-docusaurus-components/) documentation.

CloudCannon supports Snippets in the Nunjucks and Liquid templating languages, which can imported with the `eleventy_nunjucks` and `eleventy_liquid` keys. CloudCannon also provides support for the `raw` tag out-of-the-box, which will output any Liquid or Nunjucks code as plain text instead of rendering it. If you don’t need the `raw` tag, you can exclude this snippet.

Your `_snippets_imports` might look something like this:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
    ```
    _snippets_imports:
      eleventy_nunjucks___1___:
        exclude:
          - eleventy_nunjucks_raw
    ```
    <comp.Annotation number="1">
    Exclude the Nunjucks raw tag.
    </comp.Annotation> </comp.MultiCodeBlock>

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
    ```
    _snippets_imports:
      eleventy_liquid___1___:
        exclude:
          - eleventy_liquid_raw
    ```
    <comp.Annotation number="1">
    Exclude the Liquid raw tag.
    </comp.Annotation> </comp.MultiCodeBlock>
