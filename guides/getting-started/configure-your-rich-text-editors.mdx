The Content Editor supports managing structured data via Snippets.

## Snippets

CloudCannon supports embedding rich Snippets in Markdown files when using the Content Editor. Snippets appear as blocks in your rich text view, and once configured, the Snippets icon in your WYSIWYG toolbar will provide a modal menu for your content team to select from.

To get started with Snippets, read our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/snippets-using-mdx-components/#custom-mdx-components">Custom MDX Components guide</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/support/">reach out to our support team</a>.

## Snippets

It is easy to supplement your Markdown content with React components, building an interactive page editing experience for you team — all without touching the underlying code. Snippets are structured components which you can create and edit to suit your needs. You can create your own custom Snippets with our [Custom MDX Components guide](/documentation/articles/snippets-using-mdx-components/#custom-mdx-components), but for now let’s import the default MDX Snippets configurations.

Currently, you cannot configure Snippets through the Configuration GUI, however, it is easy to do manually. Navigate to your CloudCannon global configuration file through the Files tab in your navigation sidebar. The configuration file will be in the root of your directory.

Docusaurus uses both regular MDX components along with custom extensions, so we can import both the `mdx` Snippets and the `docusaurus_mdx` Snippets.

Your `_snippets_imports` should look something like this:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
    ```
    _snippets_imports:
      mdx: true
      docusaurus_mdx: true
    ```
    </comp.MultiCodeBlock>

For more information, check out our [Docusaurus Components](/documentation/articles/snippets-using-docusaurus-components/) documentation.

CloudCannon supports Snippets in the Nunjucks and Liquid templating languages, which can imported with the `eleventy_nunjucks` and `eleventy_liquid` keys. CloudCannon also provides support for the `raw` tag out-of-the-box, which will output any Liquid or Nunjucks code as plain text instead of rendering it. If you don’t need the `raw` tag, you can exclude this snippet.

Your `_snippets_imports` might look something like this:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
    ```
    _snippets_imports:
      eleventy_nunjucks___1___:
        exclude:
          - eleventy_nunjucks_raw
    ```
    <comp.Annotation number="1">
    Exclude the Nunjucks raw tag.
    </comp.Annotation> </comp.MultiCodeBlock>

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
    ```
    _snippets_imports:
      eleventy_liquid___1___:
        exclude:
          - eleventy_liquid_raw
    ```
    <comp.Annotation number="1">
    Exclude the Liquid raw tag.
    </comp.Annotation> </comp.MultiCodeBlock>

## Visual Editor Previews

In a previous section of this guide, we talked about the Visual Editor — an intuitive way to edit your site by clicking directly on a preview of your page. But how do you make each region editable in the Visual Editor?

### Editable class

To edit HTML in the Visual Editor, add the class ‘editable’ to HTML elements. This way, you can give as much or as little access to your content team as you need.

You can define add the ‘editable’ class to your site in the Source Editor:

<comp.CodeBlock language="HTML" source="homepage.html">
    ```
          <p class="editable">I'm editable in the visual editor</p>
          <p>I'm <strong>not</strong> editable in the visual editior</p>
    ```
    </comp.CodeBlock>

The element you apply the ‘editable’ class to will change the editing options in the WYSIWYG toolbar. For example, adding the editable class to an &lt;h1&gt; element will provide basic text formatting options. Adding it to a `<div>` element will open the option to add images, lists, and tables. You can [customize the WYSIWYG toolbar](/documentation/articles/configuring-toolbars) to have complete control over what editors can and cannot add to each element.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Changes made to the HTML save back to your layout, which might affect multiple content files.
</comp.Notice>
