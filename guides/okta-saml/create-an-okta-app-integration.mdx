On CloudCannon, navigate to the *Single Sign-On* page under *Org Settings*. We'll need details from this page later. For now, we'll just leave this page open in a tab.

On Okta, "App Integrations" are configured connections between Okta and external applications that provide a service â€” in this case, CloudCannon. Once you add CloudCannon as an App Integration, Okta will generate the XML certificate CloudCannon needs for its SAML request.

In another tab, open [Okta](https://www.okta.com/). Log in and navigate to the *Applications* page under *Applications* in the sidebar.

Click the *Create App Integration* button. Okta will open the *Create a new app integration* modal.

Select the *SAML 2.0* option under *Sign-in method* and click the *Next* button. Okta will open the *Create SAML Integration* page.

The first tab on the *Create SAML Integration* page is *General Settings*.

Enter "CloudCannon" in the *App name* text field. You also have the option to upload the [CloudCannon Logo](https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/icons/CloudCannon-Logo-Blue.svg). Adding a logo can help you find the CloudCannon app integration in your list of integrations.

Click the *Next* button. Okta will open the *Configure SAML* tab.

For this step of the guide, we need to copy some details from the *Single Sign-On* page on CloudCannon into Okta: the *Consume URL (SSO URL)*, which Okta calls the *Single sign-on URL*. The *Consume URL* is the CloudCannon address to which Okta will redirect users after they enter their login in details.

The *Consume URL* on the *Single Sign-On* page should look like `https://app.cloudcannon.com/saml/xxxxx/consume`, except the `x` characters will be your CloudCannon Organization ID.

Copy the *Consume URL* from CloudCannon into the *Single sign-on URL* text field on Okta.

Next, we need to provide Okta with the *Audience URI (SP Entity ID)*. The *Entity ID* defines the intended recipient for your SAML assertion: it's CloudCannon again!

Enter `https://cloudcannon.com/` in the *Audience URI (SP Entity ID)* text field.

The rest of the fields on this page are not required for basic SSO/SAML, but you can fill them in now if you need them for your workflow.

Click the *Next* button. Okta will open the *Feedback* tab.

We don't need to add any details on the *Feedback* tab, as Okta only uses this information to improve their service rather than to set up an app integration. Click the *Finish* button.

Okta will open the *Application* page for the CloudCannon app integration you just created.

In the next step of this guide, we will cover downloading the XML certificate from Okta and adding it to CloudCannon.
