Welcome to CloudCannon's getting started guide!

CloudCannon is a Git-based Content Management System designed to help teams (or individuals) manage their website content and code. Developers can commit changes to your Git repository that sync to CloudCannon, while non-technical team members can effortlessly update and manage your content without knowing anything about Git, Markdown, or HTML. All your files are stored safely and securely in your Git repository — no vendor lock-in.

In this guide, we’ll cover how to create an account, add your files to a Site, and configure it for the best CloudCannon experience. Some of these steps are optional (we'll point out which ones), so you can pick and choose what's right for you.

Before we begin, this guide assumes you already have a website and your files are uploaded to a Git repository. Although you can <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/create-a-site-with-direct-upload/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upload files directly</a> from your hard drive, we highly recommend using a Git repository.
