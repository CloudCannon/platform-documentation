Once you have created your CloudCannon configuration file, CloudCannon will return you to the *Summary* tab of the *Status* page.

A "build" is when CloudCannon converts all your Site files into a single, functional website. Building your Site on CloudCannon is optional. You can disable builds for dynamic or externally-hosted Sites by enabling Headless Mode.

To enable Headless Mode, click the *I don't want to build* button.
