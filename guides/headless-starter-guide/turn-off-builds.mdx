Once you have created your CloudCannon configuration file, CloudCannon will return you to the *Summary* tab of the *Status* page. This page will prompt you to choose how you want to build your Site.

A "build" is when CloudCannon converts all your Site files into a single, functional website. Building your Site on CloudCannon is optional. You can disable builds for dynamic or externally hosted Sites by enabling Headless Mode.

To enable Headless Mode, click the *I don't want to build* button.

CloudCannon will enable Headless Mode on your Site, preventing builds and streamlining your *Site Settings* by removing unneeded options.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  You can reenable builds at any time by selecting *Hosted* *Mode* on the *Details* page under *Site Settings*.
</comp.Notice>

The *Status* page will update to show you have opted out of builds.
