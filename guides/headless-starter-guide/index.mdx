Welcome to the CloudCannon starter guide for Headless Sites! If you want to get your Site editable on CloudCannon and not worry about building, you are in the right place.

Before we start, this guide assumes you already have a site uploaded to a Git repository. Although you can <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/create-a-site-with-direct-upload/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upload files directly</a> from your hard drive, we highly recommend using a Git repository.

Don’t have any site yet? No worries! You can create one with our <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/tutorials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jamstack tutorials for your favorite SSGs</a>.

In this guide we’ll cover how to create your first site, and configure it for the best CloudCannon experience.

## What is CloudCannon?

CloudCannon is a Git-based Content Management System. With CloudCannon, you can easily build and maintain your Site using familiar Git workflows. Plus, your content team can effortlessly update and manage the content without knowing anything about Git, Markdown, or HTML.

CloudCannon supports dynamic and externally-hosted Sites with Headless Mode. Headless Mode disables builds and streamlines your CloudCannon interface by removing settings you don't need.
