    Let's take a tour of CloudCannon!
  </comp.SlotContent>
  <comp.SlotContent name="Site-Navigation-tour">
    Your *Site Navigation* is the gray sidebar on the left of the app, next to your *App* *Navigation*. The *Site Navigation* sidebar contains information and tools you will use often.

    <comp.DocsImage path="" alt="" title=""/>

    Your *Site Navigation* contains:

    * **Projects dropdown** — If your Site is part of a [Project](/documentation/articles/create-a-project/), the *Projects dropdown* shows you which Project your Site belongs to and which Sites (if any) it publishes to.
    * **Site icon, Site name, and branch name** — These are your basic Site details, so you know which Site you are editing.
    * **Avatars** — The avatars for any team members active on your Site. Clicking on an avatar will show a list of files they have open, with an eye icon for file they are *Viewing* and a pencil for *Editing*.
    * **The Save button** — Opens the *Review your changes* modal and allows you to commit changes to your Git repository.
    * **The Publish button** — If your Site has a [publish branch](/documentation/articles/connect-a-publish-branch/), this button allows you to create a Pull Request or immediately merge your changes from this Site to any Sites it publishes to.
    * **Site Dashboard** — Your Site home page, showing recent activity on your Site.
    * **Collections** — Groups of related content, such as a folder of blog articles, Staff Member profiles, or product pages.
    * **Developer Tools** — Tools for managing your Site, including the *Status* page, file browser, and *Site Settings*.

  <comp.SlotContent name="Dashboard-tour">
    The *Dashboard* is the first item below the *Site Navigation* header. You Dashboard is the first place you arrive when you open a Site in CloudCannon and gives you and overview of your Site.

    There are two tabs on your Dashboard: *Summary*, and *Activity*.

    On the *Summary* tab you'll find buttons to open the *Publishing* page and recently opened files, and a list of recent activity on your Site.

    On the *Activity* tab you'll find more paginated activity in reverse chronological order for every change to your content or settings.
