  Learn about Collections in CloudCannon, including what they are and how to add
  them.

A major benefit of using a CMS is the ability to organize your files in a user-friendly interface for easy browsing.

In CloudCannon, you can group the files you want to edit into *Collections* (groups of similar files stored in the same folder of your website, e.g., a folder of pages, blog posts, product descriptions, or data files). Then, you can view, sort, filter, and scroll through all your files in a *Collection browser* by clicking on the name of a *Collection* in your *Site Navigation*.

Let's complete the next task in the *Getting Started with Editing* in-app guide: *Group your files into Collections*. As part of this task, we'll also learn about *Configuration Mode*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Add-Collections-Task" alt="A screenshot of the Add a Collection task from the Getting Started in-app guide." title="The Add a Collection task" type="ui-snippet"/>

## What is *Configuration Mode*?

*Configuration Mode* is a tool for updating the configuration of your *Site*. The *Configuration Mode switch* on the right of your *Site Header* allows you to toggle *Configuration Mode* on and off.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Header-Tools" alt="A screenshot of the Site Header tools shows the Avatar List, Configuration Mode toggle, and the Save button with one unsaved change." title="The Site Header tools" type="ui-snippet"/>

When *Configuration Mode* is on, CloudCannon will display *Edit configuration* buttons next to each element of the app you can configure. These *Edit configuration* buttons are all in purple, making them easy to find and visually distinct from other UI elements.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-No-Collections" alt="A screenshot of the Site Dashboard shows the Getting Started in-app guide and a purple Edit Collections button in the Site Navigation." title="The Site Dashboard" type="screenshot"/>

Clicking on one of the *Edit configuration* buttons will open a modal or data panel with fields for configuring the UI element. You will be able to see any visual changes in CloudCannon in real time, and all your changes will be added to your *CloudCannon Configuration File*.

When *Configuration Mode* is off, CloudCannon hides all the *Edit configuration* buttons, creating an uncluttered interface for content creators. We recommend spending most of your time with *Configuration Mode* off for a better editing experience, but you can always turn it on to make a quick change your *Site* configuration.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p><strong>Who can use </strong><em><strong>Configuration Mode</strong></em><strong>?</strong></p><p>Turning on <em>Configuration Mode</em> only affects the way your Site looks for you; the purple <em>Edit configuration</em> buttons do not appear for other users of your <em>Site</em>.</p><p>You can restrict the capacity to use <em>Configuration Mode</em> to specific team members using permissions. We recommend you check out this guide after you have finished <em>Getting Started</em>.</p>
</comp.Notice>

## Editing your *Collections* using *Configuration Mode*

*Collections* appear in your *Site Navigation* for easy access; the *Edit Collections* button is also in your *Site Navigation* and is visible when you turn on *Configuration Mode*.

Click the *Configuration Mode switch* on the right of the *Site Header* to turn it on. Purple *Edit configuration* buttons will appear in several places across the CloudCannon UI, including the *Edit Collections* button in the *Site Navigation.*

Click on the *Edit Collections* button to open the *Edit Collections* modal.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Add-Collections-Modal" alt="A screenshot of the Edit Collections modal shows a tree structure of potential Collections detected from your files." title="The Edit Collections modal" type="screenshot"/>

The *Edit Collections* modal displays all the folders from your repository in a tree structure. You can click on any folders highlighted in blue to expand them further.

When you synced your files to your *Site*, CloudCannon also detected which folders contain files you might want to edit as a *Collection*. These folders are marked with the blue *Suggested* badge.

Each folder has the following details:

* A unique *Path*, defining the location of the folder in your repository, relative to the *Source Folder*.
* An *Icon* from [Google's Material Symbols and Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Symbols&amp;icon.style=Rounded), which is the one with the most similar name to the *Collection* *Key*, by default.
* A  unique *Key*, derived from your *Collection Path*, which is used to store all your *Collection* configuration options in the *CloudCannon Configuration File*.

The name of each *Collection* is the *Key* in title case form (i.e., `travel_blog` becomes "Travel Blog"). You can override this by configuring a *Display Name* later .

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Add-Collections-Modal-Select-Collections" alt="A screenshot of the Edit Collections modal shows that three Collections are selected." title="The Edit Collections modal" type="screenshot"/>

Select the *Collections* you want using the checkboxes next to each folder. When you select a folder, CloudCannon will show you how many files are in each *Collection*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Add-Collections-Modal-Detected-Collection" alt="A screenshot of a selected Collection from the Edit Collections modal shows a file path, key, name, icon, and how many files are included." title="A selected Collection" type="ui-snippet"/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  **What happens when you select one** ***Collection*** **nested inside of another?**

  Files can only belong to one *Collection* at a time. If you select two *Collections*, one nested inside another, the files will appear in the *Collection* with the most specific *Path*.

  Let's walk through an example.

  <comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/guides/getting-started/2025-09/CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-File-Structure.png" alt="An illustration of a file structure shows a blog folder with two nested files and a nested authors folder, which also has two nested files." title="An example file structure" type="ui-snippet"/>

  Assume you have an `authors` folder nested in your `blog` folder (i.e., `/blog/authors/`). The `authors` folder contains non-output data files with profile information about your various blog authors. In addition to the `authors` folder, the `blog` folder also contains all your output blog files. In this case, both the `authors` and `blog` folders could be *Collections*.

  If you only add the "Blog" *Collection* with the path `/blog/`, all your output blog files will belong to this *Collection*, but so will all the data files inside `/blog/authors/`. All these files will appear as a sub-folder in your Blog *Collection Browser*.

  Adding the "Blog" *Collection* and the "Authors" *Collection* will separate these files, keeping your output blog files in one *Collection Browser* and your non-output data files in another.
</comp.Notice>

Like the *Create my Configuration File* modal in the previous step, you can click on the *Show changes* button in the bottom left to preview the contents you are adding to your *CloudCannon Configuration File*.

Here's an example of what that configuration code might look like:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````

collections_config___1___:
  news___2___:
    path___3___: /blog/news/
    icon___4___: breaking_news

``````````
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  All *Collections* are defined under the `collections_config` key in your *CloudCannon Configuration File*.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="2">
  The *Key* for this *Collection* is `news`. All the configuration for this *Collection* is stored nder this *Key*.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="3">
  The *Path* for this *Collection* is `/blog/news/`, telling CloudCannon where to find the *Collection* files in your repository.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="4">
  The *Icon* for this *Collection* is `breaking_news`.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

When you are happy with your selection, click the *\+ Add Collection* button at the bottom of the modal. Your *Collections* will appear in the *Site Navigation.*

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-New-Collections" alt="A screenshot of the Site Dashboard shows several Collections in the Site Navigation above the Edit Collections button." title="The Site Dashboard" type="screenshot"/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p>If you need to add or remove <em>Collections</em> in the future, the <em>Edit Collections</em> button will appear in the <em>Site Navigation</em> whenever you turn on <em>Configuration Mode</em>. Use the checkboxes to select or deselect <em>Collections</em>.</p><comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Add-Collections-Modal-Change-Collections" alt="A screenshot of the Edit Collections modal shows one existing Collection and one unselected Collection with the Remove badge." title="The Edit Collections modal" type="ui-snippet"/>
</comp.Notice>

Mark the *Group your files into Collections* task as complete when you are ready to move on.

In the next step of this guide, we'll look at a *Collection Browser* and introduce you to some important UI for managing your files in CloudCannon.
