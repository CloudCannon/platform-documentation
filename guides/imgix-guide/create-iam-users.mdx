In this step you can create one IAM user or optionally, two users for best practice. By creating two users, one from CloudCannon to S3 and one from S3 to IMGIX, you can ensure the IMGIX user does not have access to upload to your DAM, only read its contents. This follows the principles of separation of concern. If you choose to create two users, we recommend naming them some variant of “CloudCannon-to-S3” and “S3-to-IMGIX”.

It is not necessary to create two users; one user will work.

1. Open AWS and navigate to *IAM* under *Security, Identity, & Compliance* section in the main menu.
2. Navigate to *Users* under *Access management*.
3. Click the *Add Users* button.
4. Enter the name of the user.
5. Set the *AWS credential type* as ”Access key - Programmatic access”.
6. Click the *Next: Permissions* button.
7. Click *Attach existing policies directly* and select the policy you created earlier.
8. Click the *Next: Tags* button, then the *Next: Review* button.
9. Click *Create user*.
10. (Optional) Repeat steps 3 to 9 to create a second user.

You can [recreate your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys_retrieve.html) if you lose it. You can have a maximum of two access keys per user.
