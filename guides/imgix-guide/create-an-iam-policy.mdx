Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies determine what actions are allowed for content in your S3 bucket. We must create a policy allowing CloudCannon to perform specific actions for your bucket and any object stored within it.

For more information about Amazon S3 policies, please see their <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-policy-language-overview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation</a>.

1. Open AWS and navigate to *IAM* under *Security, Identity, & Compliance* section in the main menu.
2. Navigate to *Policies* under *Access management*.
3. Click the *Create Policy* button.
4. Open the *JSON* tab of the new policy and paste the following JSON code. Make sure to replace “PlaceholderBucketName” with your S3 bucket name.

<comp.CodeBlock language="JSON" source="policy.json">
```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObjectAcl",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
        "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:PutObjectAcl",
        "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::<PlaceholderBucketName>",
        "arn:aws:s3:::<PlaceholderBucketName>/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

5. Click the *Next: Tags* button, then click *Next* again.
6. Give your policy a name, then click *Create policy*.
