No one likes slow web pages. Images and videos on your website can contribute to long loading times and negatively affect your user experience. Image and video content can also contribute to long build times in CloudCannon. Storing large visual files in your Git repository will quickly increase its size, which can affect your Site's performance.

It is important to deliver high-quality, optimized visual content on your website while minimizing the wait time for your users. For Sites with many large files, we recommend using an external Digital Asset Manager (DAM) and a content optimization tool. In this guide, we will teach you how to connect an Amazon S3 DAM and IMGIX to your CloudCannon Site.

The Amazon Simple Storage Service ([Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)) is a cloud asset storage solution. [IMGIX](https://www.imgix.com/) is an image and video processing tool that integrates with your Amazon S3 DAM and CloudCannon. By using an Amazon S3 DAM and IMGIX, you can:

* Improve your Site build times.
* Use the same assets across Sites with different Git repositories.
* Serve optimal-sized assets depending on your user's device and internet connection.
* Keep the assets in your S3 bucket private.

This guide assumes you already have IMGIX and AWS S3 accounts, as well as a CloudCannon Site and an Amazon S3 bucket. To create an Amazon S3 bucket, please read the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html).
