Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) defines how web applications in one domain can interact with resources in a different domain.

To allow CloudCannon to interact with your S3 bucket, you must explicitly enable cross-origin requests.

1. Open AWS and select your S3 bucket.
2. Open the *Permissions* tab, scroll to the *Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)* section, and click *Edit*.
3. Copy the following JSON code into your CORS settings.
4. Click save.

<comp.CodeBlock language="json" source="CORS.json">
```
[
  {
    "AllowedHeaders": [
      "*"
    ],
    "AllowedMethods": [
      "GET",
      "PUT",
      "POST",
      "DELETE",
      "HEAD"
    ],
    "AllowedOrigins": [
      "*"
    ],
    "ExposeHeaders": []
  }
]
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

The above code does not restrict which URLs are allowed to access your S3 bucket. As an optional extra step, you can edit the `AllowedOrigins` key to restrict access to your Sites. Origins can match a single URL, such as `https://my-site.com`, or multiple URLs using wildcard characters, `https://*.my-site.com`.

If you edit your `AllowedOrigins` you must also include `https://app.cloudcannon.com`, to ensure that CloudCannon can pull previews of your assets within the editor.

Here is an example:

<comp.CodeBlock language="json" source="CORS.json">
```
"AllowedOrigins": [
  "https://*.my-site.com",
  "https://app.cloudcannon.com"
]
```
</comp.CodeBlock>
