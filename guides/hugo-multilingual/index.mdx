Hugo has two approaches to manage translated content with files:

* including the language code in the **filename**, or
* including the language code in the **content directory/folder**.

Note that Hugo does not support using both approaches at the same time. 

Because CloudCannon collections are based around folders, the approach you choose will change the editing experience. This guide outlines the best practices for each approach.

This guide focuses on integrating with CloudCannon, it does **not** cover:

- Setting up a [multilingual Hugo](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/) site; we recommend [Hugo Multilingual Part 1: Content translation](https://www.regisphilibert.com/blog/2018/08/hugo-multilingual-part-1-managing-content-translation/) by RÃ©gis Philibert.
- The Hugo `i18n` shortcode, which could be added as a [Snippet](/documentation/articles/editing-with-hugo-shortcodes/).
- [Multihost](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-multilingual-multihost) introduces editing problems as a site on CloudCannon uses one domain. Using multiple sites in a staging-production workflow can work around this.
