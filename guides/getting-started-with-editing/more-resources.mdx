Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

By following each step in this guide so far, you have set up a basic WYSIWYG editing for your *Site* on CloudCannon. But there's a lot more to CloudCannon that we haven't covered yet. Check out the sections below for more resources to help you on your CloudCannon journey.

Thanks for finishing the *Getting Started with Editing* guide! If you have any questions, please reach out to our friendly [support team](/support/). We're always here to help.

## User guides

Now that you have basic WYSIWYG editing set up on your *Site*, you can start using CloudCannon to manage your content. Here are a few guides to help you and your team learn important skills for working in CloudCannon.

Most of these guides have in-app counterparts. You can find a complete list of guides that configure your *Site* (rather than your *Organization*) under the *Guides* tab on your *Site Dashboard*. You can also see your current in-app guide on the *Summary* tab by marking it as active.
