The next task in the *Getting Started with Editing* in-app guide is to *Create your CloudCannon Configuration File*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-No-Config" alt="A screenshot of the Site Dashboard shows the Getting Started tasklist with a task to create your CloudCannon Configuration File." title="The Site Dashboard" type="screenshot"/>

The CloudCannon Configuration File is the heart of your CloudCannon experience, allowing you to customize the functionality and appearance of your Site. Adding formatted content to your Configuration File lets you configure your *Site Navigation*, Editing Interfaces, file appearance in the app, how CloudCannon adds new files, and more.

As we go through the later steps of this guide, we'll add more to our Configuration File. Let's create one.

## Initial content for the *CloudCannon Configuration File*

Click the *\+ Create my Configuration File* button in your task list under the *Create your CloudCannon Configuration File* task. CloudCannon will open the *Create my Configuration File* modal.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Create-Config-File-Task" alt="A screenshot of the Create your CloudCannon Configuration File task from the Getting Started task list shows the Create my Configuration File button." title="The Create a Configuration File task" type="ui-snippet"/>

The CloudCannon Configuration File is stored at the root of your website directory by default and can be YAML or JSON. When you answer the questions in this modal, CloudCannon will create the `/cloudcannon.config.yml` file in the root of your repository.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Create-Config-File-Modal" alt="A screenshot of the Create my Configuration File modal shows text fields for selecting your SSG and source folder." title="The Create my Configuration File modal" type="screenshot"/>

To start with, CloudCannon needs to know two key pieces of information about your *Site*: which Static Site Generator (SSG) you are using and where your *Source Folder* is in your repository.

An SSG is a tool for generating a static HTML website from your files. CloudCannon supports various SSGs, from Astro, Eleventy, and Hugo to Jekyll, MkDocs, and Lume. You can choose whichever SSG is appropriate for your website files.

CloudCannon will use the information found in your files to suggest an SSG. You can click on the suggested SSG to select it, or use an option from the *Static Site Generator* dropdown.

The Source Folder defines the base path for your SSG source files relative to the root of your directory. Most websites use the root of their repository as the *Source Folder*. However, if your source folder is nested in your repository (such as if you have a mono-repo), you should check the *Use custom source* box and enter the file path in the *Source Folder* text field.

At the bottom of the *Create my Configuration File* modal, you will see a dropdown called *Initial content for `/cloudcannon.config.yml`*. If you are interested in the format of your Configuration File, you can expand this to see the content CloudCannon will add to the file. This content is based on your answers to the above questions and converted to YAML.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Create-Config-File-Modal-Code" alt="A screenshot of the Create my Configuration File modal shows the initial content CloudCannon will add to your Configuration File." title="The Create my Configuration File modal" type="screenshot"/>

Click the *Create my Configuration File* button at the bottom of the modal. CloudCannon will add `cloudcannon.config.yml` to the root of your repository. Go ahead and mark the task as complete.

Congratulations! You've made your first change to your website content: adding a file. You might notice that the *Save* button in the top right now has a red "1" notification. This indicates that you have made a change to one file. Don't click the Save button just yetâ€”we'll talk about saving changes to your Site in the [editing files and saving changes](/documentation/guides/getting-started-with-editing/editing-files-and-saving-changes/) step of this guide.

Now that we have a *Configuration File*, we can start defining our preferences and settings to customize our *Site*. Let's start by grouping the files we want to edit into *Collections* and reviewing them in a user-friendly interface called a *Collection Browser*.

In the next step of this guide, we'll cover *Collections*, including what they are and how to add them to your *Site Navigation* using your *CloudCannon Configuration File*.
