Congratulations!

By following each step in this guide so far, you have set up a basic Site in CloudCannon and learnt important skills for managing your content. But, there's a lot more to CloudCannon that we haven't covered yet.

We've broken these topics into other guides to prevent this guide from becoming overwhelming. While technically optional, we highly recommend reading through these steps to figure out which configuration you need.

You can complete these guides in any order, but here's the order we suggest:

* [Configure your Collections](/documentation/guides/configure-your-collections/) — Configure how your Collections look and function, including file Card appearance, how CloudCannon adds new files, what editing interfaces Collections should use, and what URL file should output to.
* Configure your Editing Interfaces —
* Configure your Rich Text Editors —
* Configure visual editing —
* Configure web hosting —
* Add your team to CloudCannon —
* Create a Project —
* Customize your Organization Branding —
* Subscribe to CloudCannon —
