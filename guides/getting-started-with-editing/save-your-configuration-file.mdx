  Learn how to save the changes to your Configuration File back to your Git
  repository.
---
Over the course of this guide, we have added content to the *CloudCannon Configuration File* several times. CloudCannon will live update every time you add the *Configuration File*, but it is still important to save your changes back to your Git repository.

Let's commit the *CloudCannon Configuration File* and your CloudCannon preferences to your Git repository.

The *Save* button is on the right of your *Site Header*, and will show a red notification with the number of files that have unsaved changes. In this case, the *CloudCannon Configuration File* is the only file with unsaved changes.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Header-Tools" alt="A screenshot of the Site Header tools shows the Avatar List, Configuration Mode toggle, and the Save button with one unsaved change." title="The Site Header tools" type="ui-snippet"/>

Click the *Save* button. CloudCannon will open the *Save changes* modal.

The *Save changes* modal allows you to review a summary of all unsaved changes on a *Site*. Each file with unsaved changes is represented by a *File Card*, including the name of the file, the *Collection* it belongs to, when it was last updated and by whom.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p>If you have multiple people working on the same Site, the <em>Save changes</em> modal will separate the files into the <em>My changes</em> and <em>Other changes</em> sections. By default, only files where you have contributed to the unsaved changes are selected, but you can save changes made by your team members if you need to.</p><comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Save-Changes-Modal-Multiple-Contributors" alt="A screenshot of the Save changes modal shows that multiple contributors have files with unsaved changes." title="The Save Changes modal" type="ui-snippet"/>
</comp.Notice>

When you look at the files in the *Save changes* modal, you can see a three-dot icon at the top right of each *File Card*. This is the file *Context Menu*, containing a set of file actions that may be useful before you save your changes.

Depending on your *Site* configuration, the *Context Menu* will contain different options. For this guide, your *CloudCannon Configuration File* should have the following options:

* *Data Editor* — Open the file in the CloudCannon Data Editor.
* *Source Editor* — Open the file in the CloudCannon Data Editor.
* *View diff* — Review unsaved changes for a file in text format, with deleted content highlighted in red and new content highlighted in green.
* *Discard unsaved changes* — Discard all unsaved changes to a file.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Save-Changes-Modal-Context-Menu" alt="A screenshot of the Save Changes modal shows unsaved changes from multiple people and an open Context Menu with file actions." title="The Save Changes modal" type="screenshot"/>

At the top left of each file Card is a checkbox, which controls whether the *Save* button will save changes to that file back to your Git repository. If you don't want to affect a particular file, you can untick the checkbox.

Click the *Save selected* button. CloudCannon will commit the changes to the selected files to your Git repository.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  We recommend saving the changes to your Site often, as this keeps your Git repository up to date.
</comp.Notice>

And that's it! Your *Site* is all set up for WYSIWYG editing. In the next step of this guide, we'll direct you to resources for further configuration or user guides on how to edit your files in CloudCannon.
