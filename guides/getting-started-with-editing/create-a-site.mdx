description: Learn about Sites on CloudCannon and how to create your first Site.
---
A *Site* is where you see, edit, and review all your website files. *Sites* are core to your CloudCannon experience and are where you and your content teams will spend the majority of your time.

The features of a *Site* are likely why you are looking for a CMS in the first place. *Sites* allow you to:

* See all your files in user-friendly editing interfaces, without the need to know Markdown, HTML, or Git.
* Organize files to create a more intuitive experience for your content creators.
* Create review processes for saving changes to your content.
* Track the who, when, and why for each change to your website.

In this step of the guide, we'll create your first *Site* by syncing your website files to CloudCannon from your Git repository and point out important UI during a tour of your new *Site*.

## Using a Git provider

When you create a *Site*, CloudCannon first needs to sync your website files from their current location. This could be your local computer storage, or a Git repository maintained using one of CloudCannon's supported Git providers: <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-github-repository-as-your-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-gitlab-respository-as-your-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitLab</a>, or <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-bitbucket-respository-as-your-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitbucket</a>.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  We highly recommend using a Git provider for better security, version control, and collaboration.
</comp.Notice>

This guide will cover how to create a *Site* from files stored in a Git repository.

## Create your first Site

Let's walk through how to authenticate your Git provider, select a repository and branch, name your *Site*, and sync your files. If you already have at least one *Site* on CloudCannon and are using this guide to create another, most of the instructions will be the same; however, some pages or UI may look different.

In the previous step of this guide, we introduced you to your *Organization Home* page and the *Getting Started: Setting up your Organization* in-app guide. The next task in this guide is *Create a Site*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Organization-Home-Create-A-Site-Task" alt="A screenshot of the Create a Site task from the Getting Started in-app guide shows the Create your first Site button." title="The Create a Site task" type="ui-snippet"/>

Click the *Create your first Site* button. CloudCannon will open the *Create a Site* page.

Here, you can use the *File source* dropdown to select your Git provider.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Create-a-Site-Source-Dropdown" alt="A screenshot of the Create a Site page shows a dropdown to select your File Source from a Git repository, local storage, or a template." title="The Create a Site page" type="screenshot"/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p>If you already have one or more <em>Sites</em> associated with your <em>Organization</em>, the <em>Create a Site</em> task may not appear on your <em>Organization Home</em> page. Instead, click the <em>Sites</em> button in the <em>App Sidebar</em> to open the <em>Sites Browser</em>. You can add a new Site to CloudCannon using the <em>+ Create a Site</em> button at the top right of the <em>Sites Browser</em>.</p><comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Sites-Browser-One-Site" alt="A screenshot of the Sites Browsers shows one Site and the + Create a Site button in the top right." title="The Sites Browser" type="screenshot"/>

### Authenticate your Git provider

For CloudCannon to sync your files, you must give it permission to access your Git provider. You can see which Git providers are authenticated by a green shield icon next to the option in the *File source* dropdown.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Create-a-Site-Authenticated-GitHub" alt="A screenshot of the list of Git providers shows the green shield icon indicating that Git Hub is authenticated through CloudCannon." title="Git provider authenticated badge" type="ui-snippet"/>

When you select an unauthenticated Git provider using the *File source* dropdown, CloudCannon will show you the *Authenticate* button.

Click this button and CloudCannon will forward you to your Git provider login screen. Follow your Git provider's instructions to authenticate access, then return to the *Create a Site* page on CloudCannon.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Create-a-Site-Authenticate-GitHub" alt="A screenshot of the Create a Site page shows an Authenticate button to approve CloudCannon's access to GitHub." title="The Create a Site page" type="screenshot"/>

You only need to authenticate your Git provider once; CloudCannon will remember it for all other *Sites* you create.

### Select your repository and branch

Once you have selected an authenticated Git provider using the *File source* dropdown, the *Create a Site* page will show a *Repository* dropdown and *Branch Setup* section. The *Repository* dropdown will list all the available repositories from your authenticated Git provider account.

Select the correct repository from the list. You can type in the *Repository* text field to filter your options, if necessary.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Create-a-Site-Repository-Dropdown" alt="A screenshot of the Create a Site page shows the Repository dropdown with several options." title="The Create a Site page" type="screenshot"/>

As a Git-based CMS, CloudCannon uses branching for better security and version control, as well as to enable your team to work on updates in parallel. Each *Site* on CloudCannon is connected to a branch of your Git repository.

Use the *Branch setup* radio buttons to select either *Use an existing branch* or *Create a new branch*. You will most likely want to use an existing branch, but if you want to try CloudCannon without impacting your existing work, you can create a new one.

If you select *Use an existing branch*, use the *Branch* dropdown to select a branch from your repository.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Create-a-Site-Existing-Branch-Dropdown" alt="A screenshot of the Create a Site page shows the Use an existing branch radio button and the Branch dropdown." title="The Create a Site page" type="screenshot"/>

If you select *Create a new branch*, use the *Source branch* dropdown to select which branch from your repository to copy and enter a name for your new branch in the *New branch name* text field.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Create-a-Site-New-Branch" alt="A screenshot of the Create a Site page shows the Create a new branch radio button, Source branch, and New branch name fields." title="The Create a Site page" type="screenshot"/>

### Name your Site

The *Site name* text field determines the name for your *Site* in CloudCannon. This won't affect your repository or branch in your Git provider.

CloudCannon will automatically populate this field with the name of your repository, but you can choose any name for your *Site*. We recommend choosing a simple name that provides information about the purpose of the Site (e.g., "CloudCannon Marketing Website", "Production: CloudCannon Documentation", "Staging: CloudCannon Documentation").

Use the *Site name* field to add a name for your *Site*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Create-a-Site-Page-Complete" alt="A screenshot of the Create a Site page shows all fields are complete." title="The Create a Site page" type="screenshot"/>

Click the *Create Site and start syncing* button at the bottom of the page.

### CloudCannon will sync your files

CloudCannon will begin syncing your files from your Git provider and open your *Site Dashboard*.

On your *Site Dashboard*, you'll see another in-app guide: *Getting Started with Editing*. This guide focuses on setting up the basics of your *Site.*

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Add-Files" alt="A screenshot of the Site Dashboard shows the Getting Started with Editing guide with a task to Add your Files." title="The Site Dashboard" type="screenshot"/>

The first task in the *Getting Started with Editing* in-app guide is to *Add your files*. As CloudCannon is already syncing your files from your Git repository, you should see an in progress message under this step. This process is usually quick, but it may take a few minutes for larger repositories.

Once CloudCannon has finished syncing, this step of the guide will update and allow you to mark the task as complete.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Add-Your-Files-Task" alt="A screenshot of the Add your Files task from the Getting Started with Editing in-app guide shows the Mark as complete button." title="The Add your Files task" type="ui-snippet"/>

In the next step of this guide, we'll look at your new *Site* and introduce you to some important UI.
