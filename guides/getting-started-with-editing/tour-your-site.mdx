description: Take a guided tour around the new Site you have made in CloudCannon.
---
The next task in the *Getting Started with Editing* in-app guide is *Tour your new Site*, which points out important UI on your new *Site*. If you would rather continue configuring CloudCannon, feel free to skip this task.

Your *Site Dashboard* is the homepage for your *Site*. At this stage, your *Site* might look a little empty. Don't worry, we'll walk through how to configure each element, allowing you to craft an experience that works best for you and your team.

On the left, you can see the *App sidebar* in blue. This is the same as in the previous step of this guide (when we showed you the *Organization Home* page). If you ever navigate away from your Site and need to find it again, click the *Sites* button in your *App sidebar* to open your *Sites Browser*. This page will list all the *Sites* in your *Organization*, and includes filtering and sorting options to help you find specific *Sites*.

At the top of your screen is the *Site Header* in gray. This section displays key information about your Site in the top left, such as your *Site* icon, name, and branch, and important tools in the top right, such as the *Avatars* of all the team members viewing a *Site* and the *Save* button.

More tools will appear in your *Site Header* as you set up your *Site*. We'll go through what all these tools do in the later steps of this guide.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Header-Empty" alt="A screenshot of an empty Site Header UI element shows the Site icon, name, branch, Avatar list, and Save button." title="An empty Site Header" type="ui-snippet"/>

On the left of your screen, just in from the *App sidebar*, is your *Site Navigation* in gray. For now, your *Site Navigation* will just have a link to your *Dashboard* at the top, and two *Developer* links at the bottom for your *File Browser* and *Site Settings*. Once we have configured your *Site* further, more links will appear in the *Site Navigation*.

Try clicking the link to your *File Browser*. As you can see, CloudCannon has synced all your files from your Git repository.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-File-Browser-No-Config" alt="A screenshot of the File Browser shows that CloudCannon has synced all files from a Git repository." title="The File Browser" type="screenshot"/>

When you are ready to return to your *Site* *Dashboard*, click the *Dashboard* link in your *Site Navigation*. You can always tell which page you are on by which link is highlighted in the *Site Navigation*.

Finally, the majority of your screen is your *Site* *Dashboard* page, which acts as a hub for key information about your Site. The *Dashboard* is broken down into several tabs, including *Summary*, *Activity*, *Syncs*, and *Guides*. You can click on these tabs to navigate between them.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-New-Site-Dashboard-Tabs" alt="A screenshot of the Site Dashboard tabs on a new Site shows the Summary, Activity, Syncs, and Guides tabs." title="The Site Dashboard Tabs" type="ui-snippet"/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p>Depending on the configuration of your <em>Site</em>, more tabs, like <em>Builds</em> and <em>Build Deploys</em>, can appear on your <em>Site Dashboard</em>.</p>
</comp.Notice>

On the *Summary* tab of your *Site Dashboard*, CloudCannon will display summary information about your Site. For new Sites, CloudCannon has the *Getting Started with Editing* in-app guide in the centre, with suggested tasks for configuring your Site. Underneath the in-app guide is a list of your recent activity. On the right, The *Summary* tab also gives a preview of your most recent sync.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Tour-Site-Task" alt="A screenshot of the Site Dashboard shows the Getting Started tasklist with a task to Tour your new Site." title="The Site Dashboard" type="ui-snippet"/>

On the *Activity* tab of your *Site Dashboard*, CloudCannon will show you a list of recent activity on your *Site* in reverse chronological order. This list refreshes every time you sync your *Site* or update your *Site Settings*. This list includes:

* Every change made to your files from within CloudCannon or your Git provider (including the author, date, time, and commit message, if applicable).
* When your *Site* has Syncing or Output errors.
* Any changes made to your *Site Settings*, or *Branch* and *Publish Branch* settings.

For now, the *Activity* tab will only have two items: you creating the *Site* and syncing your files!

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-New-Site-Dashboard-Activity-Tab" alt="A screenshot of the Activity tab on the Site Dashboard shows two activity item." title="The Activity tab" type="screenshot"/>

On the *Syncs* tab of your *Site Dashboard*, CloudCannon will show you a list of syncing logs for your Site in reverse chronological order. Right now, there is only one Sync log.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-New-Site-Dashboard-Syncs-Tab" alt="A screenshot of the Syncs tab on the Site Dashboard shows one Sync log." title="The Syncs tab" type="screenshot"/>

On the *Guides* tab of your *Site Dashboard*, CloudCannon will show you a list of in-app guides. Right now, we are working through *Getting Started with Editing*. There are several other guides you can follow to configure other features in CloudCannon after you have finished *Getting Started with Editing*. We'll talk about those guides later in the [More resources](/documentation/guides/getting-started-with-editing/more-resources/) step of this guide.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-New-Site-Dashboard-Guides-Tab" alt="A screenshot of the Guides tab on the Site Dashboard shows one active guide and several other available guides." title="The Guides tab" type="screenshot"/>

In the next step of this guide, we'll start working on the *Getting started with Editing* in-app guide for your Site, including creating your *CloudCannon Configuration File*.
