  Learn about Collections in CloudCannon, including what they are and how to add
  them.

A major benefit of using a CMS is the ability to organize your files in a user-friendly interface for easy browsing.

In CloudCannon, you can group the files you want to edit into *Collections* (groups of similar files stored in the same folder of your website, e.g., a folder of pages, blog posts, product descriptions, or data files). Then, you can view, sort, filter, and scroll through all your files in a *Collection browser* by clicking on the name of a *Collection* in your *Site Navigation*.

Let's complete the next task in the *Getting Started with Editing* in-app guide: *Group your files into Collections*. As part of this task, we'll also learn about *Configuration Mode*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Add-Collections-Task" alt="A screenshot of the Add a Collection task from the Getting Started task list." title="The Add a Collection task" type="ui-snippet"/>

## What is *Configuration Mode*?

*Configuration Mode* is a tool for updating the configuration of your *Site*. The *Configuration Mode* switch on the right of your *Site Header* allows you to toggle *Configuration Mode* on and off.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Header-Tools" alt="A screenshot of the Site Header tools shows the Avatar List, Configuration Mode toggle, and the Save button with one unsaved change." title="The Site Header tools" type="ui-snippet"/>

When *Configuration Mode* is on, CloudCannon will display *Edit configuration* buttons next to each element of the app you can configure. These *Edit configuration* buttons are all in purple, making them easy to find and visually distinct from other UI elements.

When Configuration Mode is off, CloudCannon hides all the *Edit configuration* buttons, creating an uncluttered interface for content creators. We recommend spending most of your time with Configuration Mode off for a better editing experience, but you can always turn it on to make a quick change your Site configuration.

Clicking on one of the *Edit configuration* buttons will open a modal or data panel with fields for configuring the UI element. You will be able to see any visual changes in CloudCannon in real time, and all your changes will be added to your *CloudCannon Configuration File*.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p><strong>Who can use Configuration Mode?</strong></p><p>Turning on Configuration Mode only affects the way your Site looks for you; the purple <em>Edit configuration</em> buttons do not appear for other users of your Site.</p><p>You can restrict the capacity to use Configuration Mode to specific team members using permissions, which we cover in the <a href="/documentation/guides/add-your-team-to-cloudcannon/">Add your team to CloudCannon</a> guide. We recommend you check out this guide after you have finished Getting Started.</p>

## Editing your *Collections* using *Configuration Mode*

x

Turn on *Configuration Mode* using the switch on the right of the *Site Header*. The *\+ Edit Collections* button will appear in the *Site Navigation.*

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-No-Collections" alt="A screenshot of the Site Dashboard shows the Getting Started task list and a purple Add Collections button in the Site Navigation." title="The Site Dashboard" type="screenshot"/>

When you click the *\+ Edit Collections* button, CloudCannon will open the *Edit Collections* modal.

Adding your Collections is the next task on your *Getting started* task list. Let's add one.

##

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If you need to add more Collections to your Site in the future, the *\+Add Collections* button will appear in the *Site Navigation* whenever you turn on Configuration Mode.
</comp.Notice>

Click on the *\+ Add Collections* button. CloudCannon will open the *Add Collections* modal.

There are two ways to add Collections to your Site. CloudCannon will detect potential Collections in your website files. You can choose any number of these detected Collections, or create a custom Collection by manually entering a few initial details.

Regardless of your chosen method, CloudCannon will convert your answers to YAML and add them to your Configuration File under the `collections_config` key. You can expand the *Additional content for `/cloudcannon.config.yml`* dropdown at the bottom of the *Add Collections* modal to see the content CloudCannon will add to your file.

Here's an example of what that configuration code might look like:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````

collections_config:
  news:
    path: /blog/news/
    icon: breaking_news

``````````
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

###

When you are happy with your configuration, click the *\+ Add Collection* button at the bottom of the modal.

## Tour your *Collection Browser*

Let's take a tour of your new Collections and point out some important UI. If you would rather continue configuring CloudCannon, feel free to skip straight to the next step in this guide.

Click on a Collection in your *Site Navigation* to open the *Collection Browser*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Navigation-New-Collections" alt="A screenshot of the Site Navigation shows that several Collections are now present." title="The Site Navigation" type="ui-snippet"/>

You may notice that several UI elements in your *Collections Browser* are purple. That's because these elements are all configurable, allowing you to customize your CloudCannon experience.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Configuration-Mode-On" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows several UI elements highlighted in Configuration Mode purple." title="The Collection Browser" type="screenshot"/>

For now, let's hide this UI by clicking on the purple *Configuration Mode* *switch* on the right of your *Site Header* to turn it off. We'll discuss Configuration Mode more in the [next step of this guide](/documentation/guides/getting-started-with-editing/check-out-dev-mode/).

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Header-Tools" alt="A screenshot of the Site Header tools shows the Avatar List, Configuration Mode toggle, and the Save button with one unsaved change." title="The Site Header tools" type="ui-snippet"/>

Your *Collection Browser* allows you to browse, sort, and filter your Collection files.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Unconfigured-Collection" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows several tools for browsing, sorting, and filtering your Collection files." title="The Collection Browser" type="screenshot"/>

At the top left of your *Collection Browser*, underneath your *Site Header*, is the name of your Collection. This will be the same as the Collection name in the *Site Navigation*.

Under the Collection name are the *Collection Browser controls*: the *Change sorting* *menu*, *Change view* *menu*, *Filter* text field, and the *\+ Add menu*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser controls shows the Change sorting menu, Change view menu, Filter text field, and the + Add menu." title="The Collection Browser controls" type="ui-snippet"/>

The *Change sorting* *menu* allows you to change how CloudCannon sorts your Collection files. By default, you can sort your files alphabetically by file path, or numerically by file size, date and time of file creation, or date and time the file was last modified.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls-Sort-Dropdown" alt="A screenshot of the Change sorting menu in the Collection Browser shows a dropdown with several options for sorting Collection files." title="The Change sorting menu" type="ui-snippet"/>

The *Change view* *menu* allows you to change how your files appear in the *Collection Browser*. You can switch between three view options: *List*, *Cards*, and *Gallery*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls-View-Dropdown" alt="A screenshot of the Change view menu in the Collection Browser shows a dropdown with several options for Collection file appearance." title="The Change view menu" type="ui-snippet"/>

The default view in your *Collection Browser* is the *Gallery* view. When the *Gallery* view option is selected, the *Collection Browser*  displays the file name, file path, the icon for the Collection, and has a gallery section for each file in a rectangular Card. The gallery section of the Card can display an image from within the file or a preview screenshot of the webpage.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-View-Gallery" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows files in Gallery view, with an image section for each file." title="The Collection Browser in Gallery view" type="screenshot"/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p>The gallery section of your file Card can also display a "No preview available" or "Failed to load image" warning.</p><p>"No preview available" indicates that the preview screenshot has not been configured. This will be the case for Sites that have not been built. We'll cover screenshots more in the <a href="/documentation/guides/getting-started-with-editing/choose-building-or-headless/">Choose building or headless</a> step of this guide.</p><p>"Failed to load image" indicates that an error has occurred, and CloudCannon could not load the preview screenshot. Refreshing your browser may fix this.</p>
</comp.Notice>

When the *Card* view option is selected, the *Collection Browser* displays the file name, file path, and the icon for the Collection for each file in a rectangular Card. This is similar to the *Gallery* view, except without a section for an image.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-View-Card" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows files in Card view." title="The Collection Browser in Card view" type="screenshot"/>

When the *List* view option is selected, the *Collection Browser* displays the file name, file path, and the icon for the Collection for each file in a horizontal Card.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-View-List" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows files in List view." title="The Collection Browser in List view" type="screenshot"/>

By typing in the *Filter* text field, you can filter your Collection files to show file paths that match a given string.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls-Filtered-Files" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows that a text string in the Collection Filter has filtered the files shown." title="The Collection Browser" type="screenshot"/>

The *\+ Add* button allows you to add new files and folders to a Collection, which you can save back to your Git repository.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls-Add-Menu-Dropdown" alt="A screenshot of the + Add menu in the Collection Browser shows a dropdown with options to add a new file or folder." title="The + Add menu" type="ui-snippet"/>

In the next step of this guide, we'll cover Configuration Mode, including what it does and how to enable it.
