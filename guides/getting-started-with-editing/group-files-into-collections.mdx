  Learn about Collections in CloudCannon, including what they are and how to add
  them.

A major benefit of using a CMS is the ability to organize your files in a user-friendly interface for easy browsing.

In CloudCannon, you can group the files you want to edit into *Collections* (groups of similar files stored in the same folder of your website, e.g., a folder of pages, blog posts, product descriptions, or data files). Then, you can view, sort, filter, and scroll through all your files in a *Collection browser* by clicking on the name of a *Collection* in your *Site Navigation*.

Let's complete the next task in the *Getting Started with Editing* in-app guide: *Group your files into Collections*. As part of this task, we'll also learn about *Configuration Mode*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Add-Collections-Task" alt="A screenshot of the Add a Collection task from the Getting Started task list." title="The Add a Collection task" type="ui-snippet"/>

## What is *Configuration Mode*?

*Configuration Mode* is a tool for updating the configuration of your *Site*. The *Configuration Mode* switch on the right of your *Site Header* allows you to toggle *Configuration Mode* on and off.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Header-Tools" alt="A screenshot of the Site Header tools shows the Avatar List, Configuration Mode toggle, and the Save button with one unsaved change." title="The Site Header tools" type="ui-snippet"/>

When *Configuration Mode* is on, CloudCannon will display *Edit configuration* buttons next to each element of the app you can configure. These *Edit configuration* buttons are all in purple, making them easy to find and visually distinct from other UI elements.

When Configuration Mode is off, CloudCannon hides all the *Edit configuration* buttons, creating an uncluttered interface for content creators. We recommend spending most of your time with Configuration Mode off for a better editing experience, but you can always turn it on to make a quick change your Site configuration.

Clicking on one of the *Edit configuration* buttons will open a modal or data panel with fields for configuring the UI element. You will be able to see any visual changes in CloudCannon in real time, and all your changes will be added to your *CloudCannon Configuration File*.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p><strong>Who can use Configuration Mode?</strong></p>

  <p>Turning on Configuration Mode only affects the way your Site looks for you; the purple <em>Edit configuration</em> buttons do not appear for other users of your Site.</p><p>You can restrict the capacity to use Configuration Mode to specific team members using permissions, which we cover in the <a href="/documentation/guides/add-your-team-to-cloudcannon/">Add your team to CloudCannon</a> guide. We recommend you check out this guide after you have finished Getting Started.</p>

## Editing your *Collections* using *Configuration Mode*

*Collections* appear in your *Site Navigation* for easy access; the *\+ Edit Collections* button is also in your *Site Navigation* and is visible when you turn on *Configuration Mode*.

Click the *Configuration Mode* switch on the right of the *Site Header* to turn it on. Purple *Edit configuration* buttons will appear in several places across the CloudCannon UI, including the *Edit Collections* button will appear in the *Site Navigation.*

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-No-Collections" alt="A screenshot of the Site Dashboard shows the Getting Started task list and a purple Add Collections button in the Site Navigation." title="The Site Dashboard" type="screenshot"/>

Click on the *Edit Collections* button to open the *Edit Collections* modal.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-CloudCannon-Documentation-Add-Collections-Modal" alt="A screenshot of the Edit Collections modal shows a tree structure of potential Collections detected from your files." title="The Edit Collections modal" type="screenshot"/>

When you synced your files to your *Site*, CloudCannon detected which folders contain files you might want to edit. These folders are presented in a tree structure in the *Edit Collections* modal. You can click on any folders highlighted in blue to expand them further.

Each folder has four details: the *Path* of the folder in your repository, a *Display Name* and *Icon*, and a *Key*. CloudCannon has selected default for these values, but you can update them later (we cover this in the [Configure your Collections](/documentation/guides/configure-your-collections/) guide).

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Add-Collections-Modal-Select-Collections" alt="A screenshot of the Edit Collections modal shows that three Collections are selected." title="The Edit Collections modal" type="screenshot"/>

The *Collection Path* appears at the top of each folder in the tree structure, and is relative to the *Source Folder* you defined in the previous step of this guide, [Create your CloudCannon Configuration File](/documentation/guides/getting-started-with-editing/create-your-cloudcannon-configuration-file/). Each *Collection* must have a unique file *Path*.

At the bottom each folder, next to the key symbol, is the *Collection* *Key*. The *Key* is derived from your *Collection Path*, and will be used to store all your *Collection* configuration options in the *CloudCannon Configuration File*. Each *Collection* must have a unique *Key*.

Lastly, each *Collection* has a *Display Name* and *Icon*. The *Collection Display Name* is the *Key* in title case form (i.e., `travel_blog` becomes "Travel Blog"). The *Icon* comes from [Google's Material Symbols and Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Symbols&amp;icon.style=Rounded) and, by default, is the one with the most similar name to the *Collection* *Key*. These details will appear in your *Site Navigation* when you add the *Collection*.

Select the *Collections* you want using the checkboxes next to each folder. When you select a folder, CloudCannon will show you how many files are in each *Collection*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Add-Collections-Modal-Detected-Collection" alt="A screenshot of a selected Collection from the Edit Collections modal shows a file path, key, name, icon, and how many files are included." title="A selected Collection" type="ui-snippet"/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  &nbsp;

  **What happens when you select one** ***Collection*** **nested inside of another?**

  Files can only belong to one *Collection* at a time. If you select two *Collections*, one nested inside another, the files will appear in the *Collection* with the most specific *Path*.

  Let's walk through an example.

  <comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/guides/getting-started/2025-09/CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-File-Structure.png" alt="An illustration of a file structure shows a blog folder with two nested files and a nested authors folder, which also has two nested files." title="An example file structure" type="ui-snippet"/>

  Assume you have an `authors` folder nested in your `blog` folder (i.e., `/blog/authors/`). The `authors` folder contains non-output data files with profile information about your various blog authors. In addition to the `authors` folder, the `blog` folder also contains all your output blog files. In this case, both the `authors` and `blog` folders could be *Collections*.

  If you only add the "Blog" *Collection* with the path `/blog/`, all your output blog files will belong to this *Collection*, but so will all the data files inside `/blog/authors/`. All these files will appear as a sub-folder in your Blog *Collection Browser*.

  Adding the "Blog" *Collection* and the "Authors" *Collection* will separate these files, keeping your output blog files in one *Collection Browser* and your non-output data files in another.

  &nbsp;

</comp.Notice>

Like the *Create my Configuration File* modal in the previous step, you can click on the *Show changes* button in the bottom left to preview the contents you are adding to your *CloudCannon Configuration File*.

Here's an example of what that configuration code might look like:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````

collections_config:
  news:
    path: /blog/news/
    icon: breaking_news

``````````
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

When you are happy with your selection, click the *\+ Add Collection* button at the bottom of the modal. Your *Collections* will appear in the *Site Navigation*!

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p>If you need to add or remove <em>Collections</em> in the future, the <em>Edit Collections</em> button will appear in the <em>Site Navigation</em> whenever you turn on <em>Configuration Mode</em>.</p><comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Add-Collections-Modal-Change-Collections" alt="A screenshot of the Edit Collections modal shows one existing Collection and one unselected Collection with the Remove badge." title="The Edit Collections modal" type="ui-snippet"/>
</comp.Notice>

Mark the *Group your files into Collections* task as complete when you are ready to move on.

## Tour a *Collection Browser*

This next task in the *Getting Started with Editing* in-app guide is *Tour a Collection Browser*, which will point out important UI in the *Collection Browser*. If you would rather continue configuring CloudCannon, feel free to skip this task.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-New-Collections" alt="A screenshot of the Site Dashboard shows several UI elements highlighted in Configuration Mode purple." title="The Site Dashboard" type="screenshot"/>

The *Collections* you selected in the *Edit Collections* modal are visible in your *Site Navigation*. Click on a *Collection* to open the *Collection Browser*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Navigation-New-Collections" alt="A screenshot of the Site Navigation shows that several Collections are now present." title="The Site Navigation" type="ui-snippet"/>

You may notice that several UI elements in your *Collections Browser* are purple. That's because these elements are all configurable, allowing you to customize your CloudCannon experience using *Configuration Mode*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Configuration-Mode-On" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows several UI elements highlighted in Configuration Mode purple." title="The Collection Browser" type="screenshot"/>

For now, let's hide this UI by clicking on the purple *Configuration Mode* switch on the right of your *Site Header* to turn it off. We'll discuss cover configuration for your *Collections* in the [Configure your Collections](/documentation/guides/configure-your-collections/) guide.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Header-Tools" alt="A screenshot of the Site Header tools shows the Avatar List, Configuration Mode toggle, and the Save button with one unsaved change." title="The Site Header tools" type="ui-snippet"/>

Your *Collection Browser* allows you to browse, sort, and filter your *Collection* files, add new ones, and perform file actions like cloning or deleting.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Unconfigured-Collection" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows several tools for browsing, sorting, and filtering your Collection files." title="The Collection Browser" type="screenshot"/>

At the top of your *Collection Browser*, underneath your *Site Header*, is the *Collection Header*. This section contains important identifying information about your *Collection*, such as the *Name*, and *Documentation Link* or *Description* (if configured).

Under the *Collection Header* are the *Collection Browser Controls*: the *Change sorting* *menu*, *Change view* *menu*, *Filter* text field, and the *\+ Add menu*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser controls shows the Change sorting menu, Change view menu, Filter text field, and the + Add menu." title="The Collection Browser controls" type="ui-snippet"/>

The *Sort* menu allows you to change how CloudCannon sorts your Collection files. By default, you can sort your files alphabetically by file path, or numerically by file size, date and time of file creation, or date and time the file was last modified.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls-Sort-Dropdown" alt="A screenshot of the Change sorting menu in the Collection Browser shows a dropdown with several options for sorting Collection files." title="The Change sorting menu" type="ui-snippet"/>

The *Change view* *menu* allows you to change how your files appear in the *Collection Browser*. You can switch between three view options: *List*, *Cards*, and *Gallery*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls-View-Dropdown" alt="A screenshot of the Change view menu in the Collection Browser shows a dropdown with several options for Collection file appearance." title="The Change view menu" type="ui-snippet"/>

The default view in your *Collection Browser* is the *Gallery* view. When the *Gallery* view option is selected, the *Collection Browser* displays the file name, file path (if it is an output *Collection*), the icon for the *Collection*, and has a gallery section for each file in a rectangular Card. The gallery section of the Card can display an image from within the file or a preview screenshot of the webpage.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-View-Gallery" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows files in Gallery view, with an image section for each file." title="The Collection Browser in Gallery view" type="screenshot"/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p>The gallery section of your file Card can also display a "No preview available" or "Failed to load image" warning.</p><p>"No preview available" indicates that the preview screenshot has not been configured. This will be the case for Sites that have not been built. We'll cover screenshots more in the <a href="/documentation/guides/getting-started-with-editing/choose-building-or-headless/">Choose building or headless</a> step of this guide.</p><p>"Failed to load image" indicates that an error has occurred, and CloudCannon could not load the preview screenshot. Refreshing your browser may fix this.</p>
</comp.Notice>

When the *Card* view option is selected, the *Collection Browser* displays the file name, file path, and the icon for the Collection for each file in a rectangular Card. This is similar to the *Gallery* view, except without a section for an image.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-View-Card" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows files in Card view." title="The Collection Browser in Card view" type="screenshot"/>

When the *List* view option is selected, the *Collection Browser* displays the file name, file path, and the icon for the Collection for each file in a horizontal Card.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-View-List" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows files in List view." title="The Collection Browser in List view" type="screenshot"/>

By typing in the *Filter* text field, you can filter your Collection files to show file paths that match a given string.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls-Filtered-Files" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows that a text string in the Collection Filter has filtered the files shown." title="The Collection Browser" type="screenshot"/>

The *\+ Add* button allows you to add new files and folders to a Collection, which you can save back to your Git repository.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls-Add-Menu-Dropdown" alt="A screenshot of the + Add menu in the Collection Browser shows a dropdown with options to add a new file or folder." title="The + Add menu" type="ui-snippet"/>

In the next step of this guide, we'll cover how to edit a file and save those changes back to your Git repository.
