description: Learn about other guides for setting up optional configuration in CloudCannon.

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

By following each step in this guide so far, you have set up a basic WYSIWYG editing for your *Site* on CloudCannon and learnt important skills for managing your content. But there's a lot more to CloudCannon that we haven't covered yet.

While technically optional, we highly recommend reading through these other guides to figure out which configuration you need.

You can complete these guides in any order, but here's the order we suggest:

* [Configure your Collections](/documentation/guides/configure-your-collections/) â€” Configure how your Collections look and function, including file Card appearance, how CloudCannon adds new files, what editing interfaces Collections should use, and what URL file should output to.
* [Set up Visual Editing](/documentation/guides/set-up-visual-editing/) â€”

Most of these guides have in-app counterparts. You can find a complete list of guides that configure your *Site* (rather than your *Organization*) under the *Guides* tab on your *Site Dashboard*. You can also see your current in-app guide on the *Summary* tab by marking it as active.
