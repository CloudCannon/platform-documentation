  Learn a few tips for adding Editable Regions to your files and some common
  errors that cause misconfigured Editable Regions.
---
Congratulations! You now have everything you need to start adding *Editable Regions* to your *Site* on CloudCannon. Here are a few tips and common errors to help your visual editing journey.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to our friendly [support team](/support/).

## Best practices and tips

### Preserve Your Existing Structure

When adding *Editable Regions* to your website files, you don't need to change your file structure or data format. The HTML attributes should work with your existing layouts and HTML-like files, and web components should slot into your files with minimal interruption.

You don't need to change your existing markdown or front matter.

### Migrate gradually

You can easily add a few *Editable Regions* for key fields, then gradually add more as needed.

### SEO considerations

Adding *Editable Regions* to your files will not affect your Search Engine Optimization (SEO). For example, this will still render correctly for search engines:

<comp.CodeBlock language="HTML">
``````````

<meta name="description" content={frontmatter.description} />
<h1><text-editable data-prop="title">{frontmatter.title}</text-editable></h1>

``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

## Common errors

If you accidentally misconfigure your *Editable Regions*, CloudCannon will display a red warning box in the Visual Editor.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

These warnings will tell you which error you have encountered. Here are a few common errors:

* You did not define the `data-prop` HTML attribute.
* The *Editable Region* has an invalid data type (e.g., your Text region has a number or object, instead of a string).
* Non-existent component references
* Malformed data paths

### Array *Editable Regions*

* Non-array data types
* You have one or more orphaned Array Item *Editable Regions* that are not contained within an Array *Editable Region*.

### Component *Editable Regions*

* Missing `data-component` attribute
* Non-existent component registrations
* Component rendering errors
* Invalid component return values

### Image *Editable Regions*

* Missing `<img>` child element
* Upload failures

### Source *Editable Regions*

* You did not define the `data-path` HTML attribute.
* You did not define the `data-key` HTML attribute.
* The file path defined by `data-path` does not exist.
* There are *Editable Regions* with the same `data-key` value. This value should be unique.

### Text *Editable Regions*

* You have an unsupported value for `data-type`. It must be `span`, `text`, or `block`.
* The file path defined by `data-path` does not exist.
