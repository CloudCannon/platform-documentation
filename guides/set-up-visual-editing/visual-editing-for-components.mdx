  Learn how to configure Editable Regions for Astro or React components, 
  allowing you to edit them in the Visual Editor.
---
<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  <p>Currently, Component <em>Editable Regions</em> are only available for Astro and React. We are working to support more types. Please get in touch with our friendly <a href="/support/">support team</a> to make a request.</p>
</comp.Notice>

Depending on your SSG, you may use predefined components on your webpages.

In this step of the guide, we'll cover how to add *Editable Regions* to components.

## What is a component?

A component is a resuable piece of code, ranging from a small snippet of HTML, like a `<meta>` tag that make SEO easier, to UI elements like a header, profile card, or an entire page layout.

Because components render to HTML at build time, you can edit them in the Visual Editor.

&nbsp;

Let's take a look at an example.

This file file is the x, containing structured data keys for `hero`, `title`, `tagline`, `roles`, `icon`, and `text`.

<comp.CodeBlock language="Markdown" source="hero.mdx">
``````````

---
hero:
  title: Hello, my name is Heather Scott
  tagline: Creative Developer Portfolio
  roles:
    - icon: code
      text: Developer
    - icon: microphone
      text: Speaker
    - icon: pencil
      text: Writer
---

``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

Here is an excerpt from our Hero Component file, defining the layout of the component with HTML and templating.

<comp.CodeBlock language="Astro" source="HeroComponent.astro">
``````````

<div>
	<div>
		<h1>{title}</h1>
		{tagline && <p>{tagline}</p>}
	</div>
	<slot />
</div>

``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

Together, these files output a webpage that looks like this:

<comp.DocsImage path="" alt="" title=""/>

In this example, we want to be able to edit the text and array in the Hero Component using the Visual Editor.

## Install the npm package

Before you can use Component *Editable Regions*, you will need to install CloudCannon's *Editable Regions* NPM package.

With your website project open in your local development environment, run the following command in your terminal:

<comp.CodeBlock language="">
``````````

npm install @cloudcannon/editable-regions

``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

## Register your components

Next, we need to register your components with the NPM package. To do this, you'll need to create a registration script and include it in your layout.

Here's an example registration script for the Hero component.

<comp.CodeBlock language="JavaScript" source="src/scripts/register-components.js">
``````````

import { registerAstroComponent } from '@cloudcannon/editable-regions/integrations/astro.js';
import Hero from '../components/Hero.astro';

// Register your components
registerAstroComponent('hero', Hero);

``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  If you use React components, please use `{ registerReactComponent }` instead.
  
  <comp.CodeBlock language="JavaScript" source="src/scripts/register-components.js">
  ``````````

  import { registerReactComponent } from '@cloudcannon/editable-regions/integrations/react.js';
  import MyComponent from './MyComponent.jsx';

  registerReactComponent('my_component', MyComponent);

  ``````````
  </comp.CodeBlock>
</comp.Notice>

## Using Component *Editable Regions*

<comp.CodeBlock language="Astro" source="Layout.astro">
