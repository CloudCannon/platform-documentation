  Learn how to configure Editable Regions for Astro or React components, 
  allowing you to edit them in the Visual Editor.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  <p>Currently, Component <em>Editable Regions</em> are only available for Astro and React. We are working to support more types. Please get in touch with our friendly <a href="/support/">support team</a> to make a request.</p>
</comp.Notice>

Depending on your SSG, you may use predefined components on your webpages.

Let's complete the next task in the *Set up Visual Editing* in-app guide: *Make your components visually editable*.

In this step of the guide, we'll cover how to add *Editable Regions* to components. If you don't have any appropriate files or don't want to add this type of *Editable Region*, you can skip this step of the guide.

## What is a component?

A component is a resuable piece of code, ranging from a small snippet of HTML, like a `<meta>` tag that make SEO easier, to UI elements like a header, profile card, or an entire page layout. Because components render to HTML at build time, you can edit them in the Visual Editor.

Let's take a look at an example.

Here's our blog post from earlier in the guide. This time we've added a `cta` object to the front matter, containing the structured data keys `description`, `link`, `buttonText`, and `buttonColor`.

<comp.CodeBlock language="Markdown" source="first-post.mdx">

</comp.CodeBlock>

Here's an excerpt from the Blog layout file, containing a Call-To-Action component called `CTA` at the bottom of every blog post.

<comp.CodeBlock language="Astro" source="BlogPost.astro">
``````````

---
import CTA from '../components/CTA.astro';
---

<html lang="en">
	<body>
		<main>
			<article>
                <!-- Blog HTML here -->
			</article>
			<CTA {...Astro.props.cta} /> /*1*/
		</main>
	</body>
</html>

``````````
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  The `<CTA>` component uses structured data in the front matter of the files in the Blog collection.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>

Finally, here's our component layout file, which contains HTML for the component and templating to populate elements with values from each blog file.

<comp.CodeBlock language="Astro" source="components/CTA.astro">
``````````

---
const { description, link, buttonText, buttonColor } = Astro.props;
---

<p>{description}</p>
<a href={link}>
    <button style={`background-color: ${buttonColor}`}>{buttonText}</button>
</a>

``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

Together, these files output a webpage that looks like this:

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/guides/configure-visual-editing/2025-10/CloudCannon-Documentation-Visual-Editing-Guide-CTA-Component.png" alt="A screenshot of a blog page on our Astro website shows a call to action component under the blog content." title="A blog page" type="screenshot"/>

In this example, we want to be able to edit the text for the CTA component description and button inline in the Visual Editor, and be able to open a data panel to edit other values like the link and button color.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  <p>Don't use a Source <em>Editable Region</em> if you have a component in your HTML-like file, as the component will not function correctly in the Visual Editor.</p>
</comp.Notice>

## Install the npm package

Before you can use Component *Editable Regions*, you will need to install CloudCannon's *Editable Regions* NPM package.

With your website project open in your local development environment, run the following command in your terminal:

<comp.CodeBlock language="">
``````````

npm install @cloudcannon/editable-regions

``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

For more information, you can visit CloudCannon's GitHub repository for the [Editable Regions NPM package](https://github.com/CloudCannon/editable-regions).

## Register your components

Next, we need to register your components with the NPM package. To do this, you'll need to create a registration script and include it in your layout.

Here's an example registration script for the CTA component.

<comp.CodeBlock language="JavaScript" source="src/scripts/register-components.js">
``````````

import { registerAstroComponent } from '@cloudcannon/editable-regions/astro';
import CTA from '../components/CTA.astro';

// Register your components
registerAstroComponent('cta', CTA);

``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
                  If you use React components, please use `{ registerReactComponent }` instead.

  <comp.CodeBlock language="JavaScript" source="src/scripts/register-components.js">
                  ``````````
                  import { registerReactComponent } from '@cloudcannon/editable-regions/integrations/react.js';
                  import MyComponent from './MyComponent.jsx';

                  registerReactComponent('my_component', MyComponent);
                  ``````````
                  </comp.CodeBlock>
</comp.Notice>

## Adding Component *Editable Regions*

Let's start with importing the component registration to our layout file.

Inside the `<body>` element of our layout, we can add a `<script>` HTML element with instructions to import the component registration file if the window is in Editor Mode (i.e., your webpage is open in CloudCannon's Visual Editor).

Next, since the `<CTA>` component lacks an appropriate parent DOM element, we should wrap it in the `<editable-component>` web component.

Our Component *Editable Region* needs a `data-prop` to define the path to the data property we want to edit, and a `data-component` to define which registered component we are using. Let's add the HTML attribute `data-prop="cta"`, as `cta` is the key for our object in `first-post.mdx`, and `data-component="cta"`, as `cta` is also the name of the component we registered.

Here's what our Blog Layout code should look like:

<comp.CodeBlock language="Astro" source="BlogPost.astro">
``````````

<html lang="en">
	<body>
        <script> /*1*/
		 	if(window.inEditorMode){
				import '../scripts/register-components.js';
			}
		</script>
		<main>
			<article>
                <!-- Blog HTML here -->
			</article>
			<editable-component data-prop="cta" data-component="cta"> /*2*/
				<CTA {...Astro.props.cta} />
			</editable-component>
		</main>
		<Footer />
	</body>
</html>

``````````
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  The `<script>` element instructs your browser to import the `register-components.js` file if your webpage is open in the Visual Editor.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="2">
  The `editable-component` web component defines a Component *Editable Region*. The `data-prop` attribute defines the path to the data we want to edit, and the `data-component` defines which registered component we are using. In this case, we want to edit the `cta` structured data key in the blog front matter and use the registered component `cta`.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>

Finally, we can add `data-editable` and `data-prop` attributes to define two Text *Editable Regions* for the description and button text data keys. This follows the same steps outlined in the [Visual editing for content files](/documentation/guides/set-up-visual-editing/visual-editing-for-content-files/) step of this guide.

Here's what our CTA component code should look like:

<comp.CodeBlock language="Astro" source="components/CTA.astro">
``````````

---
const { description, link, buttonText, buttonColor } = Astro.props;
---

<p data-editable="text" data-prop="description">{description}</p>
<a href={link}>
    <button data-editable="text" data-prop="buttonText" style={`background-color: ${buttonColor}`}>{buttonText}</button>
</a>

``````````
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  This `<p>` element contains `data-editable="text"` and `data-prop="description"` to define a Text *Editable Region*.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="2">
  This `<button>` element contains `data-editable="text"` and `data-prop="buttonText"` to define a Text *Editable Region*.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>

Once we save and rebuild our *Site*, CloudCannon will show a yellow *Editable Regions* box around all the content inside the `<CTA>` component in the Visual Editor. There are also two Text *Editable Regions* around the description and button text.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Visual-Editor-Component-Editable-Region" alt="A screenshot of the Visual Editor shows a yellow Editable Region box around the Call to Action component on the blog page." title="Component Editable Region in the Visual Editor" type="screenshot"/>

When you click into the *Editable Region*, CloudCannon will open a data panel with inputs for all four structured data keys in the component: `description`, `link`, `buttonText`, and `buttonColor`.
