  Learn about the CloudCannon Visual Editor and the HTML attributes and web
  components you can add to create Editable Regions.
---
CloudCannon has four editing interfaces, each suited to editing different types of files. The Visual Editor is an intuitive interface for any HTML-like files and hybrid files (e.g., `.mdx`) that output to an HTML page on your website. By defining *Editable Regions* on your pages, you can visually edit content in HTML-like layouts, structured data in your front matter, and Markup content.

Let's take a look at some of the basics for *Editable Regions*. If you would rather start configuring your *Site* straight away, feel free to skip to the next step in this guide.

An *Editable Region* in the Visual Editor is signified by a yellow box around a piece of content. Clicking into the *Editable Region* will have a different result depending on the type of content it contains.

## Defining *Editable Regions*

In CloudCannon, defining *Editable Regions* in your files is as simple as adding an HTML attribute to any DOM element or inserting a web component on any file in your website that outputs to HTML. You can make an entire *Collection* of content files visually editable in minutes.

There are five types you can add:

* **Text** — Allows you to edit text values stored in front matter, content, or HTML with plain text or rich text formatting options.
* **Image** — Allows you to upload images from your local storage, select existing images from your repository or DAM, and manage image details like title or alt text.
* **Source** — Allows you to edit rich text stored in HTML.
* **Array** — Allows you to add, remove, and reorder array values stored in front matter and generated by HTML-like files with templating.
* **Component** — Allows you to edit registered Astro or React components.

In this guide, we'll show you how to define each type of *Editable Region* using the following HTML attributes or web components. For a complete list of HTML attributes, please read our [Editable Regions reference](/documentation/articles/editable-regions-reference/) documentation.

In the next step of this guide, we'll cover how to add Text and Image *Editable Regions* to content files containing structured data and Markup, allowing you to edit blogs, product pages, and more in the Visual Editor.
