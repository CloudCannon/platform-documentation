  Learn about Visual Editor, including how CloudCannon generates interactive
  previews of your webpages and how to use editable regions.
---
CloudCannon has four editing interfaces, each suited to different file types: the [Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/the-visual-editor/), the [Content Editor](/documentation/articles/the-content-editor/), the [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/the-data-editor/), and the [Source Editor](/documentation/articles/the-source-editor/). The Visual Editor is perfect for any file that outputs to an HTML webpage at build time.

## Generating the preview of your webpage

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Visual-Editor-Component-Editable-Region" alt="A screenshot of the Visual Editor shows a yellow Editable Region box around the Call to Action component on the blog page." title="Component Editable Region in the Visual Editor" type="screenshot"/>

When you open a file, the Visual Editor displays a preview of your webpage, along with a sidebar on the left. But, where does CloudCannon get the preview?

CloudCannon generates a preview of all your webpages whenever you build your *Site*, allowing you to see the most up-to-date version of your website every time you use the Visual Editor.

A "build" is when CloudCannon converts all your *Site* files into a single, functional website. Building on CloudCannon is optional, but is required for specific features, such as the Visual Editor, preview screenshots for output files in your *Collection Browser*, and the Testing Domain and Custom Domain.

CloudCannon uses a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) system. Every time you trigger a build of your Site, CloudCannon will:

1. Download your files onto our server.
2. Run your selected install commands (e.g., `npm install`, `bundle install`).
3. Run your selected build commands (e.g., `npm run build`).
4. Index your output files.
5. Upload your output files to CloudCannon to generate previews in the Visual Editor, Testing Domain, and *Collection Browser* screenshots, and deliver them to your live Custom Domain (if you are hosting with CloudCannon).

In the [next step of this guide](/documentation/guides/set-up-visual-editing/configure-your-build-settings/), we'll cover how to configure your build settings and complete your first successful build.

## Editing with editable regions or the sidebar
