  Learn about the HTML attributes and web components used to define Editable
  Regions, including best practices for updating your files.
---
*Editable Regions* enable you to define exactly which data should be visually editable. When you update content in an *Editable Region* (or using the data panel or sidebar), CloudCannon will re-render that section of your webpage to keep the preview up to date. It doesn't matter where you store your data; *Editable Regions* work for values in HTML, structured data in front matter or data files, and Markup content.

Defining *Editable Regions* in your files is as simple as adding an HTML attribute to any DOM element (e.g., `<p data-editable="text">`) or inserting a web component on any file in your website that outputs to HTML (e.g., `<editable-text>`). You can make an entire *Collection* of content files visually editable in minutes.

Let's cover some of the basics of *Editable Regions*, including best practices for adding them to your files.

## Types of *Editable Regions*

There are six types of *Editable Region*, each of which can be defined by an HTML attribute or a web component.

* **Source Editable Regions** — Enable you to edit text values stored in HTML, with plain text or rich text formatting options.
* **Text Editable Regions** — Enable you to edit text values stored in structured data files, front matter, or Markup content, with plain text or rich text formatting options.
* **Image Editable Regions** — Enable you to edit image values stored in structured data files or front matter, including uploading images from your local storage, selecting existing images from your repository or DAM, and managing image details like title or alt text.
* **Array and Array Item Editable Regions** — Enable you to edit array values stored in structured data files or front matter, including adding, removing, and reordering array items. You can also nest Text and Image *Editable Regions* inside array items to edit array content.
* **Component Editable Regions** — Enable you to edit registered Astro or React components. You should nest Text and Image *Editable Regions* inside your components to edit component content.

In this guide, we'll show you how to define each type of *Editable Region* using HTML attributes or web components. For a complete list of HTML attributes, please read our [Editable Regions reference](/documentation/articles/editable-regions-reference/) documentation.

## Best practices for defining *Editable Regions*

To avoid common pitfalls, here is a list of best practices for defining *Editable Regions*. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to our friendly [support team](/support/) or start a conversation in the [CloudCannon Community](https://community.cloudcannon.com/).

### Don't change your data structure

When adding *Editable Regions* to your website files, you don't need to change your file structure or data format. *Editable Region* HTML attributes should work seamlessly with your existing layouts and HTML-like files, and web components should integrate into your files with minimal disruption.

Additionally, you can migrate to visual editing gradually by adding a few *Editable Regions* for key values, then adding more as needed.

### Add *Editable Regions* to HTML-like files

Depending on your SSG, the format and extension of the files in your website may differ (e.g., Astro uses `.astro` files, Eleventy uses `.liquid` files). As long as they output to an HTML file after a Site build, you can add *Editable Regions* to any file that contains HTML-like content and templating.

Many websites also have a content *Collection* (e.g., a blog) where each file has front matter and content that populate templating fields in a layout file at build time. You can make the whole *Collection* visually editable by adding *Editable Regions* to the layout file, rather than the content files themselves.

### Start from the root of your file

A key part of defining *Editable Regions* is telling CloudCannon where your data is stored. CloudCannon calculates the path to your data properties relative to parent elements in your file.

To avoid misconfiguration issues where CloudCannon cannot find the data property you want to edit, it is best to start from the values closest to the root of the file (i.e., work from the parent elements to child elements) when you add *Editable Regions* to your files.
