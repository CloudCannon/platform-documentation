&nbsp;

If you have reusable Astro components that you want to make editable, you need to register them first.

## What is a component?

x

## Install and register your components

Before you can use Component *Editable Regions*, you will need to install the NPM package and register your Astro components.

With your website project open in your local development environment, run the following command in your terminal:

<comp.CodeBlock language="">
``````````

npm install @cloudcannon/editables

``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

If this command doesn't work, try the following:

<comp.CodeBlock language="">
``````````

npm i https://github.com/CloudCannon/editables.git

``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

To register your Astro components, you'll need to create a registration script and include it in your layout.

Here's an example registration script for the components `HeroSection` and `TestimonialCard`.

<comp.CodeBlock language="JSX">
``````````
// src/scripts/register-components.js
import { registerAstroComponent } from '@cloudcannon/editables/integrations/astro.js';
import HeroSection from '../components/HeroSection.astro';
import TestimonialCard from '../components/TestimonialCard.astro';

// Register your components
registerAstroComponent('hero_section', HeroSection);
registerAstroComponent('testimonial_card', TestimonialCard);
``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

x

<comp.CodeBlock language="Astro">
``````````
<script>
  import '../scripts/register-components.js';
</script>
``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

### Use Component Editables

Now you can make your components editable:

```markdown
---
title: "Homepage"
hero:
  headline: "Welcome to Our Site"
  subheading: "We build amazing things"
  cta_text: "Get Started"
testimonial:
  quote: "This company is amazing!"
  author: "Happy Customer"
---
```

```astro
<!-- In your page template -->
<component-editable data-prop="hero" data-component="hero_section">
    <HeroSection {...Astro.props.testimonial} />
</component-editable>

<component-editable data-prop="testimonial" data-component="testimonial_card">
    <TestimonialCard {...Astro.props.testimonial} />
</component-editable>
```
