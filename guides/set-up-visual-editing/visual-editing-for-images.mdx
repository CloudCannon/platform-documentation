  Learn how to define Source or Text Editable Regions to edit image values
  stored in HTML or structured data.

Visual editing for images

Image content can be in one of two places: hard-coded in an HTML-like file (e.g., `.astro`, `.liquid`, etc), or stored in a structured data key and referenced by templating in a layout. In these cases, you should use a Source *Editable Region* for the first, and an Image *Editable Region* for the second. Let's cover how to define these.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p><strong>Nested image values</strong></p><p>To avoid misconfiguration errors, it is best practice to define your <em>Editable Regions</em> from the root of your file first (i.e., from parent elements to child elements). If your image values are nested inside an array or a component, you should define <em>Editable</em> <em>Regions</em> for those parent elements first. We'll cover this more in later steps of this guide.</p>

## Common errors

If you accidentally misconfigure your *Editable Regions*, CloudCannon will display a red warning box in the Visual Editor.

Here are a few common errors you might encounter with Source and Text *Editable Regions*:

* You did not define the `data-path` or `data-key` HTML attribute for your Source *Editable Region*, or the `data-prop-*` HTML attribute for your Image *Editable Region*.
* The file path defined by `data-path` does not exist.
* The *Editable Region* has an invalid data type (e.g., your Text region has a number or object, instead of a string).
* There is no `<img>` child element in the Image *Editable Region* web component.
* There are Source *Editable Regions* with the same `data-key` value. This value should be unique.

In the next step of this guide, we'll cover how to define *Editable Regions* for image values stored in HTML-like files or structured data.

Text is the primary content of most websites, and also the easiest value to edit visually. You can use the Source or Text *Editable Regions* to edit text values. Which one you should use will depend on where the text is stored.

### Hard-coded text values in HTML-like files

Standalone pages on your website, like a "Home" or "About" page, are probably generated from a single file with HTML-like content and templating. These pages are often landing pages, so an accurate visual editing experience is important to help your team understand exactly what a website visitor will see.

The term "HTML-like" refers to any file that incorporates HTML structure and templating. Based on the SSG your *Site* uses, the format and extension of these files may differ (e.g., Astro uses `.astro` files, Eleventy uses `.liquid` files), but as long as they output to an HTML file after a Site build, you can still add *Editable Regions*.

Let's take a look at an example.

Here is an excerpt from the "Home" page of our website. It is mainly comprised of text inside `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<ul>` tags, as well as an `<img>` tag.

<comp.CodeBlock language="Astro" source="index.astro">
``````````

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <body>
    <main>
      <img src="/cloudcannon-logo.jpg">
      <h1>Hello!</h1>
      <p>
          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut
          labore et dolore magna aliqua. Vitae ultricies leo integer malesuada nunc vel risus commodo
          viverra. Adipiscing enim eu turpis egestas pretium.
      </p>
      <p>Varius sit amet mattis vulputate enim. Habitasse platea dictumst:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Morbi tristique senectus et netus.</li>
          <li>Id semper risus in hendrerit gravida rutrum quisque non tellus.</li>
          <li>Habitasse platea dictumst quisque sagittis purus sit amet.</li>
          <li>Tellus molestie nunc non blandit massa.</li>
          <li>Cursus vitae congue mauris rhoncus.</li>
      </ul>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>

``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

This file outputs a webpage that looks like this:

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/guides/configure-visual-editing/2025-11/CloudCannon-Documentation-Visual-Editing-Guide-Home-Page.png" alt="A screenshot of the home page on our Astro website shows a header image, title, and content." title="The home page" type="screenshot"/>

In this example, we want to visually edit the title of our Home page in the Visual Editor. We can add a Source *Editable Region* to our Home page.

The text value of our page title is "Hello!" which is hard-coded in an `<h1>` tag. To define a Source *Editable Region*, we can add the `data-editable`, `data-path`, and `data-key` HTML attributes to the `<h1>` DOM element. The `data-editable` HTML attribute defines which type of *Editable Region* you want to use.

The `data-path` HTML attribute defines where your data is stored which, in this case, in the the path of the file: `/src/pages/index.astro`. The `data-key` HTML attribute acts as a unique identifier for an *Editable Region*, so CloudCannon knows which value to update if you have several *Editable Regions* in one file. We recommend choosing a key that provides context for which area of your code an editable region affects. In this example, we'll use the value `title`.

Here's what our Home page code should look like:

<comp.CodeBlock language="Astro" source="index.astro">
``````````

<h1 data-editable="source" data-path="/src/pages/index.astro" data-key="title">Hello!</h1> /*1*/

``````````
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  The `data-editable` attribute defines what kind of data this element contains, the `data-path` attribute defines the path to the file we want to edit, and the `data-key` attribute defines the unique identifier for this region if there are multiple regions in the file. In this case, we want a Source *Editable Region*, so the value of `data-editable` is `source`, we want to edit the `/src/pages/index.astro` file, and the unique key is `title`.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>

Once we save and rebuild our *Site*, CloudCannon will show a yellow *Editable Region* box around the `<h1>` tag content in the Visual Editor. When you click into the *Editable Region*, you can type inline to change the value of the `<h1>` tag.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Visual-Editor-Source-Editable-Region" alt="A screenshot of the Visual Editor shows yellow Editable Region boxes around the rich text content on the Home webpage." title="Source Editable Region in the Visual Editor" type="screenshot"/>

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  <p>Do not nest Text or Image <em>Editable Regions</em> inside Source <em>Editable Regions</em>.</p>
</comp.Notice>

### Text values in structured data

Many of the files on your website are likely to be content files, containing structured data keys (e.g., `title`, `publish_date`, `author`) in the front matter which populate templating in a layout file at build time.

Let's take a look at an example.

This file is a blog post, containing structured data keys for `title`, `author`, `heroImage`, `heroImageTitle`, and `heroImageAlt` in the front matter, and Markdown content in the body of the file.

<comp.CodeBlock language="markdown" source="first-post.mdx">
``````````

---
title: 'First post'
author: 'C. Kent'
heroImage: '../../assets/blog-banner.jpg'
heroImageTitle: 'Blog gradient'
heroImageAlt: 'An eye-catching color gradient banner.'
---

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Vitae ultricies leo integer malesuada nunc vel risus commodo viverra.

``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

Here is an excerpt from our blog layout file, containing HTML for the blog webpage and templating to populate elements with the values from each blog file.

<comp.CodeBlock language="Astro" source="BlogPost.astro">
``````````

---
const { title, author, heroImage, heroImageTitle, heroImageAlt } = Astro.props;
---
<article>
    <div class="hero-image">
        {heroImage &&
            <img
              src={heroImage}
              title={heroImageTitle}
              alt={heroImageAlt}
            />
          }
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
        <div class="title">
            <h1>{title}</h1> /*1*/
            <p>By: {author}</p> /*2*/
            <hr />
        </div>
        <slot />
    </div>
</article>

``````````
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  This `<h1>` element surrounds the template value `{title}`. This value comes from the `title` key in the front matter of a blog file.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="2">
  This `<p>` element surrounds the template value `{author}`, prepended by the plain text "By:". This value comes from the `author` key in the front matter of a blog file.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p>The file type for your layouts will be different depending on your SSG (e.g., Astro uses <code>.astro</code> files, Eleventy uses <code>.liquid</code> files). You can add <em>Editable Regions</em> to any of these files as long as they output to an HTML file after a <em>Site</em> build.</p>
</comp.Notice>

Together, these files output a webpage that looks like this:

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/guides/configure-visual-editing/2025-11/CloudCannon-Documentation-Visual-Editing-Guide-Content-Page.png" alt="A screenshot of a blog page on our Astro website shows a header image, title, author, and content." title="A blog page" type="screenshot"/>

In this example, each blog file contains two text front matter keys we want to visually edit: `title` and `author`. We can add Text *Editable Regions* to the blog layout file to enable visual editing for these text values in the entire *Collection*.

Let's start with `title`.

The `title` key in the front matter of each blog file populates the `{title}` templating field in our blog layout, which is inside an `<h1>` tag. To define a Text *Editable Region*, we can add the `data-editable` and `data-prop` HTML attributes to the `<h1>` DOM element. In this case, the value of `data-editable` should be `text`, as we want to edit a text value stored outside of the blog layout. The `data-prop` HTML attribute defines where your data is stored which, in this case, will be the `title` front matter key.

Here's what our blog layout code should look like:

<comp.CodeBlock language="Astro" source="BlogPost.astro">
``````````

<h1 data-editable="text" data-prop="title">{title}</h1> /*1*/

``````````
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  The `data-editable` attribute defines what kind of data this element contains, and the `data-prop` attribute defines the path to the data we want to edit. In this case, we want a Text *Editable Region*, so the value of `data-editable` is `text`, and we want to edit the `title` structured data key in the file front matter.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>

Adding a Text *Editable Region* for `{author}` is slightly more complicated.

The `author` key in the front matter of each blog file populates the `{author}` templating field in our blog layout, which is inside an `<p>` tag. The `{author}` templating field is not the only content inside the `<p>` tag: the plain text "By:" prepends the author value. If we added `data-editable="text" data-prop="author"` to the `<p>` tag in our blog layout, the Visual Editor would re-render the field to only show the value of `author`, hiding the plain text.

It is important to note that Text *Editable Regions* don't modify the code in your layout file, so the "By:" plain text is not destroyed. Instead, they update the value of the front matter key and re-render the webpage preview in the Visual Editor. This leads to a mismatch in the appearance of the built *Site*, which includes "By:" before the author name, and the preview in the Visual Editor, which would not.

To avoid this issue, we can use the web component `<editable-text>` instead. The `<editable-text>` web component replaces the need for the `data-editable="text"` attribute, telling CloudCannon what type of data we are editing. This is useful if you want to edit an element that can't take attributes, or a specific section of a string.

We can add the `data-prop="author"` attribute to this web component.

Here's what our blog layout code should look like:

<comp.CodeBlock language="Astro" source="BlogPost.astro">
``````````

<p>By: <editable-text data-prop="author">{author}</editable-text></p> /*1*/

``````````
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  The `<editable-text>` web component defines what kind of data this element contains, and the `data-prop` attribute defines the path to the data we want to edit. In this case, we used the web component to wrap the `{author}` templating specifically, and we want to edit the `author` structured data key in the file front matter.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>

Once we save and rebuild our *Site*, CloudCannon will show yellow boxes around the title and author fields on the webpage, indicating *Editable Regions* in the Visual Editor. You can edit the text value of `title` and `author` inline on the page when you click into the *Editable Region*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Visual-Editor-Frontmatter-Text-Editable-Regions" alt="A screenshot of the Visual Editor shows yellow Editable Regions boxes around the title and author fields on the webpage." title="Text Editable Regions in the Visual Editor" type="screenshot"/>
