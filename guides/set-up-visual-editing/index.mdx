description: Learn how to set up visual editing for your website on CloudCannon.
---
Welcome to CloudCannon's Set up Visual Editing guide!

Visual editing on CloudCannon allows you to make changes directly on an interactive preview of your webpage. In the Visual Editor, you can navigate between your webpages just as you would on your live website, and click into text areas, images, or arrays to update your content. By setting up visual editing, you can provide an intuitive way to edit content for any file that outputs to an HTML page.

In this guide, we'll cover how to build your *Site* in CloudCannon and how to add *Editable Regions* to your files with HTML attributes, along with best practices and common errors.

This guide has an in-app counterpart, *Set up Visual Editing*, which you can find on the *Guides* tab of your *Site Dashboard*. We recommend you mark the in-app guide as active now, so you can follow configuration prompts in CloudCannon.

Before we begin, this guide assumes that you have completed the *Getting Started with Editing* guide, know the correct build settings for your *Site*, and are comfortable editing HTML layouts, either in CloudCannon's Source Editor or your local development environment.
