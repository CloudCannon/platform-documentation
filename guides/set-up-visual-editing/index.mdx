description: Learn how to set up WYSIWYG editing for your website on CloudCannon.
---
Welcome to CloudCannon's Getting Started with Editing guide!

This guide is an excellent starting point for developers new to CloudCannon. We recommend that you complete this guide first, as other guides on the CloudCannon Documentation website may rely on the steps outlined here.

CloudCannon is a Git-based Content Management System designed to help teams (or individuals) manage their website content and code. Developers can commit changes to a Git repository that syncs to CloudCannon. At the same time, non-technical team members can effortlessly update and manage your content without knowing anything about Git, Markdown, or HTML. All your files are stored safely and securely in your Git repository â€” no vendor lock-in.

In this guide, we'll cover how to create an account, add your files to a *Site*, and set yourself up for success on CloudCannon. By the end of this guide, you will have set up a basic *Site* in CloudCannon with WYSIWYG editing, ready for you to manage your content.

Before we begin, this guide assumes you already have a website and your files are uploaded to a Git repository. Although you can <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/create-a-site-with-direct-upload/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upload files directly</a> from your local storage, we highly recommend using a Git repository.

Welcome to the Configure Visual Editing guide!

Visual editing on CloudCannon allows you to update your files using an interactive preview of your Site. You can navigate your pages as you would on your live Site and edit directly on the page. You can use CloudCannon's Visual Editor for any file that outputs to an HTML page on your site.

By configuring visual editing, you can provide your team members with the most intuitive way to edit content in CloudCannon.

In this guide, we'll cover the different types of CloudCannon Editables, including how to:

* Add visual editing for front matter in content files with Text and Image Editables.
* Add visual editing for HTML-like files with Source Editables.
* Allow users to click and drag elements around the Visual Editor using Array Editables.
* ...

This guide matches the *Configure visual editing* task on the *Getting Started* task list. You can mark this quest as completed after adding any of the configuration options outlined in this guide and saving the configuration to your `cloudcannon.config.yml` file.

Before we begin, this guide assumes you have enabled building for your Site on CloudCannon and have at least one successful build, as CloudCannon generates preview webpages of each output file during your last Site build. Additionally, you should be comfortable with editing HTML layouts, either in CloudCannon's Source Editor or your local development environment.
