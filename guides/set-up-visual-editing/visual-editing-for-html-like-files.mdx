  Learn how to configure Editable Regions for your 
  HTML-like files, such as a Home or About page.
---
For most static websites, webpages generated by a *Collection* of content files and a layout only represent a portion of your website. Other pages, like a "Home" or "About" page, are standalone pages generated from a single file with HTML-like content.

Because these pages are often landing pages on your website, an accurate visual editing experience is important, as it will help your team understand exactly what a website visitor will see.

Let's complete the next task in the *Set up Visual Editing* in-app guide: *Make your stand-alone webpages visually editable*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Source-Editable-Regions-Task" alt="A screenshot of the Make your stand-alone webpages visually editable task from the Set up Visual Editing in-app guide." title="The source visual editing task" type="screenshot"/>

In this step of the guide, we'll cover how to add *Editable Regions* for source code in your HTML-like files. If you don't have any appropriate files or don't want to add this type of *Editable Region*, you can skip this step of the guide.

## What is an HTML-like file?

The term "HTML-like" refers to any file that incorporates HTML structure and templating. Based on the SSG your *Site* uses, the format and extension of these files may differ (e.g., Astro uses `.astro` files, Eleventy uses `.liquid` files), but as long as they output to an HTML file after a Site build, you can still add *Editable Regions*.

Let's take a look at an example.

Here is an excerpt from the "Home" page of our website. It is mainly comprised of text inside `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<ul>` tags, as well as an `<img>` tag.

<comp.CodeBlock language="Astro" source="index.astro">
``````````

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <body>
    <main> /*1*/
      <img src="/cloudcannon-logo.jpg">
      <h1>Hello!</h1>
      <p>
          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut
          labore et dolore magna aliqua. Vitae ultricies leo integer malesuada nunc vel risus commodo
          viverra. Adipiscing enim eu turpis egestas pretium.
      </p>

          platea dictumst vestibulum. Sagittis purus sit amet volutpat. Netus
          et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Eget magna fermentum iaculis eu non diam phasellus

    </main>
  </body>
</html>

This file outputs a webpage that looks like this:

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/guides/configure-visual-editing/2025-11/CloudCannon-Documentation-Visual-Editing-Guide-Home-Page.png" alt="A screenshot of the home page on our Astro website shows a header image, title, and content." title="The home page" type="screenshot"/>

## Visually editing source code

In our example above, we want to edit everything inside of the `<main>` tag in the Visual Editor as rich text. We can do that by adding the `data-editable`, `data-path`, and `data-key` attributes.

Like in our previous step, [Visual editing for content files](/documentation/guides/set-up-visual-editing/visual-editing-for-content-files/), the `data-editable` HTML attribute will define the type of data we want to edit. In this case, the value is `source` as the `<main>` tag contains source code. We can add this to the `<main>` tag, or nest the equivalent web component `<editable-source>` inside the `<main>` tag.

The Source *Editable Region* also requires you to define the `data-path` and `data-key` attributes.

The `data-path` attribute is similar to `data-prop`; it defines the location that data is stored. However, unlike the changes we made to the blog layout file in the [previous step of this guide](/documentation/guides/configure-visual-editing/editing-content-files/), our Home page stores text directly within the HTML elements, not in a structured front matter key. We want CloudCannon to update the value of this file every time we edit it in the Visual Editor, so let's make the value the path of the file: `/src/pages/index.astro`.

The `data-key` attribute acts as a unique identifier for an editable region. This means if you have several editable regions in one file, CloudCannon knows which value to update. We recommend choosing a key that provides context for which area of your code an editable region affects. In this example, we'll use the value `main`.

Here's what our Home page code should look like:

<comp.CodeBlock language="Astro" source="index.astro">
``````````

<main data-editable="source" data-path="/src/pages/index.astro" data-key="main"> /*1*/

``````````
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  The `data-editable` attribute defines what kind of data this element contains, the `data-path` attribute defines the path to the file we want to edit, and the `data-key` attribute defines the unique identifier for this region if there are multiple regions in the file. In this case, we want a Source *Editable Region*, so the value of `data-editable` is `source`, we want to edit the `/src/pages/index.astro` file, and the unique key is `main`.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>

Once we save and rebuild our *Site*, CloudCannon will show a yellow *Editable Regions* box all the content inside the `<main>` tag on the Home page in the Visual Editor, enabling rich text editing. When you click into the *Editable Region*, CloudCannon will also display a WYSIWYG toolbar for formatting your content.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Visual-Editor-Source-Editable-Region" alt="A screenshot of the Visual Editor shows yellow Editable Region boxes around the rich text content on the Home webpage." title="Source Editable Region in the Visual Editor" type="screenshot"/>

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  <p>Do not nest Text or Image <em>Editable Regions</em> inside Source <em>Editable Regions</em>.</p>
</comp.Notice>

## Types of editable text

Why did the Visual Editor show a WYSIWYG toolbar for the content of our blog files, but not for the title or author? CloudCannon shows you different editing options based on whether your *Editable Region* contains plain text or rich text.

You can manually define this behavior using the `data-type` attribute, which accepts three values: `span`, `text`, or `block`.

Setting `data-type` as `span` does not allow any rich text formatting (i.e., plain, inline text), while `text` allows paragraph-level rich text, with a WYSIWYG toolbar containing formatting tools such as bold, italics, and links. Setting `data-type` to `block` allows all rich text formatting options, from paragraph-level to block-level formatting like lists, block-quotes, images, snippets, and text styling.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p>If you want to specify exactly which formatting tools are available, you can manually define your WYSIWYG toolbar under the <code>_editables</code> key in your CloudCannon Configuration File. For more information, please read our documentation on <a href="/documentation/articles/configure-your-rich-text-editors/#editable-regions">Configuring your rich text editors</a>.</p>
</comp.Notice>

Allowing rich text formatting in an element that can only support plain text can be destructive to your content and HTML. When `data-type` is not defined, as in the above example, CloudCannon determines an appropriate default.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/guides/configure-visual-editing/2025-10/CloudCannon-Documentation-Editables-Data-Type-Flowchart.png" alt="An illustration of the flowchart CloudCannon uses to decide if rich text formatting is appropriate for an element." title="The Data Type Flowchart" type="ui-snippet"/>

To begin, CloudCannon determines whether the Editable is for content or front matter. Content is any Source *Editable Region* (i.e., `data-attribute="source"` or `<source-editable>`), or Text *Editable Region* where `data-prop="@content"`. Front matter is any Text Editable where `data-prop` is set to a structured data key.

If the *Editable Region* is for content, CloudCannon will use either `text` or `block` as the default value of `data-type`, as the content is likely to need rich text formatting. Whether paragraph-level rich text formatting or all rich text formatting options are available will depend on the HTML element in the output file(e.g., `<h1>` elements can only support `text` level formatting, while `<div>` elements can support `block` level formatting).

If the *Editable Region* is for a value stored in front matter, CloudCannon will determine whether you have input configuration for that front matter key. If you do not, CloudCannon will use `data-type="span"` by default. Similarly, if you do have input configuration, but the input type is not defined as rich text (i.e., `markdown` or `html`), CloudCannon will use `data-type="span"` by default.

If your front matter key is configured as a rich text input, CloudCannon will use either `text` or `block` as the default value of `data-type`, whichever is appropriate for the HTML element in the output file.

For a complete list of configuration options for *Editable Regions*, please read our [Visual Editing reference](/documentation/articles/editables-reference) documentation.

## Common errors

If you accidentally misconfigure your *Editable Regions*, CloudCannon will display a red warning box in the Visual Editor.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title="" type="screenshot"/>

Here are a few common errors you might encounter with Source *Editable Regions*:

* You did not define the `data-path` or `data-key` HTML attribute.
* The *Editable Region* has an invalid data type (e.g., your Text region has a number or object, instead of a string).
* The file path defined by `data-path` does not exist.
* You have an unsupported value for `data-type`. It must be `span`, `text`, or `block`.
* There are *Editable Regions* with the same `data-key` value. This value should be unique.

In the next step of this guide, we'll cover how to add Array *Editable Regions* to simple and complex arrays, allowing you to edit, remove, and reorder array items in the Visual Editor.
