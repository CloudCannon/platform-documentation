  Learn how to see which files were output to a live URL during your Site build
  and update the URL slug for your Collections.

The Visual Editor needs a preview of each webpage to facilitate visual editing. Webpage previews are generated at build time for each page that outputs to a live URL. During your *Site* build, CloudCannon automatically determined which files should be output to a live URL.

You can see your website live on your [Testing Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-testing-domain/). A link to your Testing Domain will appear in your *Site Header* after a successful build.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Header-Tools-Post-Build" alt="A screenshot of the Site Header shows a link to the Testing Domain, which appears after your first successful Site build." title="The Site Header" type="ui-snippet"/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p>If you have already configured a <a href="/documentation/articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/">Custom Domain</a>, such as by completing the <em>Host your Site on the</em> <em>Internet</em> guide, your <em>Site</em> build will also output your files to same slug on your Custom Domain.</p>
</comp.Notice>

It is important to review which files CloudCannon has output to a live URL. The next task in the *Set up Visual Editing* in-app guide asks you to confirm your output files.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Confirm-Output-Files-Task" alt="A screenshot of the Confirm your output files task shows two collections with eight output files." title="The Confirm output files task" type="ui-snippet"/>

If CloudCannon has successfully output all the files you expected to the correct live URLs, you can mark this task as complete. However, if you need to update the URL CloudCannon has output your files to, or add an output URL to a *Collection*, you can update your *Collection* configuration and rebuild your *Site*.

## What is an output URL?

An output URL is the URL CloudCannon outputs your files to during a *Site* build. Each output file will have a unique URL path, made of a subpath (optional) and a slug. The domain section of each URL will be the name of your [Testing Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-testing-domain/), or [Custom Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/) if you have one configured.

When you build your *Site*, CloudCannon will automatically determine the unique URL path for each output file.

Not all files on your website will have an output URL. For example, a blog *Collection* will have a unique output URL for each post, but a data file containing a list of blog tags will not.

CloudCannon will output most *Collections*,

&nbsp;

CloudCannon determines whether a *Collection* should have an output URL based on the file extension of files within that *Collection*.

By default, a "Pages" *Collection*

If a *Collection* does not have an output URL configured, CloudCannon cannot output webpages or generate a preview for the Visual Editor.

## Update your output URLs

You can specify the output URL for each *Collection* at any time, using a template string. A template string is made of plain text and placeholder values, allowing you to use structured data from your files in the

Click the *Configuration Mode switch* on the right of the *Site Header* to turn it on. Purple *Edit configuration* buttons will appear in several places across the CloudCannon UI, including the *Edit Advanced* in the top right of the *Collection Browser*.

Click on the *Edit Advanced* button to open the data panel.

You can use the *URL* text field to specify what live URL files in a *Collection* should output to using

By default, CloudCannon uses the full slug

* \[collection\]
* \[ext\]
* \[filename\]
* \[path\]
* \[base\_path\]
* \[relative\_path\]
* \[relative\_base\_path\]
* \[slug\]

* /blog/\[slug\]/
