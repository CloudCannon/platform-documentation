  Learn how to see which files were output to a live URL during your Site build
  and update the URL slug for your Collections.
---
The Visual Editor needs a preview of each webpage to facilitate visual editing. Webpage previews are generated at build time for each page that outputs to a live URL. During your *Site* build, CloudCannon automatically determined which files should be output to a live URL.

You can see your website live on your [Testing Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-testing-domain/). A link to your Testing Domain will appear in your *Site Header* after a successful build.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Header-Tools-Post-Build" alt="A screenshot of the Site Header shows a link to the Testing Domain, which appears after your first successful Site build." title="The Site Header" type="ui-snippet"/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p>If you have already configured a <a href="/documentation/articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/">Custom Domain</a>, such as by completing the <em>Host your Site on the</em> <em>Internet</em> guide, your <em>Site</em> build will also output your files to same slug on your Custom Domain.</p>
</comp.Notice>

It is important to review which files CloudCannon has output to a live URL. The next task in the *Set up Visual Editing* in-app guide asks you to confirm your output files.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Confirm-Output-Files-Task" alt="A screenshot of the Confirm your output files task shows two collections with eight output files." title="The Confirm output files task" type="ui-snippet"/>

If all your files were successfully output to the correct live URLs, you can mark this task as complete. However, if CloudCannon has not determined the correct output URLs automatically, you can update your *Collection* configuration.

## What is an output URL?

An output URL is the URL CloudCannon outputs your files to during a *Site* build. Each output file will have a unique URL path, made of a subpath (optional) and a slug. The domain section of each URL will be the name of your [Testing Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-testing-domain/), or [Custom Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/) if you have one configured.

When you build your *Site*, CloudCannon will automatically determine which unique URL path to look at for each output file. If a *Collection* does not have an output URL configured, CloudCannon cannot output webpages or generate a preview for the Visual Editor.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p>CloudCannon will look for output files from every <em>Collection</em> unless the <code>disable_url</code> key for that <em>Collection</em> is set to <code>true</code>.</p>
</comp.Notice>

## Update your output URLs

You can specify the output URL for each *Collection* at any time, using a template string. A template string is made of plain text and placeholder values, allowing you to use structured data from your files in the *Collection*.

Click the *Configuration Mode switch* on the right of the *Site Header* to turn it on. Purple *Edit configuration* buttons will appear in several places across the CloudCannon UI, including the *Edit Advanced* in the top right of the *Collection Browser*.

Click on the *Edit Advanced* button to open the data panel.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Configuration-Mode-Edit-Advanced-URL" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows the Edit Advanced data panel open with a text field for URL configuration." title="The Collection Browser with Edit Advanced panel" type="screenshot"/>

Find the *URL* text field in the *Edit Advanced* data panel. Here, you can specify what live URL files in a *Collection* should output to.

By default, CloudCannon uses `/collection/[slug]/`, with the name of the *Collection* as the subpath (unless it is the "Pages" *Collection*).

You can customise your template string using the following fixed placeholders:

* `[filename]` — Populated by the original filename including the file extension.
* `[slug]` — Populated by the original filename excluding the file extension. If the filename is "index", this will result in an empty string.
* `[relative_path]` — Populated by the original file name including the file extension, relative to the *Collection* path.
* `[relative_base_path]` — Populated by the original file name excluding the file extension, relative to the *Collection* path.
* `[full_slug]` — An alias for the template path `[relative_base_path]/[slug]`.
* `[path]` — Populated by the original file name including the file extension, relative to your *Site* source.
* `[base_path]` — Populated by the original file name excluding the file extension, relative to your *Site* source.
* `[collection]` — Populated by the key for the *Collection* to which the file belongs.
* `[ext]` — Populated by the last file extension in the original file path.

You can reference any front matter field from your file in your output URL template string by using the key name in curly brackets (e.g., `{key}`), and apply filters using the `|` character after your front matter key name and then the name of the filter.

For a complete list of filters are available for data placeholders in your output URL template string, please read our documentation on [template strings](/documentation/articles/configure-your-template-strings/).

Once you have updated the template string in the *URL* text field, save the changes to your *Configuration File*. CloudCannon will rebuild your *Site* using the new output URLs.

When you are happy with the output files from your website, you can mark the *Confirm your output file* task as complete.

In the next step of this guide, we'll learn about *Editable Regions*, including their types and best practices for implementing them.
