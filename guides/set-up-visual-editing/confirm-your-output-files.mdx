  Learn how to see which files were output to a live URL during your Site build
  and update the URL slug for your Collections.

The Visual Editor needs a preview of each webpage to facilitate visual editing. Webpage previews are generated at build time for each page that outputs to a live URL. During your *Site* build, CloudCannon automatically determined which files should be output to a live URL.

You can see your website live on your [Testing Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-testing-domain/). A link to your Testing Domain will appear in your *Site Header* after a successful build.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Header-Tools-Post-Build" alt="A screenshot of the Site Header shows a link to the Testing Domain, which appears after your first successful Site build." title="The Site Header" type="ui-snippet"/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p>If you have already configured a <a href="/documentation/articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/">Custom Domain</a>, such as by completing the <em>Host your Site on the</em> <em>Internet</em> guide, your <em>Site</em> build will also output your files to same slug on your Custom Domain.</p>
</comp.Notice>

It is important to review which files CloudCannon has output to a live URL. The next task in the *Set up Visual Editing* in-app guide asks you to confirm your output files.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Confirm-Output-Files-Task" alt="A screenshot of the Confirm your output files task shows two collections with eight output files." title="The Confirm output files task" type="ui-snippet"/>

If CloudCannon has successfully output all the files you expected to the correct live URLs, you can mark this task as complete. However, if you need to update the URL CloudCannon has output your files to, or add an output URL to a *Collection*, you can update your *Collection* configuration and rebuild your *Site*.

## Update your output URLs
