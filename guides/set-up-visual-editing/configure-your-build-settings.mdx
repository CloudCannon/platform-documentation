  Learn how to enable Site builds on CloudCannon and configure your build
  settings for visual editing.
---
A "build" is when CloudCannon converts all your Site files into a single, functional website.

You will eventually need to build your website to host it on the Internet, but you don't need to do it through CloudCannon. However, building through CloudCannon does enable specific features, such as the Visual Editor, preview screenshots for output files in your *Collection Browser*, and the Testing Domain and Custom Domain.

If you don't want these features or you use another software to build your website, you can disable builds to create a "headless" Site.

In this step of the guide, we'll cover the benefits and drawbacks of each option. When you are ready to select an option, click the *Configure your build* button or the *Go Headless* button under the *Build your build or go Headless* task on your *Getting started* task list.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Build-or-Headless-Task" alt="A screenshot of the Build your Site or go Headless task from the Getting Started task list shows two buttons for building or headless." title="The Choose build mode task" type="ui-snippet"/>

You can change this setting at any time on the *Build Configuration* page under *Site Settings*.

## Building on CloudCannon

Building on CloudCannon enables several helpful features, most of which rely on CloudCannon building your Site to generate a preview of your webpages. These webpage previews are used in the Visual Editor, the Testing Domain, and as screenshots for output files in your *Collection Browser*.

As we saw in the [Editing files and saving changes](/documentation/guides/getting-started-with-editing/editing-files-and-saving-changes/) step of this guide, the Visual Editor allows you to edit your content directly on a preview of your webpage. Editing in the Visual Editor allows you to see your content in context,

<comp.DocsVideo url="https://player.vimeo.com/progressive_redirect/playback/949770947/rendition/1080p/file.mp4?loc=external&signature=5b5c24abc0922a7e42e3aab8b728a7d25e67c546b59b5499453d19bf37cf71aa" title="Visual Editor with data bindings" autoplay={true} loop={true}/>

A Testing Domain is a free, de-indexed *.cloudvent.net* URL that CloudCannon assigns to every Site. Each Testing Domain uses a randomly generated adjective and noun separated by a hyphen (i.e., <a href="https://grey-grouse.cloudvent.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">grey-grouse.cloudvent.net</a> or <a href="https://brave-submarine.cloudvent.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">brave-submarine.cloudvent.net</a>). You can use your Testing Domain to see your content live on the Internet after each successful Site build.

Because each Site on CloudCannon can be a different branch of your Git repository, you can see your changes as they would appear live on your Testing Domain, and share that link with others to review your content. Once you build your Site, the Testing Domain will appear in your *Site Header*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Header-After-Build" alt="A screenshot of the Site Header shows the URL for a Testing Domain in the top right." title="The Site Header" type="ui-snippet"/>

Building your Site allows CloudCannon to use a preview of your webpages for each output file in your *Collection Browser*. These screenshots help you identify the webpage associated with each file, and make the *Collection Browser* easier to navigate.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows that each file Card displays a preview screenshot of the web page it outputs to." title="The Collection Browser" type="screenshot"/>

Finally, you must build your Site through CloudCannon if you want to use CloudCannon as your web hosting service. We'll cover this in greater detail in the [Configure web hosting](/documentation/guides/configure-web-hosting/) guide, but for now, it's important to know that you cannot host your Site on a Custom Domain through CloudCannon without building (you can, however, host your Site using a trusted third-party hosting service).

If you choose to enable building, CloudCannon will build your Site each time you save changes to your content, generating a new preview of your webpages.

### Configure your build

If you want to build your Site through CloudCannon, click the *Configure your build* button in the *Build your build or go Headless* task on your *Getting started* task list. CloudCannon will open the *Configure your build* modal.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Configure-Build-Modal" alt="A screenshot of the Configure your build modal." title="The Configure your build modal" type="screenshot"/>

To build your Site, CloudCannon needs to know a few details about how your website functions. CloudCannon can make suggestions based on the SSG your Site uses and the contents of your files. These suggestions appear under each text field in the *Configure your build* modal in a light blue box.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Build-Configuration-Install-Command-Suggestion" alt="A screenshot of the Install Command text field and CloudCannon's suggested value in a light blue box." title="The build suggestions box" type="ui-snippet"/>

You can enter your own build settings or accept a suggestion by clicking on it, and CloudCannon will populate the text field. If you are unsure about the answers to any of these questions, please contact your developer or reach out to our friendly [support team](/support/).

Under the *Command line options* section, enter your *Install Command*, *Build Command*, *Output Path*, and *Environment Variables*. These help CloudCannon...

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Build-Configuration-Command-Line-Options" alt="A screenshot of the Configure your build modal shows the command line options." title="The Configure your build modal" type="screenshot"/>

Under the *Build system options* section, enter your *Preserved Paths*, and choose whether you want to enable the *Preserve Output*, *Include .git folder*, and *Manually Configure URLs* settings.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Build-Configuration-Build-System-Options" alt="A screenshot of the Configure your build modal shows the build system options, including Preserved Paths." title="The Configure your build modal" type="screenshot"/>

Finally, under the *Library Versions* section, review the versions of *Hugo*, *Ruby*, *Node*, and *Deno*. If your website uses any of these libraries, please ensure the version number is correct.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Build-Configuration-Library-Versions" alt="A screenshot of the Configure your build modal shows the library versions for Hugo, Ruby, Node, and Deno." title="The Configure your build modal" type="screenshot"/>

When you are happy with your answers, click the *Update configuration and Build* button. CloudCannon will start your first Site build using the configuration you defined.

### Your first build

Your first Site build should start immediately.

Whenever CloudCannon is building your Site, the *Building...* notification will appear in the bottom right of your screen. Clicking on the *View output* button on this notification will open the *Build output* modal.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

The *Build output* modal displays the *Build log* for your current build. *Build logs* are useful for keeping track of your build progress and diagnosing any issues if your build fails.

You can access a list of all your past *Build logs* on the *Builds* tab of your *Site Dashboard*. CloudCannon added this tab to your *Dashboard* after you configured your first build.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

You can also see the progress of your most recent build on the *Summary* tab of your *Dashboard*, on the right side under *Build*. You can trigger a new build at any time using the *Rebuild* button on the *Site Dashboard* or cancel a running build using the *Cancel build* button.

If your build fails, there are a few common reasons why your build might fail. If you don't see any solutions in the list below, please reach out to our friendly [support team](/support/).

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  **Hugo**

  If you built your site using the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">Hugo Quick Start guide</a>, you will have installed the Ananke theme for Hugo as a git submodule. CloudCannon doesn't support submodules by default, but you can clone the submodule repository using CloudCannon's build hooks.

  To fix this build error, create a `.cloudcannon/preinstall` file in the root directory of your repository, with this line of code:

  <comp.CodeBlock language="bash" source=".cloudcannon/preinstall">
                                            ```
                                            git clone https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
                                            ```
                                            </comp.CodeBlock>
</comp.Notice>

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  **Next.js**

  Your build needs to output static files for CloudCannon to work correctly.

  If you are using Next.js v13.3.0 and above, you must add `output: 'export'` to your `next.config.js` file. Read the [Next.js documentation on Static Exports](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) for more information.

  For Next.js versions earlier than v13.3.0, you should add `next export` to your build command instead. For example, the build script in your `package.json` could be `next build && next export`.
</comp.Notice>

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  **Nuxt**

  Sometimes, your terminal will say that the build did not output any files. Ensure you use the `nuxt generate` command and that the output directory matches the output specified in your Nuxt configuration.
</comp.Notice>

## Headless Mode on CloudCannon

A "headless" website is one where the frontend and backend are separated. In Headless Mode, CloudCannon still manages your content but doesn't affect any frontend activities like building or hosting. By decoupling your website content from the presentation layer, you can manage the content independently from the output format.

Headless Mode might be right for you if:

* You already use another software to build your website.

Enabling Headless Mode will disable the building and hosting of your Site on CloudCannon.

If you want to put your Site in Headless Mode, click the *Go Headless* button in the *Build your build or go Headless* task on your *Getting started* task list. CloudCannon will open the *Go Headless* modal.

Confirm your choice by clicking the *Turn off hosting and builds* button.
