  Learn how to enable Site builds on CloudCannon and configure your build
  settings for visual editing.
---
In CloudCannon's Visual Editor, you can edit directly on each webpage using a preview of your website. CloudCannon generates these preview webpages at build time, allowing you to see the most up-to-date version of your website every time you use the Visual Editor.

Let's complete the first task in the *Set up Visual Editing* in-app guide: *Configure your Site's build settings*. If you have already configured your build settings, such as in the [Host your website on the Internet](/documentation/guides/host-your-website/) guide, you can skip this step of the guide.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Configure-Build-Task" alt="A screenshot of the Site Dashboard shows the Set up Visual Editing in-app guide with the first task, Configure your Site's build settings." title="The Site Dashboard" type="ui-snippet"/>

## What is a build?

A "build" is when CloudCannon converts all your *Site* files into a single, functional website. Building on CloudCannon is optional, but is required for specific features, such as the Visual Editor, preview screenshots for output files in your *Collection Browser*, and the Testing Domain and Custom Domain.

CloudCannon uses a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) system. Every time you trigger a build of your Site, CloudCannon will:

1. Download your files onto our server.
2. Run your selected install commands (e.g., `npm install`, `bundle install`).
3. Run your selected build commands (e.g., `npm run build`).
4. Index your output files.
5. Upload your output files to CloudCannon to generate previews in the Visual Editor, Testing Domain, and *Collection Browser* screenshots, and deliver them to your live Custom Domain (if you are hosting with CloudCannon).

To configure your build, you need to provide CloudCannon with your commands and the path to your output folder.

## Configure your build

Click the *Configure your build* button in your in-app guide under the *Configure your Site's build settings* task. CloudCannon will open the *Configure your build* modal.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Configure-Build-Modal" alt="A screenshot of the Configure your build modal." title="The Configure your build modal" type="screenshot"/>

To build your *Site*, CloudCannon needs to know a few details about how your website functions, such as your *Command line options*, *Build system options*, and *Library Versions* (if applicable).

CloudCannon can make suggestions for your build settings based on the SSG your *Site* uses and the contents of your files. You can enter your own build settings or accept a suggestion by clicking the *Use* button, and CloudCannon will populate the text field. If you are unsure about the correct build settings for your *Site*, please contact your developer or reach out to our friendly [support team](/support/).

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Build-Configuration-Install-Command-Suggestion" alt="A screenshot of the Install Command text field and CloudCannon's suggested value in a light blue box." title="The build suggestions box" type="ui-snippet"/>

Under the *Command line options* section, enter your *Install Command*, *Build Command*, *Output Path*, and *Environment Variables*. CloudCannon requires a value for *Output Path*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Build-Configuration-Command-Line-Options" alt="A screenshot of the Configure your build modal shows the command line options." title="The Configure your build modal" type="screenshot"/>

Under the *Build system options* section, enter your *Preserved Paths*, and choose whether you want to enable the *Preserve Output*, *Include .git folder*, and *Manually Configure URLs* settings.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Build-Configuration-Build-System-Options" alt="A screenshot of the Configure your build modal shows the build system options, including Preserved Paths." title="The Configure your build modal" type="screenshot"/>

Finally, under the *Library Versions* section, review the versions of *Hugo*, *Ruby*, *Node*, and *Deno*. If your website uses any of these libraries, please ensure the version number is correct.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Build-Configuration-Library-Versions" alt="A screenshot of the Configure your build modal shows the library versions for Hugo, Ruby, Node, and Deno." title="The Configure your build modal" type="screenshot"/>

When you are happy with your answers, click the *Update Configuration and Build* button. CloudCannon will start your first *Site* build using the configuration you defined.

### Your first build

Your first *Site* build should start immediately.

Whenever CloudCannon is building your *Site*, the *Building...* notification will appear in the bottom right of your screen. Clicking on the *View output* button on this notification will open the *Build output* modal.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/builds/what-is-a-build/2024-08/CloudCannon-Documentation-Building-Toast-Notification.png" alt="A screenshot of the Content Editor with the Building notification in the bottom right shows a button labeled View Output." title="The Building notification" type="screenshot"/>

The *Build output* modal displays the *Build log* for your current build. *Build logs* are useful for keeping track of your build progress and diagnosing any issues if your build fails.

You can access a list of all your past *Build logs* on the *Builds* tab of your *Site Dashboard*. CloudCannon added this tab to your *Dashboard* after you configured your first build.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Builds-Tab" alt="A screenshot of the Builds tab on the Site Dashboard shows a list of all past build logs for this Site." title="The Site Dashboard Builds tab" type="screenshot"/>

You can also see the progress of your most recent build on the *Summary* tab of your *Dashboard*, on the right under *Build*. You can trigger a new build at any time using the *Rebuild* button on the *Site Dashboard* or cancel a running build using the *Cancel build* button.

If your build fails, there are a few common reasons why your build might fail. If you don't see any solutions in the list below, please reach out to our friendly [support team](/support/).

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  <p><strong>Hugo</strong></p>
  <p>If you built your <em>Site</em> using the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">Hugo Quick Start guide</a>, you will have installed the Ananke theme for Hugo as a git submodule. CloudCannon doesn't support submodules by default, but you can clone the submodule repository using CloudCannon's build hooks.</p>
  <p>To fix this build error, create a <code>.cloudcannon/preinstall</code> file in the root directory of your repository, with this line of code:</p>
  <p>
  <comp.CodeBlock language="bash" source=".cloudcannon/preinstall">
          ```
          git clone https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
          ```
          </comp.CodeBlock>
  </p>
</comp.Notice>

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  **Next.js**

  Your build needs to output static files for CloudCannon to work correctly.

  If you are using Next.js v13.3.0 and above, you must add `output: 'export'` to your `next.config.js` file. Read the [Next.js documentation on Static Exports](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) for more information.

  For Next.js versions earlier than v13.3.0, you should add `next export` to your build command instead. For example, the build script in your `package.json` could be `next build && next export`.
</comp.Notice>

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  **Nuxt**

  Sometimes, your terminal will say that the build did not output any files. Ensure you use the `nuxt generate` command and that the output directory matches the output specified in your Nuxt configuration.
</comp.Notice>

In the next step of this guide, we'll learn about the Visual Editor and the HTML attributes or web components you can add to your layout files to create *Editable Regions* in CloudCannon.
