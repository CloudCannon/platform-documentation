  Learn how to configure CloudCannon Editables for your 
  HTML-like files, such as a Home or About page.
---
For most static websites, webpages generated by a collection of content files and a layout only represent a portion of your website. Other pages, like a "Home" or "About" page, might come from a single file with HTML-like content (the exact format of your pages will differ depending on which SSG you use).

Here's an example of a Home page for a blog website.

<comp.CodeBlock language="Astro" source="index.astro">
``````````

import BaseHead from '../components/BaseHead.astro';
import Footer from '../components/Footer.astro';
import Header from '../components/Header.astro';
import { SITE_DESCRIPTION, SITE_TITLE } from '../consts';

<comp.Annotation number="1">
  This `<main>` element contains nested HTML elements.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>

When you first open a file like `index.astro` in the Visual Editor, there is nothing for you to interact with (with no structured data keys in front matter, CloudCannon can't even provide any Inputs in the sidebar).

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

Let's fix that by adding CloudCannon Editables to this file.

In this step of the guide, we'll add the following attributes:

* `data-editable="source"` and `<source-editable>` ‚Äî This attribute, and its equivalent web component, defines the data type inside an Editable as `source`.
* `data-path=""` ‚Äî This attribute defines the path to the data property you want to edit and passes that value to the CloudCannon Editable.
* `data-key=""` ‚Äî This attribute defines a unique identifier for an editable region within the file, which CloudCannon requires even if you don't have several discreet editable regions.

For a complete list of configuration options for CloudCannon Editables, please read our [Editables reference](/documentation/articles/editables-reference) documentation.

## Editing HTML **or template source code**

The Home page is mostly comprised of text inside `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<ul>` tags, and and `<img>`. Let's enable editing in the Visual Editor by adding the attributes `data-editable`, `data-path`, and `data-key` to the `<main>` tag.

To define what type of data we are editing, we need to add the `data-editable` attribute to the `<main>` tag. This time the value should be `source`, as the `<main>` tag contains nested HTML. We could also wrap the `<main>` element in the equivalent web component `<source-editables>`, however that is not as efficient as adding attributes to existing elements.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p>When using <code>data-editable="source"</code>, CloudCannon also requires you to define the <code>data-path</code> and <code>data-key</code> attributes.</p>
</comp.Notice>

The `data-path` attribute is similar to `data-prop`; it defines the location that data is stored. However, unlike the changes we made to the blog layout file in the [previous step of this guide](/documentation/guides/configure-visual-editing/editing-content-files/), our Home page stores text directly within the HTML elements, not in a structured data key. We want CloudCannon to update the value of this file every time we edit it in the Visual Editor, so let's make the value the path of the file: `/src/pages/index.astro`.

The `data-key` attribute acts as a unique identifier for an editable region. This means if you have several editable regions in one file, CloudCannon knows which value to update. We recommend choosing a key that provides context for which area of your code an editable region affects. In this example, we'll use the value `main`.

Here's what our Home page code should look like:

<comp.CodeBlock language="Astro" source="index.astro">
``````````

<main data-editable="source" data-path="/src/pages/index.astro" data-key="main"> /*1*/

``````````
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  This `<img>` element contains image width, height, source, and alt text attributes. The `src` attribute is set to the template `{heroImage}`, which draws its value from the `heroImage` key in the front matter of a blog file.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>

If we save and rebuild our Site, a yellow box showing an editable region will appear around the content on the Home page in the Visual Editor, enabling inline editing.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

## Plain text vs rich text

You might notice that a WYSIWYG toolbar appears above your content when you click into the editable region. WYSIWYG toolbars contain tools to support rich text formatting. This behavior is defined by the `data-type` attribute.

* `data-type` ‚Äî This attribute defines the element type and editing behavior.

The `data-type` attribute can take three values: `span`, `text`, and `block`.

Setting `data-type="span"` does not allow any rich text formatting, while `data-type="text"` allows paragraph-level rich text formatting such as bold, italics, and links. Setting `data-type="block"` allows all rich text formatting options, from paragraph-level to block-level formatting like lists, block-quotes, images, snippets, and text styling.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p>If you want to specify exactly which formatting tools are available, you can manually define your WYSIWYG toolbar under the <code>_editables</code> key in your CloudCannon Configuration File. For more information, please read our documentation on <a href="/documentation/articles/configure-your-rich-text-editors/#editable-regions">Configuring your rich text editors</a>.</p>
</comp.Notice>

Allowing rich text formatting in an element that can only support plain text can be destructive to your content and HTML. If the `data-type` attribute is not defined, as in the above example, CloudCannon has a few way of automatically determining whether content is plain text or rich text.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/guides/configure-visual-editing/2025-10/CloudCannon-Documentation-Editables-Data-Type-Flowchart.png" alt="An illustration of the flowchart CloudCannon uses to decide if rich text formatting is appropriate for an element." title="The Data Type Flowchart" type="ui-snippet"/>

To begin, CloudCannon determines whether the Editable is for content or front matter. Content is any Source Editable (i.e., `data-attribute="source"` or `<source-editable>`), or Text Editable where `data-prop="@content"`. Front matter is any Text Editable where `data-prop` is set to a structured data key.

If the Editable is for content, CloudCannon will use either `text` or `block` as the default value of `data-type`, as the content is likely to need rich text formatting. Whether paragraph-level rich text formatting or all rich text formatting options are available will depend on the HTML element in the output file(e.g., `<h1>` elements can only support `text` level formatting, while `<div>` elements can support `block` level formatting).

If the Editable is for a value stored in front matter, CloudCannon will determine whether you have input configuration for that front matter key. If you do not, CloudCannon will use `data-type="span"` by default. Similarly, if you do have input configuration, but the input type is not defined as rich text (i.e., `markdown` or `html`), CloudCannon will use `data-type="span"` by default.

If your front matter key is configured as a rich text input, CloudCannon will use either `text` or `block` as the default value of `data-type`, whichever is appropriate for the HTML element in the output file.

In the next step of this guide, we'll cover Array Editables, including how to use them for page building in the Visual Editor.
