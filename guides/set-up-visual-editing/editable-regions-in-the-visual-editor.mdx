## What are CloudCannon Editables?

CloudCannon Editables are attributes you can add to any DOM element on your website, including files that contain HTML templating, structured data, or markup content. After your next successful build, CloudCannon will re-render elements with Editable attributes in the Visual Editor as needed. Editables are available for all SSGs that CloudCannon supports.

With Editables configured, you can click directly on a preview of your webpage and edit inline content.

CloudCannon Editables also support page building. You can add new components to a page, remove old ones, and reorganize your components live on a preview of your webpage, at any time.
