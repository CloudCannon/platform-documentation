  Learn how to see which files were output to a live URL during your Site build
  and update the URL slug for your Collections.
---
When you [build](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-site-build/) your *Site*, CloudCannon will run the build command appropriate for your Static Site Generator (SSG). Your SSG will build your source files into your output files. These output files are what your website visitors will see on the Internet and what CloudCannon uses as the interactive webpage in the *Visual Editor*.

## How does CloudCannon use your output files?

When you click on a source file in the *Collection Browser* to open it in the *Visual Editor*, CloudCannon opens the appropriate output file. To open the correct output file in the *Visual Editor*, CloudCannon matches output files with source files using the output URL.

However, most modern websites do not have a one-to-one relationship between source files and output files. For example, the output file for your "Home" page will be `index.html`, but the content for this file could be stored across multiple source files (e.g., one for navigation, another for the footer, and a third for page content).

Whenever you finish a successful build, CloudCannon will automatically determine the likely output URL for each source file. The next task in the *Set up Visual Editing* in-app guide asks you to *Confirm your output URLs*, ensuring that CloudCannon is opening the correct output file for each source file in your *Collection Browser*.

Try opening some of your output files in the Visual Editor. If all your files open correctly, you can mark this task as complete. If a file will not open in the Visual Editor or opens to an incorrect webpage preview, it is most likely because CloudCannon has not determined the correct output URL. You can <a href="https://cloudcannon.com//documentation/guides/set-up-visual-editing/confirm-your-output-urls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update the output URL</a> for a *Collection* to fix this issue.

## Update the output URL for a webpage preview

To help CloudCannon match webpage previews to your output files, you can specify the output URL for each *Collection* using a template string. A template string is made of plain text and placeholder values, allowing you to use structured data from your files in the *Collection*.

Navigate to one of the *Collections* that does not correctly open in the Visual Editor and click the *Configuration Mode switch* on the right of the *Site Header* to turn it on. Purple *Edit configuration* buttons will appear in several places across the CloudCannon UI, including the *Edit Advanced* in the top right of the *Collection Browser*.

Click on the *Edit Advanced* button to open the data panel.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Configuration-Mode-Edit-Advanced-URL" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows the Edit Advanced data panel open with a text field for URL configuration." title="The Collection Browser with Edit Advanced panel" type="screenshot"/>

Find the *URL* text field in the *Edit Advanced* data panel. Here, you can specify which output URL CloudCannon should use to match webpage previews to the *Collection* using a template string.

Template strings allow you to use plain text, fixed or data placeholders, and filters to modify the value of data placeholders to create the correct URL format.

### Fixed placeholders

The following fixed placeholders are available for your output URL template string:

* `[filename]` — Populated by the original filename including the file extension.
* `[slug]` — Populated by the original filename excluding the file extension. If the filename is "index", this will result in an empty string.
* `[relative_path]` — Populated by the original file name including the file extension, relative to the *Collection* path.
* `[relative_base_path]` — Populated by the original file name excluding the file extension, relative to the *Collection* path.
* `[full_slug]` — An alias for the template path `[relative_base_path]/[slug]`.
* `[path]` — Populated by the original file name including the file extension, relative to your *Site* source.
* `[base_path]` — Populated by the original file name excluding the file extension, relative to your *Site* source.
* `[collection]` — Populated by the key for the *Collection* to which the file belongs.
* `[ext]` — Populated by the last file extension in the original file path.

Let's go through an example.

The `url` template string `/[relative_bath_path]/[slug]/` for our "Pages" *Collection* will resolve to the following output URLs:

* The file `/pages/index.md` becomes the output URL `/` (e.g., a Home landing page).
* The file `/pages/about.md` becomes the output URL `/about`.
* The file `/pages/contact/index.md` becomes the output URL `/contact/`.
* The file `/pages/contact/book-an-appointment.md` becomes the output URL `/contact/book-an-appointment`

### Data placeholders

You can reference any front matter field from your file in your output URL template string by using the key name in curly brackets (e.g., `{key}`).

You can also apply filters to your data placeholders by using the `|` character after your front matter key name, followed by the name of the filter.

Let's go through an example.

The `url` template string `/news/{date|year}/{date|month}-{date|day}_{title|slugify}/` for our "News" *Collection* will resolve to the following output URLs:

* The file `/news/our-next-feature.md` with the front matter fields `title: Our next feature!` and `date:05/11/2026` becomes the output URL `/2026/05-11_our-next-feature`.

For a complete list of filters available for data placeholders in your output URL template string, please read our documentation on [template strings](/documentation/articles/configure-your-template-strings/).

Once you have updated the template string in the *URL* text field, save the changes to your *Configuration File*. CloudCannon will automatically update which webpage previews it uses for that *Collection*.

When you are happy that all your output files open in the Visual Editor successfully, you can mark the *Confirm your output files* task as complete.

In the next step of this guide, we'll learn about *Editable Regions*, including their types and best practices for implementing them.
