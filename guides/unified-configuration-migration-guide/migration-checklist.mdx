## Migration preparation

We recommend creating a new branch of your Site for this migration to avoid any misconfiguration affecting your live Site.

To enable Unified Configuration:

1. Navigate to the *Flags* page under *Site Settings*.
2. Check the *Use unified configuration* flag under *General*.
3. Click the *Update* button.

CloudCannon now expects your Site to use the Unified Configuration file format.

<comp.DocsImage path="" alt="" title=""/>

In the short term, depending on how closely your Site configuration matches the Unified Configuration format, your Site may become misconfigured in CloudCannon. This could look like your collections displaying incorrectly or data sets in Select and Multiselect inputs working incorrectly. You will resolve this temporary state once you complete this migration guide.

One source of misconfiguration is opening your CloudCannon configuration file in the configuration GUI. As CloudCannon expects your configuration file to be in the Unified Configuration format, opening the file in the configuration GUI will strip content from your file (e.g., defunct keys). We highly recommend completing your migration in CloudCannon's Source Editor or your local development environment without using the configuration GUI.

## Checklist

### CloudCannon configuration file type

Your CloudCannon configuration file must be a YAML (recommended) or JSON file, rather than Javascript.

### Explicitly configure a path for every collection

Prior to Unified Configuration, CloudCannon would infer the path for each collection during your Site build step (e.g., Jekyll Sites automatically assume your posts collect are in the `_posts` folder). CloudCannon no longer uses this behavior.

Please ensure that each collection defined in `collections_config` has the `path` key defined. The below codeblock shows how to explicitly configure a path:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````

collections_config:
  blog:
    path: content/blog

``````````
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

### s

<comp.Conditional ssgs={["Hugo"]}>
  s
</comp.Conditional>

<comp.Conditional not_ssgs={["Hugo"]}>
  This step of the migration guide is only relevant to Sites using Hugo as their SSG.
</comp.Conditional>

### Update the format of your data sets

<comp.Conditional ssgs={["Hugo", "Eleventy", "Jekyll"]}>
  CloudCannon no longer exclusively reads data sets at build time. You must update your data configuration to

  The following data configurations are no longer used:

  <comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
  ``````````

  data_config: true

  ``````````
  </comp.MultiCodeBlock>

  <comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
  ``````````

  data_config:
    locations: true

  ``````````
  </comp.MultiCodeBlock>

  <comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
  ``````````

  data_config:
    locations:
      path: data/locations.yml
      parser: yaml # optional ___1___

  ``````````
  <comp.Annotation number="1">
  The key `data_config.*.parser` is now defunct.
</comp.Annotation> </comp.MultiCodeBlock>

  Please update `data_config` to:

  <comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
  ``````````

  data_config:
    locations:
      path: data/locations.yml

  ``````````
  </comp.MultiCodeBlock>

  &nbsp;
</comp.Conditional>

<comp.Conditional not_ssgs={["Hugo", "Eleventy", "Jekyll"]}>
  This step of the migration guide is only relevant to Sites using Eleventy, Hugo, or Jekyll as their SSG.
</comp.Conditional>

### Defunct configuration options

CloudCannon no longer uses some configuration options in the Unified Configuration file format. Although leaving these keys in your Site files will not harm your Site, they also will not function.

We recommend updating the following keys to their new counterparts:

x

We recommend deleting the following keys:

x

1. `data_config.*.parser`
2. &nbsp;`collections_config.*.parser`
3. `collections_config_override`
4. `collections_config.*.singular_key`
   1. Use configured `_inputs.*.options.values` rather than relying on the naming conventions.
5. `paths.data`
6. `paths.collections`
7. `paths.layouts`
8. `paths.includes`

### Replace collection filters with collection globs

x

### s

x

### Explicitly configure attributes for Editable Regions

x

## Migration conclusion

Once you have completed the migration checklist, open your Site in CloudCannon and review your configuration. Once you are happy with your changes, you can merge your branch with your main Site branch.
