<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  This Guide is relevant for CloudCannon Sites created before September 2024. Sites created after this date do not need to migrate.
</comp.Notice>

Welcome to the Unified Configuration migration guide! If you want to enable live configuration and data editing or update your existing Site to the Unified Configuration file format, you are in the right place!

Before we start, this guide assumes that you have an existing Site on CloudCannon created before September 2024.

In this guide we'll cover:

* What is live configuration and data editing and how do you enable it for your existing Sites?
* What is Unified Configuration and why would you migrate your existing Site to this file format?
* How do you migrate your Site configuration to the Unified Configuration file format?

You may not need to complete every step in this guide but please carefully review each step to see if it is applicable to your Site's configuration.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  The features discussed in this guide are part of CloudCannon's [Live Configuration Beta](/documentation/articles/beta/). While the Beta is ongoing, you must have your account in the Beta Environment to access these features.
</comp.Notice>

## What is live configuration and data editing?

Before September 2024, CloudCannon relied on a successful build to show you any updates to your configuration and data files in the app UI. This meant you had to wait for a build to see updates to your collections in the *App Navigation*, inputs in your editing interfaces, the appearance of your files, and more.

The live configuration and data editing feature allows you to see your changes live when you update your CloudCannon configuration files and data files â€” without the need to build your Site.

This means you can:

* Populate inputs with new Collections files before saving the file.
* Update your Input, Structure, and Schema configuration, and see those changes the next time you open a file in an editing interface.
  * (Note: CloudCannon applies a Schema to a file when first opened during an editing session. You will not see live changes from an updated Schema if a file is already open with unsaved changes.)
* See changes quickly when you reconfigure the appearance of your file cards.

Live configuration and data editing provide a better editing experience for your team.

Live configuration and data editing are automatically included for new Sites created with the Unified Configuration file format. For Sites created before September 2024, this feature may not be enabled. We'll cover how to enable this feature for existing Sites in step two of this guide.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Live configuration editing is unavailable for Sites using a JavaScript CLoudCannon configuration file. Please switch to a YAML (recommended) or JSON format to access this feature.
</comp.Notice>

## What is Unified Configuration?

The Unified Configuration file format simplifies Site setup. Sites created using a CloudCannon configuration file in the Unified Configuration file format require less information from you and use the same configuration options regardless of SSG. The Unified Configuration file format also enables you to manage your content in CloudCannon before your first build.

Unified Configuration also allows you to put your Site in Headless Mode, turning off builds and streamlining *Site Settings*. Headless Mode is ideal for Sites built and hosted externally or dynamic Sites that rely on server-side rendering.

These features mainly benefit new Sites (i.e., without a CloudCannon configuration file) and new CloudCannon customers. Additionally, you can benefit from live configuration and data editing on most existing Sites without migrating to the Unified Configuration file format. So why migrate your existing Sites?

If you have an existing Site on CloudCannon, migrating to Unified Configuration is optional, but there are some scenarios in which migration may benefit you.

### CloudCannon Documentation

The CloudCannon Documentation website prioritizes using the most up-to-date instructions and screenshots. If your Site does not use Unified Configuration...

**Migrating to Unified Configuration will make it easier to maintain your build configuration.**

### Future copies of your Site

The Unified Configuration file format improves your experience when creating new Sites (i.e., not branching from an existing Site). This benefit is not relevant to most existing Sites on CloudCannon, unless you plan to create a new copy of your Site at any point in the future.

Perhaps you want to create a new Site using the file structure of your existing Site, or you maintain website templates for use on CloudCannon. Migrating to Unified Configuration will improve the onboarding experience for your new Site.
