You can enable live configuration and data editing on your existing Sites without completing a full migration to Unified Configuration.

To enable live configuration and data editing:

1. Navigate to the *Flags* page under *Site Settings*.
2. Check the *Step 1: Enable live config and data reloading* flag under *Upgrade to Unified Configuration*.
3. Click the *Update* button.

CloudCannon will now load changes to your data and configuration files, including your Inputs, Structures, and Schemas, without the need to save and build your Site.

## Why is this feature behind a flag?

CloudCannon resolves live updates to your configuration and data editing on-demand and merges these updates with data from your latest successful build. For example, let's assume you edit a single input in your CloudCannon configuration file. Opening that data file in the Data Editor will show you inputs from various sources: one resolved by CloudCannon in the interface following your update and the rest from your last successful build.

For this reason, you may see issues in CloudCannon if:

* You modify your CloudCannon configuration file or the front matter of your content files during your build.
* Your SSG generates or modifies data during your build.

In these cases, applying your configuration and data changes on-demand may override the modified values from your last successful build. This behavior could impact:

* How CloudCannon displays file cards in your collection browser.
* How Select and Multiselect inputs connected to a collection or data set display labels and save values.
* Any configuration modified in a way that CloudCannon could not merge.

Although we do not expect this issue to affect many existing Sites, we have made this feature opt-in out of an abundance of caution.
