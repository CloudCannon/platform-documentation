## Migration conclusion

Once you have completed the migration checklist, open your Site in CloudCannon and review your configuration. Once you are happy with your changes, you can merge your branch with your main Site branch. On your main Site, check the *Use Unified Configuration* flag in your *Site Settings* and build your Site to remove any existing build integration output from previous builds. If you are planning to move your Site to Headless Mode, you can do this after your final build.

If you have any questions about this migration guide or need assistance, please contact our friendly [support team](/support/). We're always here to help.
