Once you have completed the migration checklist, open your Site in CloudCannon and review your configuration. Once you are happy with your changes, you can merge your branch with your main Site branch.

## Build configuration

<comp.Conditional ssgs={["Eleventy", "Hugo", "Jekyll"]}>
  CloudCannon uses a different build configuration for Site with the Unified Configuration file format. Checking the *Use Unified Configuration* flag in your *Site Settings* will also clear all your build commands. The final step in the migration is to reconfigure your build commands and build your Site to remove any existing build integration output from previous builds.

  <comp.Notice info_type="info">
    Even if you are planning to switch to [Headless Mode](/documentation/articles/what-is-headless-mode/), we recommend completing a final build before you switch.
  </comp.Notice>

  To configure your Site builds:

  1. Navigate to the *Build configuration* page under *Site Settings*.
  2. Under *Command line options*, enter your *Install Command*, *Build Command*, and *Output Path*. You can click on CloudCannon's suggested values to use them in your configuration.
  3. Click the *Update Configuration and Build* button.

  <comp.Notice info_type="info">
    CloudCannon will suggest command line options for you based on your SSG and the contents of your Site files.
  </comp.Notice>

</comp.Conditional>

<comp.Conditional not_ssgs={["Hugo", "Eleventy", "Jekyll"]}>
  This step of the migration guide is only relevant to Sites using Eleventy, Hugo, or Jekyll as their SSG.
