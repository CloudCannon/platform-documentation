<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Migrating your existing Site is optional. You can use CloudCannon's [live configuration and data editing feature](/documentation/guides/unified-configuration-migration-guide/live-configuration-and-data-editing/) without migrating your Site.
</comp.Notice>

## 1\. Explicitly configure attributes for file content Editable Regions

CloudCannon no longer automatically applies Editable Regions to file content without an explicit attribute. Previously, CloudCannon would attempt to discover these regions automatically when it encountered a content variable as the only child of an element, for example:

<comp.CodeBlock language="HTML" source="layout.html">
``````````
<div>{{ content }}</div>
``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

This markup detection was fragile in certain circumstances, and couldn't be explicitly toggled on or off.

For sites using Unified Configuration, CloudCannon will no longer discover these regions automatically. Instead, an explicit attribute now exists to add an Editable Region for the content of a file.

The below code shows how to configure the `data-cms-edit="content"` attribute to configure Editable Regions for your content:

<comp.CodeBlock language="HTML" source="layout.html">
``````````
<div data-cms-edit="content">{{ content }}</div>
``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

## 2\. Configure \_snippets\_imports

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  This step of the migration guide is only relevant to Sites using Hugo or Jekyll as their SSG.
</comp.Notice>

Add the `_snippets_imports` corresponding to your SSG:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````

_snippets_imports:
  jekyll: true

``````````
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````

_snippets_imports:
  hugo:
    exclude:
      - hugo_instagram

``````````
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

## 3\. Configure path.static

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  This step of the migration guide is only relevant to Sites using Hugo as their SSG.
</comp.Notice>

Set `path.static` to `static`.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````

paths:
  static: static

``````````
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>
