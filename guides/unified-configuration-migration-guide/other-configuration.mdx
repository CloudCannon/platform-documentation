<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  You may not need to complete every step in this guide but please carefully review each step to see if it is applicable to your Site's configuration.
</comp.Notice>

## 1\. Explicitly configure attributes for file content Editable Regions

CloudCannon no longer automatically applies Editable Regions to file content without an explicit attribute. Previously, CloudCannon would attempt to discover these regions automatically when it encountered a content variable as the only child of an element, for example:

<comp.CodeBlock language="HTML" source="layout.html">
``````````
<div>{{ content }}</div>
``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

This markup detection was fragile in certain circumstances, and couldn't be explicitly toggled on or off.

For sites using Unified Configuration, CloudCannon will no longer discover these regions automatically. Instead, an explicit attribute now exists to add an Editable Region for the content of a file.

The below code shows how to configure the `data-cms-edit="content"` attribute to configure Editable Regions for your content:

<comp.CodeBlock language="HTML" source="layout.html">
``````````
<div data-cms-edit="content">{{ content }}</div>
``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

## 2\. Configure \_snippets\_imports

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  This step of the migration guide is only relevant to Sites using Hugo or Jekyll as their SSG.
</comp.Notice>

Add the `_snippets_imports` corresponding to your SSG:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````

_snippets_imports:
  jekyll: true

``````````
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````

_snippets_imports:
  hugo:
    exclude:
      - hugo_instagram

``````````
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

## 3\. Configure path.static

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  This step of the migration guide is only relevant to Sites using Hugo as their SSG.
</comp.Notice>

CloudCannon no longer uses build integrations to set `path.static` automatically. Please set the `path.static` key to `static`.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````

paths:
  static: static
  uploads: static/uploads

``````````
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  To configure `paths.uploads`, you must also have configured `paths.static` first.
</comp.Notice>

## 4\. Configure your markdown engine

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  This step of the migration guide is only relevant to Sites using Jekyll as their SSG.
</comp.Notice>

CloudCannon supports two markdown engines: CommonMark and Kramdown. Because most SSGs use CommonMark, CloudCannon assumes you are using this engine by default in the Unified Configuration file format.

Jekyll is on of the few SSGs which use Kramdown by default. If your Site uses Kramdown, you must specify your markdown engine in your CloudCannon configuration file.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````

markdown:
  engine: kramdown
  options:
    xhtml: false
    breaks: false
    linkify: false
    typographer: false
    quotes:
    spaced_lists: false
    sentence_per_line: false
    gfm: false
    code_block_fences: '```'
    escape_snippets_in_code_blocks: false
    treat_indentation_as_code: false
    table: false
    strikethrough: false
    subscript: false
    superscript: false
    heading_ids: false
    attributes: false
    attribute_elements:

``````````
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

## 5\. Defunct configuration options

CloudCannon no longer uses some configuration options in the Unified Configuration file format. Although leaving these keys in your Site files will not harm your Site, they also will not function. If you want to maintain a clean configuration file, we recommend removing defunct configuration options.

We recommend deleting the following keys:

1. `paths.data`
2. `paths.collections`
3. `paths.layouts`
4. `paths.includes`
