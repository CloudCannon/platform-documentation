If you want to add a new file

&nbsp;

If you want to add a new file to a Collection, rather than edit an existing one, you can click the *\+ Add* button in the top right of your *Collection Browser*. The name of your Collection will affect what CloudCannon calls the option to add a file in the *\+ Add* button dropdown (e.g., *\+ Add Testimonial* in the "Testimonials" Collection). By default, CloudCannon will copy the layout of an existing file in your Collection.

We'll dive into configuring how CloudCannon adds new files to a Collection in the [Configure your Collections](/documentation/guides/configure-your-collections/) guide.

There are multiple ways to add files in CloudCannon. When you add a file to your site and [save your changes](/documentation/articles/save-your-changes/), CloudCannon will push the new file to your Git repository. This way, technical and non-technical team members can contribute to your Git repository.

## Create a new file in the collection browser

You can create a new collection file using the *\+ Add* button in the top right of the collection browser. The [\+ Add dropdown](/documentation/articles/configure-the-add-button-in-collections/) shows a list of available [Schemas](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-schema/) for this collection or a default file template if no Schemas are configured.

* **Schema** - A Schema is a preconfigured file template that will populate new files with matching front matter and contents. You can configure your *\+ Add* dropdown to list a library of Schemas for each collection.
* **Default file template** — If no Schemas are defined for a collection, CloudCannon will generate a default file template. The default template will copy the front matter (but not the contents) of the first alphabetical file in the collection. In the *\+ Add* dropdown, the default template will appear as “+ Add \[collection item\]”, for example, “+ Add Blog” for a collection named “Blog”.

To create a file in the collection browser:

1. Navigate to the location you want to create the file using the collection or File Browser.
2. Click the *\+ Add* button in the top right of the browser.
3. Select the Schema or template you want to use.

CloudCannon will open a new file in an editing interface and save it to the location open in your collection browser.

## Upload from the File Browser

Your File Browser uses the same file structure as your Git repository. You can upload an individual file or a folder of files using the *\+ Add* button in the top right of the files browser. Uploading a folder uploads all files inside it rather than the folder itself.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  The File Browser is not available to team members in the [Editor Default Permission Group](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/#editors) or [Clients](/documentation/articles/what-is-client-sharing/).
</comp.Notice>

To upload a file or folder from the File Browser:

1. Navigate to the location where you want to upload the file in your File Browser.
2. Click the *\+ Add* button in the top right of the browser and select *Upload files* or *Upload a folder*.
3. CloudCannon will open a local File Browser. Select the file or folder you want to upload.
4. Review the files you want to upload in the *Confirm your files* modal.
5. Click the *Confirm selection* button.

CloudCannon will upload your file or folder to the location open in your File Browser.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  When uploading files to CloudCannon, the maximum size per file is 50 MB. Files synced from a Git provider have no maximum size.
</comp.Notice>

Alternatively, you can also drag and drop files from your local computer into the CloudCannon File Browser to upload them to the location you have open.

## Clone a file

You can add a new file to your site by cloning an existing file. This method is useful if you need files with similar contents. You can also clone a folder to create a copy of every file in that folder.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If your workflow requires many files with similar contents, we recommend setting up a [Schema](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-schema/).
</comp.Notice>

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/editing/collections/2023-Q4/CloudCannon-Documentation-File-Context-Menu.png" alt="A closeup of the Collection Browser shows the option to 'Clone item' in the file Context Menu." title="Clone item option in the Context Menu" type="ui-snippet"/>

To clone a file or folder:

1. Navigate to the item you want to clone in your collection or File Browser.
2. Open the *Context Menu* by clicking the icon in the top right of the file card.
3. Select *Clone item/folder*.

CloudCannon will clone your file or folder. Cloned files and folders will have “-copy” added to the file or folder name. Filenames inside cloned folders will not change.

If you are cloning an individual file, CloudCannon will open that file in an editing interface.

Alternatively, you can clone a file from the editing interface using the *File menu* in the top left corner.
