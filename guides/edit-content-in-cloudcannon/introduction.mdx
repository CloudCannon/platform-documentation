description: Learn how to set up WYSIWYG editing for your website on CloudCannon.

Welcome to CloudCannon's Getting Started with Editing guide!

This guide is an excellent starting point for developers new to CloudCannon. We recommend that you complete this guide first, as other guides on the CloudCannon Documentation website may rely on the steps outlined here.

CloudCannon is a Git-based Content Management System designed to help teams (or individuals) manage their website content and code. Developers can commit changes to a Git repository that syncs to CloudCannon. At the same time, non-technical team members can effortlessly update and manage your content without knowing anything about Git, Markdown, or HTML. All your files are stored safely and securely in your Git repository â€” no vendor lock-in.

In this guide, we'll cover how to create an account, add your files to a *Site*, and set yourself up for success on CloudCannon. By the end of this guide, you will have set up a basic *Site* in CloudCannon, enabled WYSIWYG editing for your files, and learnt important skills for managing your content.

Before we begin, this guide assumes you already have a website and your files are uploaded to a Git repository. Although you can <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/create-a-site-with-direct-upload/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upload files directly</a> from your local storage, we highly recommend using a Git repository.
