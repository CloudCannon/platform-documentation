File actions are one method of editing your website content, allowing you to perform file-level actions like duplicating, deleting, or renaming. You can access file actions through the *Context Menu* in any *Collection Browser* or Editing Interface.

## The *Collection Browser*

When you look at the files in any *Collection Browser*, you can see a six-dot icon at the top right of each file Card (or the right if you use *List* view). This is the file *Context Menu* and *Drag* handle.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Context-Menu-Open-With" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows the file Context Menu is open with several options." title="The Collection Browser Context Menu" type="screenshot"/>

When you click on the six-dot icon, CloudCannon opens the *Context Menu*, which contains important file actions. File actions include:

* *Open with* — Open a file in one of CloudCannon's Editing Interfaces.
* *Open Source Folder* — Open the location of a file in the File Browser.
* *Copy Source Path* — Copy the file path for a file, relative to your Site source folder.
* *Move to new folder* — Create a new folder within your Collection and move a file to that folder.
* *Move up a folder* — Move a file to the folder above it in your Collection. Note: This option is not available if the file is at the top level of a Collection.
* *Duplicate* — Duplicate a file, and choose between creating an exact copy or updating any instance values in the front matter. CloudCannon will add "-copy" to the end of the file name.
* *Rename* — Rename a file by creating a copy of your file with the updated name and marking the old file for deletion the next time you save changes to your Site.
* *Delete* — Mark a file for deletion the next time you save changes to your Site.
* *Publish to posts* (Jekyll only) — Move a file to the "Posts" Collection.

If your *Collection* is output and you have a successful *Site* build, the following actions will also be available (we cover *Site* builds in [Set up Visual Editing](/documentation/guides/set-up-visual-editing) and [Host your website on the Internet](/documentation/guides/host-your-website)):

* *Open URL* — Open the live URL for an output file from your most recent build. This uses your Testing Domain.
* *Copy URL* — Copy the live URL for an output file from your most recent build. This uses your Testing Domain.

Finally, if the file has unsaved changes, the *Context Menu* will also contain the following file actions:

* *View diff* — Review unsaved changes for a file in text format, with deleted content highlighted in red and new content highlighted in green.
* *Discard unsaved changes* — Discard all unsaved changes to a file.

If you click and hold the six-dot icon, it acts as a *Drag* handle, allowing you to move a file Card around the screen, including into nested folders in your Collection.

## Editing interfaces

You can open a file in one of CloudCannon's editing interfaces by clicking on the file in the *Collection Browser*, or by using the *Open with* option from the *Context Menu*.

In each editing interface, the *Context Menu* is available from the *Site Header*. Clicking the three-dot icon will open the *Context Menu*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Content-Editor-Context-Menu" alt="A screenshot of the Content Editor shows the Context Menu open with several file actions available." title="The Content Editor" type="screenshot"/>

The *Open with* option is not available in the *Context Menu*; instead, the *Switch Interface* allows you to change which editing interface you are in.

In the next step of this guide, we'll cover the tools available for editing files in CloudCannon's editing interfaces: the Visual Editor, Content Editor, Data Editor, and Source Editor.
