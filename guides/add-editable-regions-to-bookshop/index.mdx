  Learn how to add Editable Regions to a Hugo, Eleventy, or Jekyll Site that
  uses Bookshop.

Welcome to CloudCannon's guide for adding *Editable Regions* to a Bookshop *Site*!

This guide covers everything you need to configure *Editable Regions* for a Hugo, Eleventy, or Jekyll *Site* that uses Bookshop.

<comp.DocsVideo url="https://player.vimeo.com/progressive_redirect/playback/1124969057/rendition/1080p/file.mp4?loc=external&signature=18a05ed71665768fa94851c72a31cf574e4079284b8ce0579885d8f3b47c4a8d" title="The Visual Editor with editable regions" autoplay={true} loop={true}/>

Traditionally, Bookshop uses data bindings and panels to enable content editing, which works well, but is not the same as editing your content in-line. By adding *Editable Regions* to your Bookshop *Site*, you can edit text directly on the page in the *Visual Editor*, click on images to update them, and add, remove, or reorder components and array items without a data panel.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p>You don't need to update Bookshop with <em>Editable Regions</em> if the traditional approach works for you. Adding <em>Editable Regions</em> enhances your Bookshop experience, but is not a requirement.</p>
</comp.Notice>

In this guide, we'll cover:

* How to update Bookshop to version 3.17.1
* How to update your post build command.
* How to add *Editable Regions* to your layout files, page templates, and components

Before we begin, this guide assumes that you already have a Hugo, Eleventy, or Jekyll *Site* that uses Bookshop component management, know the correct build settings for your *Site*, and are comfortable editing your *Site* in your local development environment.
