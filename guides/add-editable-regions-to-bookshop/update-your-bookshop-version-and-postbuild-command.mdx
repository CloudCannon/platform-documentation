  Learn how to update to Bookshop v3.17.1 and modify your postbuild command with
  the Editable Regions flag.
---
Bookshop version 3.17.1 supports integration with CloudCannon *Editable Regions*.

Th

registers all of your bookshop components as editable regions components using the bookshop name

bookshop will still manage your components and generate you structures from your bookshop yaml files.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  <p>Version 3.17.0 has a known issue with the visual editor loading state. Please use v3.17.1 or later.</p>
</comp.Notice>

## Update Bookshop

Before you can use *Editable Regions*, you will need to update Bookshop.

With your website project open in your local development environment, run the following command in your terminal:

<comp.CodeBlock language="">
``````````

npm update @bookshop/generate

``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

Alternatively, you can update your `package.json` file to specify the new version of Bookshop:

<comp.CodeBlock language="JavaScript" source="package.json">
``````````

{
  "dependencies": {
    "@bookshop/generate": "^3.17.1"
  }
}

``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

## Update your postbuild script

Next, we'll need to add the `--editable-regions` flag to the CloudCannon postbuild script.

<comp.CodeBlock language="" source=".cloudcannon/postbuild">
``````````

#!/usr/bin/env bash

npx @bookshop/generate --editable-regions

``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  <p>This flag also disables the traditional data binding panels.</p>
</comp.Notice>
