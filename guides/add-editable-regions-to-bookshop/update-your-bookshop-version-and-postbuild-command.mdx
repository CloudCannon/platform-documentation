  Learn how to update to Bookshop v3.17.1 and modify your postbuild command with
  the Editable Regions flag.
---
To use CloudCannon's *Editable Regions* on your Bookshop *Site*, you will need to update to Bookshop version 3.17.1 and update your post build to use the correct flag. Once you rebuild your *Site*, CloudCannon will register all your Bookshop components as *Editable Regions* components using their Bookshop name. Bookshop will still manage your components and generate structures from your Bookshop `.yml` files.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  <p>Although Bookshop version 3.17.0 is the minimum version required to support <em>Editable Regions</em> integration, it has a known issue with the visual editor loading state. Please use v3.17.1 or later.</p>
</comp.Notice>

## Update Bookshop

Before you can use *Editable Regions*, you will need to update Bookshop.

With your website project open in your local development environment, run the following command in your terminal:

<comp.CodeBlock language="">
``````````

npm update @bookshop/generate

``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

Alternatively, you can update your `package.json` file to specify the new version of Bookshop:

<comp.CodeBlock language="JavaScript" source="package.json">
``````````

{
  "dependencies": {
    "@bookshop/generate": "^3.17.1"
  }
}

``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

## Update your postbuild script

Next, we'll need to add the `--editable-regions` flag to the CloudCannon postbuild script.

<comp.CodeBlock language="" source=".cloudcannon/postbuild">
``````````

#!/usr/bin/env bash

npx @bookshop/generate --editable-regions

``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  <p>This flag also disables the traditional data binding panels. Once you add this flag, you will need to complete the remaining steps in this guide to get visual editing working again.</p>
</comp.Notice>

Once you rebuild your *Site*, CloudCannon is ready for you to begin adding *Editable Regions* to your files. In the next step of this guide, we'll cover how to add a Component *Editable Region* to Bookshop layout files.
