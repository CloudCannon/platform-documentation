Let's create an account on CloudCannon. If you already have a CloudCannon account, you can skip this step of the guide.

Open the [CloudCannon app](https://app.cloudcannon.com/register) in your Internet browser. You can log in with your email, or your GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab account. In this guide, we will create an account using our email.

Click on the *Sign up with email* button.

Enter your email in the *Email address* field and click *Enter*.

To validate your email address, CloudCannon will send a six-digit confirmation code to the email you provided. This validation email should arrive in your inbox quickly and will expire after 10 minutes.

Enter the code in the *Confirmation code* field and click *Continue*.

Once you have validated your email address, you can finish adding your account details, such as your first and last name, an account password, whether you are a developer or non-developer, and opting in for CloudCannon marketing emails.

Your password must be at least nine characters long.
