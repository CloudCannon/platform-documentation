At CloudCannon, we use Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) to manage our emails and calendars, as well as collaborate and share files through services like Google Drive. When new team members join, they receive access to our internal documentation websites, hosted through CloudCannon.

These sites are secured with SAML authentication through Google, ensuring only authorized CloudCannon members can access them. When someone on our team leaves (ðŸ˜­), disabling their Google Workspace account automatically revokes their access to the internal websites.

In this guide, we'll teach you how to create a SAML App in Google Admin Console and configure SAML authentication for a Site hosted through CloudCannon. As a bonus, we'll also teach you how to create authenticated routes, incase you want some parts of your website to remain available to the public, while others require authentication.

## What is SAML authentication?

SAML authentication is an excellent way to limit access to your website content to members of your team. SAML (or Security Assertion Markup Language) authentication requires visitors to your Site to log in with a third-party Single Sign-On ([SSO](/documentation/articles/what-is-sso-saml/)) account. By adding SAML authentication to your Site, you can control who is allowed to view your content.
