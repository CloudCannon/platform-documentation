At CloudCannon, we use Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) to manage our emails and calendars, as well as collaborate and share files through services like Google Drive. When new team members join, they receive access to our internal documentation and staging websites, hosted through CloudCannon.

These sites are secured with SAML authentication through Google, ensuring only authorized CloudCannon members can access them. When someone on our team leaves (ðŸ˜­), disabling their Google Workspace account automatically revokes their access to the internal websites.

You can use the same setup for your Site!

## What is SAML authentication?

SAML authentication is an excellent way to limit access to your website content to members of your team. SAML (or Security Assertion Markup Language) authentication requires visitors to your Site to log in with a third-party Single Sign-On ([SSO](/documentation/articles/what-is-sso-saml/)) account.

SAML authentication works by allowing CloudCannon to authenticate a user's identity with an Identity Provider software (in this case, Google Workspace) when they try to log in to your website.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  CloudCannon also supports SAML authentication for CloudCannon app access. This feature is available on our [Enterprise plan](/pricing/). If this is what you're looking for, please read our documentation on [SSO/SAML](/documentation/articles/what-is-sso-saml/) or reach out to our friendly [support team](/support/).
</comp.Notice>

To configure SAML authentication for your Site, you will need to generate a certificate through Google Workspace.

In this guide, we'll teach you how to create a SAML App in Google Admin Console and configure SAML authentication for a Site hosted through CloudCannon. As a bonus, we'll also teach you how to create authenticated routes if you want some parts of your website to remain publicly available while others require authentication.

This guide assumes you already have a Site hosted on CloudCannon.
