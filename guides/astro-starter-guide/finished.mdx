That’s it for the base Astro setup. Your Data Editor will still be using the automatic configuration. If you find that some inputs could be improved, be sure to check out [how to configure inputs](/documentation/articles/how-to-choose-what-input-is-used-in-the-data-editor/).

Now that you are happy with the experience as a developer, you can share it with your team or clients. If you have an internal team, see [team sharing](/documentation/articles/managing-your-team-members/). If you have a client, see [client sharing](/documentation/articles/giving-clients-access-to-update-a-site/). If you need more information, check out our [SSO/SAML support](/documentation/articles/using-sso-to-create-team-accounts/).

If you experience any issues with your Astro build, don’t hesitate to contact our support team.
