    ### Snippets

    CloudCannon supports embedding rich Snippets in Markdown files when using the Content Editor. Snippets appear as blocks in your rich text view, and once configured, the Snippets icon in your WYSIWYG toolbar will provide a modal menu for your content team to select from.

    To get started with Snippets, read our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/editing-with-mdx-components/#custom-mdx-components">Custom MDX Components guide</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/support/">reach out to our support team</a>.
