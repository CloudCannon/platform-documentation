    ## Visual Editor Previews

    In a previous section of this guide, we talked about the Visual Editor — an intuitive way to edit your site by clicking directly on a preview of your page. But how do you make each region editable in the Visual Editor?

    ### Bookshop

    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop/">Bookshop</a> is our open-source tool to automate maintaining page components for page building. Using Bookshop, your team can update the front matter of each page component in the Visual Editor. CloudCannon will re-render your page as changes occur, generating a preview of your page as you edit.

    To get started with Bookshop, read our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/guides/bookshop-astro-guide/">Astro Bookshop guide</a>, or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/support/">reach out to our support team</a>.
