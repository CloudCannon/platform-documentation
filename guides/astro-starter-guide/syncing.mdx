The first step for connecting any site is to get your file system linked to CloudCannon. CloudCannon will need to clone your files to disk before anything else â€” this is the same process as if you were working locally in your development environment.

CloudCannon offers multiple ways of connecting your files:

1. Git syncing through [GitHub](/documentation/articles/connecting-a-github-repository-as-your-source/), [Bitbucket](/documentation/articles/connecting-a-bitbucket-respository-as-your-source/), [GitLab](/documentation/articles/connecting-a-gitlab-respository-as-your-source/) and [self-hosted GitLab](/documentation/articles/connecting-a-self-hosted-gitlab-repository-as-your-source/).
2. [Uploading a folder or zip of your files](/documentation/articles/add-files-with-direct-upload/).

It is highly recommended that you use the Git syncing option. This allows your updates on CloudCannon to push back to your repository. Your editors can then contribute to the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This step is configured through an OAuth connection with the relevant partner. Check out the [Connecting Your First Site](/documentation/articles/connecting-your-first-site/) guide for more information on this step.
