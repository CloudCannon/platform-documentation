Visual editing on CloudCannon can be broken down into two separate parts:

1. [Previews](/documentation/articles/using-live-editing-with-vanilla-js/)\: When data is changed in a data editor, the new changes are visible immediately on the page. You can achieve this by using Astro's client-side hydration to include JavaScript on your site that listens for changes in CloudCannon and updates your content automatically.
2. [Bindings](/documentation/articles/what-are-visual-data-bindings/)\: Tagging elements on the page tells CloudCannon where the data came from. CloudCannon can then attach a UI to those parts directly on the page. This frees the editor from using the Data Editor in the sidebar.

The final result is something intuitive and easy to teach.
