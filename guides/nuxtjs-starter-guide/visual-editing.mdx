Visual editing on CloudCannon can be broken down into two separate parts:

1. [Previews](/documentation/articles/live-editing-with-vue/)\: When data (such as front matter) is changed in the Data Editor, the new values are sent to the page props.
Vue components can re-render themselves when their data changes, which means we can create components that update live in the Visual Editor.
2. [Bindings](/documentation/articles/what-are-visual-data-bindings/)\: Tagging elements on the page tells CloudCannon where the data came from.
CloudCannon can then attach a UI to those parts directly on the page. This frees the editor from using the Data Editor in the sidebar.

The final result is something intuitive and easy to teach to the rest of your team.
