The first step for connecting any site is to get your file system linked to CloudCannon. CloudCannon will need to clone your files to disk before anything else â€” this is the same process as if you were working locally in your dev environment.

CloudCannon offers multiple ways of connecting your files:

1. Git syncing through [GitHub](/documentation/articles/connecting-a-github-repository-as-your-source/), [Bitbucket](/documentation/articles/connecting-a-bitbucket-respository-as-your-source/), [GitLab](/documentation/articles/connecting-a-gitlab-respository-as-your-source/) and [self-hosted GitLab](/documentation/articles/connecting-a-self-hosted-gitlab-repository-as-your-source/)
2. [Uploading a folder or zip of your files](/documentation/articles/add-files-with-direct-upload/)

It is highly recommended that you use the Git syncing option. This allows CloudCannon to pull the latest updates to your repository, and to push your changes back - keeping your team in sync.
This step is configured through an OAuth connection with the relevant Git provider.
Check out the [Connecting Your First Site](/documentation/articles/connecting-your-first-site/) guide for more information on this step.
