      **Common Next.js Build Errors**

      Your build needs to output static files for CloudCannon to work correctly.

      If you are using Next.js v13.3.0 and above, you must add output: 'export' to your next.config.js file. Read the [Next.js documentation on Static Exports](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) for more information.

      For Next.js versions earlier than v13.3.0, you should add next export to your build command instead. For example, the build script in your package.json could be next build && next export.

    ## CloudCannon Reader

    If you're reading your build logs in CloudCannon, you'll see a build step that runs `@cloudcannon/reader` after your SSG. 

    CloudCannon Reader is the tool that scans your global configuration file and processes your collections. This tool runs automatically, so there isn't anything you need to do.

    If you want to look under the hood or customize your config further, Reader is open-source on GitHub at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/reader">CloudCannon/reader</a>.
