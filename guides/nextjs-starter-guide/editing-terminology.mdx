    Some SSGs, like Jekyll, Hugo, Astro, and Eleventy, have strong opinions about how to organize the content in your repository. CloudCannon can run automatic processes on these SSGs and provide basic editing out-of-the-box. Next.js takes a less opinionated approach and allows you to decide where and how content is stored. This means that for Next.js, CloudCannon’s out-of-the-box options only include the source editor.

    CloudCannon has a few concepts that make organizing data easier:
  </comp.SlotContent> <comp.SlotContent name="SSG_Collection_Terminology">
    Fortunately, these terms align with the [Next.js concepts of Data Fetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching). More specifically:

    * [getStaticProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) (Static Generation): Fetch data at build time.
    * [getStaticPaths](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation) (Static Generation): Specify [dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes) to pre-render pages based on data.

    Next.js can implement both of these calls for either Data or Collections. With a Collection, `getStaticProps` would pull in a single file, and `getStaticPaths` would pull in each file as a path. With Data, `getStaticProps` would pull in the whole file or an array item within it, and `getStaticPaths` would return nothing or each item in an array. We recommend you use Collections when implementing `getStaticPaths`.

    ## Updating Next.js to use file data

    Now that we have the terminology, it’s time to organize our content. Most of the Next.js documentation is weighted towards using a fetch for your [getStaticProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) and [getStaticPaths](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation).

    CloudCannon edits content stored in its local file system. This means we need to alter the fetch to use an `fs` call instead of `fetch`. For example, in your page file, use the following:

    <comp.CodeBlock language="Javascript" source="">
    ```
    export async function getStaticProps(context) {
    	const buffer = await fs.promises.readFile('config.json')
    	const data = JSON.parse(buffer.toString('utf8'))

    	return {
    		props: { data }
    	}
    }
    ```
    </comp.CodeBlock>

    Next.js documentation refers to this under [Data Fetching: Reading files](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#reading-files-use-processcwd). The same process will need to happen for any calls to `getStaticPaths`.

    It’s time to organize our content.

    To get the most out of CloudCannon, it's best to make sure your content is separate from your templating and routing logic. We recommend storing your page content in files using one of the file formats listed above. Markdown with front matter is a great choice for storing content because the front matter can be easily edited in the Data Editor and the Markdown content Content Editor.

    We recommend one content file per page, organized within a `content/` folder.

    With your content nicely organized, you'll then need to fetch this data into your page components. CloudCannon has an open-source package called [Filer](https://github.com/cloudcannon/filer), which lets you easily pull data from your content files and collections.

    For example, in a&nbsp;`pages/blog/[slug].jsx` (or equivalent) you could fetch your matching `content/blog/slug.md` file data like so:

  </comp.SlotContent>
</comp.CommonContent>
