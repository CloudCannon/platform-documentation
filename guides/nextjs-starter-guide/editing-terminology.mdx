    Some SSGs, like Jekyll, Hugo, Astro, and Eleventy, have strong opinions about how to organize the content in your repository. CloudCannon can run automatic processes on these SSGs and provide basic editing out-of-the-box. Next.js takes a less opinionated approach and allows you to decide where and how content is stored. This means that for Next.js, CloudCannon’s out-of-the-box options only include the source editor.

    CloudCannon has a few concepts that make organizing data easier:

    Fortunately, these terms align with the [Next.js concepts of Data Fetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching). More specifically:

    * [getStaticProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) (Static Generation): Fetch data at build time.
    * [getStaticPaths](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation) (Static Generation): Specify [dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes) to pre-render pages based on data.

    Next.js can implement both of these calls for either Data or Collections. With a Collection, `getStaticProps` would pull in a single file, and `getStaticPaths` would pull in each file as a path. With Data, `getStaticProps` would pull in the whole file or an array item within it, and `getStaticPaths` would return nothing or each item in an array. We recommend you use Collections when implementing `getStaticPaths`.

    ## Updating Next.js to use file data

    Now that we have the terminology, it’s time to organize our content. Most of the Next.js documentation is weighted towards using a fetch for your [getStaticProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) and [getStaticPaths](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation).

    CloudCannon edits content stored in its local file system. This means we need to alter the fetch to use an&nbsp;`fs` call instead of `fetch`. For example, in your page file, use the following:

  </comp.SlotContent>
</comp.CommonContent>
