    * Any required environment variables.
    * Install Command: Configure the command to install dependencies before the build. By default, this runs `npm install`. This is run as a line of bash and can be anything you want. A common change here is to use `yarn install` instead.
    * Build Command: Configure the command to build your site. By default, this runs `npm run build`. An example of this command is `next build`.
    * Output Path: Configure the path to the output folder you are building into. CloudCannon needs to know which folder to treat as the static output of your site. By default, Next.js writes its [static export](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) into the `out` folder.

      **Common Next.js Build Errors**

      Your build needs to output static files for CloudCannon to work correctly.

      If you are using Next.js v13.3.0 and above, you must add output: 'export' to your next.config.js file. Read the [Next.js documentation on Static Exports](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) for more information.

      For Next.js versions earlier than v13.3.0, you should add next export to your build command instead. For example, the build script in your package.json could be next build && next export.
