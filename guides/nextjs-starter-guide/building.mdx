  This guide will walk through the steps required to get your Next.js site
  built, editable and live on CloudCannon.

The second step for any new site is to get a successful build. This also mirrors your local development environment. On CloudCannon, select Next.js as your SSG — this will set up the defaults for Next.js.

The important things to configure here are:

* Any required Environment Variables.
* Install Command: Command to install dependencies before build. By default this runs `npm install`. This is run as a line of bash and can be anything you want. A common change here is to use `yarn install` instead.
* Build Command: Command to build your site. By default this runs `npm run build`. This is similar to the install command. An example of this build is `next build`.
* Output Path: Path to the output folder you are building into. This is important because CloudCannon needs to know which folder to treat as the static output of your site.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Your build needs to output static files in order for CloudCannon to work correctly.

  If you are using Next.js `v13.3.0` and above, you **must** add `output: 'export'` to your `next.config.js` file.
  Read the [Next.js documentation on Static Exports](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) for more information.

  For Next.js versions earlier than `v13.3.0`, you should instead add `next export` to your build command.
  For example, the build script in your `package.json` could be `next build && next export`.

Ideally your build will work the first time. If this is the case, you can move to the next step. If your build did not work the first time, be sure to read the build output — this will let you know what didn't work.

You may find you need extra commands to complete your build. A common example is using postcss; for this you can use build hooks, adding specially named bash scripts that run at different steps in the build. For more information, see [the build hook documentation](/documentation/articles/extending-your-build-process-with-hooks/).

#### Interlude: Your site is built

Once your site is built, you will see a big green tick on the screen. At this point, your site’s files are synced and a successful build has been run. This means you have unlocked a newly generated preview URL. In the top left corner of the screen under your site name, there is a blue link, styled *adjective-noun.cloudvent.net*. Clicking this link will open a new tab to the hosted site on CloudCannon. It is a helpful step at this point to check that the site looks correct. If it does, you can move on to editor configuration. If you need to update your build, this can be done in your settings.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If you find the site returned a 404 on the index, you might have set the wrong output path. This can be a sign that no files were present in the configured folder.

#### Interlude: Editing terminology

Some SSGs, like Jekyll, Hugo, and Eleventy, have strong opinions about how to organize the content in your repo. CloudCannon can run automatic processes on these SSGs and provide basic editing out of the box. Next.js takes a less opinionated approach and allows you to decide where and how content is stored. This means that for Next.js, CloudCannon out of the box only has the source editor available.

CloudCannon has a few concepts that make organizing data easier:

* **Data**\: These are standalone data files. This is ideal for site configuration or files that don't need to repeat. Data is edited by altering a single file.
* **Collections**\: A folder of files that represent a repeatable data format. This is a good fit for pages, blogs, staff members, recipes, etc. Collections are edited by altering any file or adding more files.

Fortunately, these terms align with the [Next.js concepts of Data Fetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching). More specifically:

* [getStaticProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) (Static Generation): Fetch data at **build time**.
* [getStaticPaths](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation) (Static Generation): Specify [dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes) to pre-render pages based on data.

Next.js can implement both of these calls with either **Data** or **Collections**. With a **Collection** `getStaticProps` would pull in a single file, and `getStaticPaths` would pull in each file as a path. With **Data**, `getStaticProps` would pull in the whole file or an array item within it, and`getStaticPaths` would return nothing or each item in an array. It is recommended that Collections are used when implementing `getStaticPaths`.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  CloudCannon does not support Server-side Rendering as our build and hosting environments are decoupled.
</comp.Notice>

CloudCannon supports a set of file formats for files in Data or Collections:

* Structured data files: JSON, YAML, TOML, CSV, TSV
* Markup files: HTML, Markdown
* Combination files: HTML with front matter, Markdown with front matter

Front matter refers to a section at the top of a markup file that contains structured data. CloudCannon supports JSON, YAML and TOML front matter. Markdown comes in many flavours, so be sure to checkout configuring your Markdown engine.

*<u><strong>If you need another supported format, please contact support and we would be happy to look into it.</strong></u>*
