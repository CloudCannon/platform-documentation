If you want some parts of your website to require authentication and other parts to be publicly accessible, CloudCannon allows you to configure authenticated routes. You can control which pages, or groups of pages require authentication.

As we have already set our authentication method to SAML in the previous section of this guide, all the authenticated routes you configure will require visitors to sign in with their Google Workspace credentials.

## Create a list of paths that require authentication

You can specify which URLs on your Site require authentication using the URL path. URL paths are made up of zero or more subdirectories and the slug for the current web page. You can use the wildcard `*` character to specify any number of

For this guide, we want to configure authentication for every page in the "Staff" section of our website, and the "Internal Announcements" page. The URLs for these pages are `https://example.com/staff/*` and `https://example.com/internal-announcements.html`.

We only need the path information to create authenticated routes, so we can remove the domain name from the URLs to leave the following:

* `/staff/*`
* `/internal-announcements.html`

## Configure authenticated routes

&nbsp;

**An authenticated route is a URL that requires visitors to authenticate their identity before they can see the content.**

**When you** [**enable password authentication**](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/enable-password-authentication/)**,** [**enable user account authentication**](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/enable-user-account-authentication/)**, or** [**enable SAML authentication**](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/enable-saml-authentication/)**, CloudCannon requires authentication on all routes by default. However, you can specify authenticated routes to require authentication for specific parts of your Site. For example, you could require password authentication for a "Staff Only" section of your website while the other pages remain publicly available.**

**You can specify which routes should use authentication in an `auth-routes.txt` file. This file should be in the root directory of your output Site. Where this is in your Site repository will depend on your SSG (e.g., the root of the repository for Jekyll, the static folder for Hugo, etc.).**

**To specify authenticated routes:**

1. **Navigate to the root directory of your output Site using the** ***File browser***\*\*.\*\*
2. **Create a file called `auth-routes.txt`.**
3. **For each URL you want to authenticate, add the route on a new line of the file.**
4. **Save your page to your Site.**
5. **Navigate to the** ***Authentication*** **page under** ***Site Settings***\*\*.\*\*
6. **Enable password, user account, or SAML authentication.**

**CloudCannon will apply the authentication method you select to the routes specified in the `auth-routes.txt` file.**

**You can use the `*` character in a route to specify multiple subfolders or files.**

**Here is an example of a basic authenticated routes file:**

**auth-routes.txt**

/internal-news.html
/staff/*
