The purpose of the *Collection Browser* is to enable you to view, sort, and find the files in your Collection. By making the files in your *Collection Browser* easier to identify, you and your team will be more efficient at managing your content.

We can configure the appearance for each file Card, as well as the view and sorting options for the *Collection Browser*. Between these options, you can create several different appearances for your files in CloudCannon.

Open the *Collection Browser* of the Collection you want to configure and turn on *Configuration Mode* using the switch on the right of your *Site Header*. Purple *Edit configuration* buttons will appear, and several existing UI elements will be highlighted in purple.

When you are happy with your configuration, don't forget to save your changes to the `cloudcannon.config.yml` file using the *Save* button in your *Site Header*.

## What are file Cards?

Your files occupy the majority of the UI in each *Collection Browser*. Every file is represented by a Card, a square user interface element that previews information about a file.
