description: Learn how to configure your Collections for a better editing experience.
---
Welcome to the Configure your Collections guide!

A Collection is a group of related files with a similar format (e.g., a folder of pages, blog posts, or data files). Collections are a core part of your CloudCannon CMS experience. In general, when you or a team member wants to edit a file in CloudCannon, you click on a Collection in your *Site Navigation* to open the *Collection Browser* and search for the correct file to open in one of CloudCannon's editing interfaces. Configuring a Collection can streamline this process and improve your team's efficiency.

In CloudCannon, you configure each Collection separately, allowing you to create a custom experience for each Collection.

In this guide, we'll cover how to:

* Update your Collection details, including the name, icon, description, and documentation link.
* Configure the way your file Cards look in the *Collection Browser*.
* Configure the way CloudCannon adds new files to your Collection.
* Configure which editing interfaces are allowed for files in your Collection.
* Configure the output URL for files in your Collection.

This guide matches the *Configure your Collections* task on the *Getting Started* task list. Completing any of the configuration options outlined in this guide and saving them to your `cloudcannon.config.yml` file will mark this task as completed on your *Site Dashboard*.

Before we begin, this guide assumes you already have a Site on CloudCannon with at least one Collection that contains files, and you are familiar with Configuration Mode. Additionally, some parts of this guide will differ depending on whether CloudCannon builds your Site or your Site is in Headless Mode. We'll point out these sections so you know what applies to your Site.
