What is the Visual Editor?

## What are CloudCannon Editables?

CloudCannon Editables are attributes you can add to any DOM element on your website, including files that contain HTML templating, structured data, or markup content. After your next successful build, CloudCannon will re-render elements with Editable attributes in the Visual Editor as needed. Editables are available for all SSGs that CloudCannon supports.

With Editables configured, you can click directly on a preview of your webpage and edit inline content.

CloudCannon Editables also support page building. You can add new components to a page, remove old ones, and reorganize your components live on a preview of your webpage, at any time.

<comp.DocsVideo url="" title="" autoplay={true} loop={true}/>

## Overview

Your existing Astro site likely has:

* Markdown files with YAML frontmatter (`.md` files)
* Astro components (`.astro` files)
* Content collections or individual pages
* Static assets and styling

CloudCannon Editables will let your content editors:

* Edit frontmatter fields visually
* Edit markdown content with a rich text editor
* Add/remove items from arrays in frontmatter
* Upload and manage images
* Edit content without touching code

## Install CloudCannon Editables

Let's install the CloudCannon Editables package. Add the following code to the **X file in your website.**

<comp.CodeBlock language="">
``````````

npm install @cloudcannon/editables

``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

In the next step of this guide, we'll configure editable front matter fields in the Visual Editor.
