  Learn how to configure CloudCannon Editables for your 
  HTML-like files, such as a Home or About page.
---
For most static websites, webpages generated by a collection of content files and a layout only represent a portion of your website. Other pages, like a "Home" or "About" page, might come from a single file with HTML-like content (the exact format of your pages will differ depending on which SSG you use).

Here's an example of a Home page for a blog website.

<comp.CodeBlock language="Astro" source="index.astro">

When you first open `index.astro` in the Visual Editor, there is nothing for your to interact with (with no structured data keys in front matter, CloudCannon can't even provide any Inputs in the sidebar). Let's fix that by adding CloudCannon Editables to this file.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

In this step of the guide, we'll add the following attributes:

* `data-editable` ‚Äî This attribute defines the type of data inside an Editable.
* `data-path` ‚Äî This attribute defines the path to the file you want to edit.
* `data-key` ‚Äî This attribute defines a unique identifier for an editable region within the file, which CloudCannon requires even if you don't have several discreet editable regions.

For a complete list of configuration options for CloudCannon Editables, please read our [Editables reference](/documentation/articles/editables-reference) documentation.

## Editing HTML **or template source code**

The Home page is mostly comprised of text inside `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<ul>` tags. Let's enable editing in the Visual Editor by adding the attributes `data-editable`, `data-path`, and `data-key` to the `<main>` tag.

To define what type of data we are editing, we need to add the `data-editable` attribute to the `<main>` tag. This time the value should be `source`, as the `<main>` tag contains nested HTML as well as text. We could also wrap the `<main>` element in the equivalent web component `<source-editables>`, however that is not as efficient as adding attributes to existing elements.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p>When using <code>data-editable="source"</code>, CloudCannon also requires you to define the <code>data-path</code> and <code>data-key</code> attributes.</p>
</comp.Notice>

The `data-path` attribute is similar to `data-prop`; it defines the location that data is stored. However, unlike the changes we made to the blog layout file in the [previous step of this guide](/documentation/guides/configure-visual-editing/editing-content-files/), our Home page stores text directly within the HTML elements, not in a structured data key. We want CloudCannon to update the value of this file every time we edit it in the Visual Editor, so let's make the value the path of the file: `/src/pages/index.astro`.

The `data-key` attribute acts as a unique identifier for an editable region. This means if you have several editable regions in one file, CloudCannon knows which value to update. We recommend choosing a key that provides context for which area of your code an editable region affects. In this example, we'll use the value `main`.

Here's what our Home page code should look like:

<comp.CodeBlock language="Astro" source="index.astro">
``````````

<main data-editable="source" data-path="/src/pages/index.astro" data-key="main"> /*1*/

``````````
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  This `<img>` element contains image width, height, source, and alt text attributes. The `src` attribute is set to the template `{heroImage}`, which draws its value from the `heroImage` key in the front matter of a blog file.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>

If we save and rebuild our Site, a yellow editable box will appear around the content on the Home page in the Visual Editor, enabling inline editing.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

## Plain text vs rich text

You might notice that a WYSIWYG toolbar appears above your content when you click into the editable region to support rich text formatting. This behavior is defined by the `data-type` attribute or, if the `data-type` attribute is not defined as in the above example, CloudCannon has a few way of automatically determining whether content is plain text or rich text.

* `data-type` ‚Äî This attribute defines the element type and editing behavior.

The `data-type` attribute can take three values: `span`, `text`, and `block`.

Setting `data-type="span"` does not allow any rich text formatting, while `data-type="text"` allows paragraph-level rich text formatting such as bold, italics, and links. Setting `data-type="block"` allows all rich text formatting options, from paragraph-level to block-level formatting like lists, block-quotes, images, snippets, and text styling.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p>If you want to specify exactly which formatting tools are available, you can manually define your WYSIWYG toolbar under the <code>_editables</code> key in your CloudCannon Configuration File. For more information, please read our documentation on <a href="/documentation/articles/configure-your-rich-text-editors/#editable-regions">Configuring your rich text editors</a>.</p>
</comp.Notice>

Allowing rich text formatting in an element that can only support plain text can be destructive to your content and HTML. To prevent this, CloudCannon uses other information about the element to determine if allowing rich text formatting is appropriate when `data-type` isn't defined.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/guides/configure-visual-editing/2025-08/CloudCannon-Documentation-Editables-Data-Type-Flowchart.png" alt="An illustration of the flowchart CloudCannon uses to decide if rich text formatting is appropriate for an element." title="The Data Type Flowchart" type="ui-snippet"/>

Firstly, CloudCannon determines whether the Editable affects is in content or front matter. Content is anything using `data-attribute="source"` or `<source-editable>`, or any `data-attribute="text"` or `<text-editable>` where `data-prop="@content"`. Front matter is any `data-attribute="text"` or `<text-editable>` where `data-prop` is set to a structured data key.

For content

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

CloudCannon will determine the correct behavior based on the location of the element (i.e., content or front matter), and the element type if it is in HTML (e.g., `<p>` tags vs `<h1>` tags) or Input type configuration if it is in front matter.

If the

&nbsp;

use the default behavior for the Editable.

The default `data-type` for `data-editable="text"` and the equivalent web component `<text-editable>` is `span`.

&nbsp;

You can also manually define

&nbsp;

heading elements don't support block level content

You can get a WYSIWYG toolbar for structured data keys if your configure your input to be a markdown type.

&nbsp;

* `data-type` - Element type for editing behavior
  * `"span"` - Inline text editing (default for `<text-editable>`)
  * `"text"` - Paragraph-level text editing
  * `"block"` - Full rich-text editing with multiple paragraphs

I've noticed that when we added `<main data-editable="source" data-path="/src/pages/index.astro" data-key="main">` a WYSIWYG toolbar appeared above the content, but `data-type` wasn't configured and its not a rich text input Does CC automatically detect it should be rich text?

&nbsp;

Yeah there's a few layers of detection that go into which toolbar you get there, for the content flavoured editables (i.e the ones that aren't inputs so source editables or text editables with `data-prop=@content`) it'll be either the configured `data-type` attribute or pick whichever one is most appropriate for the html element. In this case, `main` is a block level element so you get the block toolbar. If it were an `h1` instead, for example, you'd only get the text toolbar
