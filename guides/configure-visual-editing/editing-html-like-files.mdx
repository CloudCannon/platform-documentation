  Learn how to configure CloudCannon Editables for your 
  HTML-like files, such as a Home or About page.
---
For most static websites, webpages generated by a collection of content files and a layout only represent a portion of your website. Other pages, like a "Home" or "About" page, will come from a single file with HTML-like content (the exact format of your pages will differ depending on which SSG you use).

Here's an example of a Home page for a blog website.

<comp.CodeBlock language="Astro" source="index.astro">

import Footer from '../components/Footer.astro';

<comp.Annotation number="1">
  This `<img>` element contains image width, height, source, and alt text attributes. The `src` attribute is set to the template `{heroImage}`, which draws its value from the `heroImage` key in the front matter of a blog file.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>

When you first open `index.astro` in the Visual Editor, there is nothing for your to interact with (with no structured data keys in front matter, CloudCannon can't even provide any Inputs in the sidebar). Let's fix that by adding CloudCannon Editables to this file.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

In this step of the guide, we'll add the following attributes:

* `data-editable` ‚Äî This attribute defines the type of data inside an Editable.
* `data-path` ‚Äî This attribute defines the path to the file you want to edit.
* `data-key` ‚Äî This attribute defines a unique identifier for an editable region within the file, which CloudCannon requires even if you don't have several discreet editable regions.

For a complete list of configuration options for CloudCannon Editables, please read our [Editables reference](/documentation/articles/editables-reference) documentation.

## Editing HTML **or template source code**

The Home page is mostly comprised of text inside `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<ul>` tags. Let's enable editing in the Visual Editor by adding the attributes `data-editable`, `data-path`, and `data-key` to the `<main>` tag.

To define what type of data we are editing, we need to add the `data-editable` attribute to the `<main>` tag. This time the value should be `source`, as the `<main>` tag has nested HTML as well as text. We could also wrap the `<main>` element in the equivalent web component `<source-editables>`, however that is not as efficient as adding attributes to existing elements.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p>When using <code>data-editable="source"</code>, CloudCannon also requires you to define the <code>data-path</code> and <code>data-key</code> attributes.</p>
</comp.Notice>

The `data-path` attribute is similar to `data-prop`; it defines the location that data is stored. However, unlike the changes we made to the blog layout file in the [previous step of this guide](/documentation/guides/configure-visual-editing/editing-content-files/), our Home page stores text directly within the HTML elements, not in a structured data key. We want CloudCannon to update the value of this file every time we edit in the Visual Editor, so let's make the value the path of the file: `/src/pages/index.astro`.

The `data-key` attribute acts as a unique identifier for an editable region. This means if you have several editable regions in one file, CloudCannon knows which value to update. We recommend choosing a key that provides context for which area of your code an editable region affects. In this example, we'll use the value `main`.

Here's what our Home page code should look like:

<comp.CodeBlock language="Astro" source="index.astro">
``````````

<main data-editable="source" data-path="/src/pages/index.astro" data-key="main"> /*1*/

``````````
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  This `<img>` element contains image width, height, source, and alt text attributes. The `src` attribute is set to the template `{heroImage}`, which draws its value from the `heroImage` key in the front matter of a blog file.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>

If we save and rebuild our Site, a yellow editable box will appear around the content on the Home page in the Visual Editor, enabling inline editing.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

You might notice that a WYSIWYG toolbar appears above your content when you click into the editable region.

&nbsp;

heading elements don't support block level content

You can get a WYSIWYG toolbar for structured data keys if your configure your input to be a markdown type.
