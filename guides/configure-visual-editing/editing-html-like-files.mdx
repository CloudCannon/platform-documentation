  Learn how to configure CloudCannon Editables for your 
  HTML-like files, such as a Home or About page.
---
For most static websites, webpages generated by a collection of content files and a layout only represent a portion of your website. Other pages, like a "Home" or "About" page, will come from a single file with HTML-like content (the exact format of your pages will differ depending on which SSG you use).

Here's an example of a Home page for a blog website.

<comp.CodeBlock language="Astro" source="index.astro">

import Footer from '../components/Footer.astro';
import Header from '../components/Header.astro';
import { SITE_DESCRIPTION, SITE_TITLE } from '../consts';

			<h1>üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Hello, Astronaut!</h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to the official <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> blog starter template. This
				template serves as a lightweight, minimally-styled starting point for anyone looking to build
				a personal website, blog, or portfolio with Astro.
			</p>
			<p>
				This template comes with a few integrations already configured in your
				<code>astro.config.mjs</code> file. You can customize your setup with
				<a href="https://astro.build/integrations">Astro Integrations</a> to add tools like Tailwind,
				React, or Vue to your project.
			</p>
			<p>Here are a few ideas on how to get started with the template:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Edit this page in <code>src/pages/index.astro</code></li>
				<li>Edit the site header items in <code>src/components/Header.astro</code></li>
				<li>Add your name to the footer in <code>src/components/Footer.astro</code></li>
				<li>Check out the included blog posts in <code>src/content/blog/</code></li>
				<li>Customize the blog post page layout in <code>src/layouts/BlogPost.astro</code></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Have fun! If you get stuck, remember to
				<a href="https://docs.astro.build/">read the docs</a>
				or <a href="https://astro.build/chat">join us on Discord</a> to ask questions.

<comp.Annotation number="1">
  This `<img>` element contains image width, height, source, and alt text attributes. The `src` attribute is set to the template `{heroImage}`, which draws its value from the `heroImage` key in the front matter of a blog file.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>

When you first open `index.astro` in the Visual Editor, there is nothing for your to interact with (with no structured data keys in front matter, CloudCannon can't even provide any Inputs in the sidebar). Let's fix that by adding CloudCannon Editables to this file.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

In this step of the guide, we'll add the following attributes:

* `data-editable=""` ‚Äî
* `data-path=""` ‚Äî This attribute defines the path to the file you want to edit.
* `data-key=""` ‚Äî T

For a complete list of configuration options for CloudCannon Editables, please read our [Editables reference](/documentation/articles/editables-reference) documentation.

## Text in your front matter

In our example above, there are two text front matter keys we want to edit: `title` and `author`.

<main data-editable"source" data-path="/src/pages/index.astro" data-key="main"> /*1*/
