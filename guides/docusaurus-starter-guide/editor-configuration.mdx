    ## Snippets

    It is easy to supplement your Markdown content with React components, building an interactive page editing experience for you team — all without touching the underlying code. Snippets are structured components which you can create and edit to suit your needs. You can create your own custom Snippets with our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/snippets-using-mdx-components/#custom-mdx-components">Custom MDX Components guide</a>, but for now let’s import the default MDX Snippets configurations.

    Currently, you cannot configure Snippets through the Configuration GUI, however, it is easy to do manually. Navigate to your CloudCannon global configuration file through the Files tab in your navigation sidebar. The configuration file will be in the root of your directory.

    Docusaurus uses both regular MDX components along with custom extensions, so we can import both the `mdx` Snippets and the `docusaurus_mdx` Snippets.

    Your `_snippets_imports` should look something like this:

    <comp.CodeBlock language="YAML" source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
    ```
    _snippets_imports:
      mdx: true
      docusaurus_mdx: true
    ```
    </comp.CodeBlock>
