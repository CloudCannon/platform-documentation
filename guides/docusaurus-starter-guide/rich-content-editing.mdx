When writing content with Docusaurus, you can use MDX to build rich, interactive pages by including your React components
directly alongside your Markdown content. With CloudCannon Snippets you can integrate your
MDX files and React components with the CloudCannon Content Editor. This means you get clean and intuitive Markdown
editing with the power to create and edit structured components â€” all without
touching the underlying code.
