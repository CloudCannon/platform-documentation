Docusaurus is a content-based, JavaScript static-site generator with a focus on building optimized documentation websites.
Docusaurus leverages Markdown and MDX to let you focus on writing your content while still allowing you to easily
customize and extend your site with the power of React. By default, Docusaurus provides features for documentation sites, but
it can be used to create any kind of site and supports advanced features like versioning, i18n, and search.

CloudCannon makes it easy to store your content in your Git Repository and have non-developers update it.
Thereâ€™s no need to teach people about front matter, markdown or Git.
