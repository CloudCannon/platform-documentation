Welcome to the CloudCannon Docusaurus starter guide! If you want to get your Docusaurus Site editable, built, and live on CloudCannon, you are in the right place.

Before we start, this guide assumes you already have a Docusaurus site uploaded to a Git repository. Although you can <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/create-a-site-with-direct-upload/">upload files directly</a> from your hard drive, we highly recommend using a Git repository.

Don’t have a Docusaurus site yet? No worries! You can create one with our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/tutorials/">Jamstack tutorials for your favorite SSGs</a>.

With Docusaurus, you can use CloudCannon’s Source Editor out-of-the-box. We’ll teach you how to configure our other editing interfaces — the Content, and Data Editors — for the best editing experience.

In this guide we’ll cover how to create your first site, import snippets to use custom MDX components, and configure Docusaurus for the best CloudCannon experience.
