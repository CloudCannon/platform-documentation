On CloudCannon, navigate to the *Single Sign-On* page under *Org Settings*. We'll need details from this page later. For now, we'll just leave this page open in a tab.

On Okta, "App Integrations" are configured connections between Okta and external applications that provide a service â€” in this case, CloudCannon. Once you add CloudCannon as an App Integration, Okta will generate the XML certificate CloudCannon needs for its SAML request.

In another tab, open [Okta](https://www.okta.com/). Log in and navigate to the *Applications* page under *Applications* in the sidebar.

Click the *Create App Integration* button. Okta will open the *Create a new app integration* modal.

Select the *SAML 2.0* option under *Sign-in method* and click the *Next* button. Okta will open the *Create SAML Integration* page.

The first tab on the *Create SAML Integration* page is *General Settings*.

Enter "CloudCannon" in the *App name* text field. You also have the option to upload the [CloudCannon Logo](https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/icons/CloudCannon-Logo-Blue.svg). Adding a logo can help you find the CloudCannon app integration in your list of integrations.

Click the *Next* button. Okta will open the *Configure SAML* tab.

To set up SAML 2.0, Okta needs the following details from CloudCannon:

* The *Single sign-on URL*, which CloudCannon calls the *SSO URL*.
* The *Audience URI (SP Entity ID)*, which CloudCannon calls the *Entity ID (Issuer)*.

We can copy these details from the *Single Sign-On* page.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Org-Settings-Single-Sign-On" alt="A screenshot of the CloudCannon Single Sign-On page under Org Settings." title="The SSO page" type="screenshot"/>

The *SSO URL* on the *Single Sign-On* page should look like `https://app.cloudcannon.com/saml/xxxxx/consume`, except the `x` characters will be your CloudCannon Organization ID. Copy the *Consume URL* from CloudCannon into the *Single sign-on URL* text field on Okta. Leave the *Use this for Recipient URL and Destination URL* checkbox ticked.

The Service Provider is CloudCannon, so the Entity ID must always begin with `https://cloudcannon.com/`. If you have multiple SAML connections, you can add a suffix to the *Entity ID (Issuer)*, but for most uses you don't need one. Enter `https://cloudcannon.com/` , followed by the optional suffix, in the *Audience URI (SP Entity ID)* text field.

Finally, we need to select the *Name ID format*, which Okta will use to generate the *Name ID Format* string for CloudCannon. Select the *EmailAddress* option from the *Name ID format* dropdown in Okta.

The rest of the fields on the *Configure SAML* tab are not required for basic SSO/SAML, but you can fill them in now if you need them for your workflow.

Click the *Next* button. Okta will open the *Feedback* tab.

We don't need to add any details on the *Feedback* tab, as Okta only uses this information to improve their service rather than to set up an app integration. Click the *Finish* button. Okta will generate an XML metadata file using the information we just provided.

In the next step of this guide, we will cover downloading the XML metadata from Okta and adding it to CloudCannon.
