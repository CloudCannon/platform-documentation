In the previous step of this guide, we added CloudCannon as an app integration in Okta. Okta will use the information we provided to generate an XML metadata file with the SAML 2.0 details required by CloudCannon.

In Okta, navigate to the *Application* page for the CloudCannon app integration you just created.

Under *Metadata details* you will find the *Metadata URL*. The *Metadata URL* on the *Single Sign-On* page should look like `https://example.okta.com/app/xxxxx/sso/saml/metadata`, except `example` will be your Okta username and the `xxxxx` characters will be a unique string.

Click the *Copy* button under your *Metadata URL* and open this URL using another tab in your Internet browser.

The *Metadata URL* should show you something like this:

This information is the contents of your XML metadata file. Right click anywhere on the screen and select the *Save as...* option from your Internet browser menu. The name of this option may differ slightly from browser to browser.

Your Internet browser will open your computer's file browser, and give you the option to name you XML file before you save it. We recommend "CloudCannon-Okta-metadata.xml", or something similar, so you can easily find this file again.

Save the file to your computer.

In CloudCannon, navigate to the *Single Sign-On* page under *Org Settings*.

To set up SAML 2.0, CloudCannon needs the following details: *SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP)*, *Entity ID (Issuer)*, *Name ID Format*, *Authn Context*, *Signing Algortihm*, and *X.509 Certificate*.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If you need a reminder on these terms, check out the first page of this guide.
</comp.Notice>

CloudCannon can use the XML metadata file generated by Okta to populate the majority of these fields.

Click the *Fill form using XML Metadata* button, and select the XML metadata file we just downloaded using your computer's file browser. CloudCannon will update most of the text fields on the *Single Sign-On* page using the contents of this file.

There are two fields on the *Single Sign-On* page you may want to customize: *Initial Permission Group* and *Signing Algorithm*.

The *Initial Permission Group* dropdown lists all the [Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-permission-groups/) configured for your Organization. This field controls which Permission Group CloudCannon should add a new user to if they have not logged in to your Organization before. By default, CloudCannon uses the Editors [Default Permission Group](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/). We recommend choosing a Permission Groups with fewer permissions, and moving specific members to a different group if they require more permissions.

The *Signing Algorithm* dropdown has two options: SHA256 and SHA1. By default, CloudCannon uses the SHA256 signing algorithm to encrypt your data. We recommend using the default algorithm unless you know your workflow requires SHA1.

Scroll to the bottom of the page, and click *Add Single Sign-On*.

You have successfully configured SSO/SAML with Okta and CloudCannon!

You can share your *Login URL* with your team. To see your login page, click the *View SAML Landing Page* button. You can find your *Login URL* at the top of the *Single Sign-On* page under *Org Settings*. It should look like `https://app.cloudcannon.com/saml/xxxxx/init`, except the `x` characters will be your unique Organization ID.

Each time they attempt to log in to your Organization, CloudCannon will redirect them to your Okta landing page.
