In the last step of this guide, we added CloudCannon as an app integration in Okta. Okta will use the information we provided to generate an XML metadata file with the SAML 2.0 details required by CloudCannon.

In Okta, navigate to the *Application* page for the CloudCannon app integration you just created.

Under *Metadata details* you will find the *Metadata URL*. The *Metadata URL* on the *Single Sign-On* page should look like `https://example.okta.com/app/xxxxx/sso/saml/metadata`, except `example` will be your Okta username and the `xxxxx` characters will be a unique string.

Click the *Copy* button under your *Metadata URL* and open this URL using another tab in your Internet browser.

The *Metadata URL* should show you something like this:

This information is the contents of our XML metadata file. Right click anywhere on the screen and select the *Save as...* option from your Internet browser menu. The name of this option may differ slightly from browser to browser.

Your Internet browser will open your computer's file browser, and give you the option to name you XML file before you save it. We recommend "CloudCannon-Okta-metadata.xml", or something similar, so you can easily find this file again.

Save the file to your computer.

In CloudCannon, navigate to the *Single Sign-On* page under *Org Settings*.

Click the *Fill form using XML Metadata* button, and select the XML metadata file we just downloaded using your computer's file browser. Once you have uploaded the XML metadata file, CloudCannon will automatically populate most of the text fields on the *Single Sign-On* page using the contents of this file.

Scroll to the bottom of the page, and click *Add Single Sign-On*.

In the next step of this guide, we will cover downloading the XML certificate from Okta and adding it to CloudCannon.
