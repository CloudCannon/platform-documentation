## What is SSO/SAML?

CloudCannon supports Single Sign-On (SSO) using a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for customers on our [Enterprise plan](https://cloudcannon.com/pricing/). SSO/SAML provides a way to authenticate your team through an external application and communicate that authentication to CloudCannon.

* **User** — The team member who wants to access CloudCannon.
* **Identity Provider** — The cloud software that will authenticate the user’s identity. An Identity Provider could be an internal software or an external service, like Google. A member of your Organization already has a login for this software.
* **Service Provider** — The cloud application a user wants to log in to (i.e., CloudCannon).

With SSO/SAML, rather than logging in to CloudCannon directly, CloudCannon will authenticate the user’s identity using their Identity Provider software. While the user is logged in to their Identity Provider, they do not need to enter their CloudCannon password to log in. Instead, they can click a button, and CloudCannon will confirm their identity with their Identity Provider.
