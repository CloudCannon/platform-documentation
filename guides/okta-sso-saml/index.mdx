We know that configuring SSO/SAML can be difficult. Every provider uses different names, finding the right information

Don't worry! In this guide, we'll walk you through adding Okta SSO to your CloudCannon Organization.

Okta is...

This guide assumes that:

* You want to use Okta as your SSO Identity Provider
* You already have Okta and CloudCannon accounts.
* Your Organization is on our [Enterprise plan](https://cloudcannon.com/pricing/).
* You are a member of the Owner [Permission Group](/documentation/articles/what-are-permission-groups/) for your Organization.

## What is SSO/SAML?

CloudCannon supports Single Sign-On (SSO) using a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). SSO/SAML provides a way to authenticate your team through an external application and communicate that authentication to CloudCannon.

Before we continue, here are a few terms you should know:

* **User** — The team member who wants to access CloudCannon.
* **Identity Provider** — The software that will authenticate the user’s identity, in this case Okta. Members of your Organization must already have a login for this software.
* **Service Provider** — The application a user wants to log in to (i.e., CloudCannon).

With Okta SSO/SAML, rather than logging in to CloudCannon directly, CloudCannon will authenticate each user's identity using Okta. While they are logged in to Okta, they do not need to enter their CloudCannon password. Instead, they can click a button, and CloudCannon will confirm their identity with their Identity Provider.

## Why use SSO/SAML?

When you have a larger team, managing their access to various software can be tricky. SSO enables you to:

* Reduce the number of password resets due to forgotten passwords.
* Improve the user experience with seamless access to many applications.
* Revoke access in a single location and know you have removed access to multiple applications.

SSO is also required for some security and compliance policies, as it reduces password-related vulnerabilities and puts authentication in the hands of a single Identity Provider rather than many applications.
