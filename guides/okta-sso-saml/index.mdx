We know that configuring SSO/SAML can be difficult. Every provider uses different names and finding the right information can be confusing.

Don't worry! In this guide, we'll walk you through adding Okta SSO to your CloudCannon Organization.

[Okta](https://www.okta.com/) is a cloud-based identity and access management (IAM) service that allows you to manage how your team members access the software they need.

We recommend

Many users??

This guide assumes that:

* You want to use Okta as your SSO Identity Provider
* You already have Okta and CloudCannon accounts.
* Your Organization is on our [Enterprise plan](https://cloudcannon.com/pricing/).
* You are a member of the Owner [Permission Group](/documentation/articles/what-are-permission-groups/) for your Organization.

## What is SSO/SAML?

The acronyms SSO and SAML are often used in conjunction. Single Sign-On (SSO) refers to the process which allows a user to access multiple applications with a single set of login credentials. Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is the protocol which facilitates SSO, enabling the secure exchange of user information between the Identity Provider application and the Service Provider application.

Here are a few terms you should know:

* **User** — The team member who wants to access CloudCannon.
* **Identity Provider** — The software that authenticates the user’s identity, in this case Okta. Members of your Organization must have a login for this software.
* **Service Provider** — The application a user wants to log in to (i.e., CloudCannon).

CloudCannon supports SSO for Organizations on our Enterprise plan. With Okta SSO enabled, your team members will provide their Okta login details, rather than logging in to CloudCannon directly. Additionally, while they are logged in to Okta, your team members do not need to enter their CloudCannon password.

After configuring SSO/SAML, CloudCannon will create a custom landing page for your Organization. Team members can click a button, and CloudCannon will confirm their identity with Okta or redirect them to the Okta login page.

## How does SSO/SAML work?

## Why use SSO/SAML?

When you have a larger team, managing their access to various software can be tricky. SSO enables you to:

* Reduce the number of password resets due to forgotten passwords.
* Improve the user experience with seamless access to many applications.
* Revoke access in a single location and know you have removed access to multiple applications.

SSO is also required for some security and compliance policies, as it reduces password-related vulnerabilities and puts authentication in the hands of a single Identity Provider rather than many applications.
