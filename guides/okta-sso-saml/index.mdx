We know that configuring SSO/SAML can be difficult. Ever provider uses different names

&nbsp;

Okta is...

This guide assumes that:

* You want to use Okta as your SSO Identity Provider
* You already have Okta and CloudCannon accounts.
* Your Organization is on our [Enterprise plan](https://cloudcannon.com/pricing/).
* You are a member of the Owner [Permission Group](/documentation/articles/what-are-permission-groups/) for your Organization.

## What is SSO/SAML?

CloudCannon supports Single Sign-On (SSO) using a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). SSO/SAML provides a way to authenticate your team through an external application and communicate that authentication to CloudCannon.

Before we continue, here are a few terms you should know:

* **User** — The team member who wants to access CloudCannon.
* **Identity Provider** — The software that will authenticate the user’s identity, in this case Okta. Members of your Organization must already have a login for this software.
* **Service Provider** — The cloud application a user wants to log in to (i.e., CloudCannon).

With Okta SSO/SAML, rather than logging in to CloudCannon directly, CloudCannon will authenticate each user's identity using Okta. While they are logged in to Okta, they do not need to enter their CloudCannon password. Instead, they can click a button, and CloudCannon will confirm their identity with their Identity Provider.
