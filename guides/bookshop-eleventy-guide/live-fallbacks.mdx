Some components will never be editable without the full context of your Eleventy site. For example,
if you rely heavily on a custom plugin, or access file and network resources directly.

In these cases, you'll need to provide fallback content for Bookshop to use, or opt out of live previews
for a set of components altogether.

## Rendering different content when live editing

Bookshop sets a global flag when rendering your components in the Visual Editor. Using this flag
you can show extra information to your editors, or render fallback content instead of unsupported templating.

You can render special content in the live editing 
environment by checking the Bookshop Live Editor flag. This can be 
useful to show extra information to your editors, or to use a feature 
that isn't supported while live editing.

<comp.CodeBlock language="liquid" source="components/sample/sample.eleventy.liquid">
```
{% if env_bookshop_live %}

  <p>I am being edited live!</p>
  <h1>Fallback Title</h1>

{% else %}

  <p>Standard build output</p>
  <h1>{{ title | custom_filter }}</h1>

{% endif %}
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

With the above component, your production hosted site will contain `Standard build output` and the output
from the `custom_filter` filter. Only when inside CloudCannon's Visual Editor, where `custom_filter` does not exist,
your editors will see the `Fallback Title` branch of the template.

This approach alone will not work for custom plugins, as these must exist when the templating is parsed.
For example, the following template will fail to render:

<comp.CodeBlock language="liquid" source="components/sample/sample.eleventy.liquid">
```
{% if env_bookshop_live %}

  <p>I am being edited live!</p>
  <h1>Fallback Title</h1>

{% else %}

  <p>Standard build output</p>
  <h1>{% my_plugin %}</h1>

{% endif %}
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

To resolve this error, [define your custom plugin via your Bookshop configuration](/documentation/guides/bookshop-eleventy-guide/custom-plugins/).

<comp.CodeBlock language="javascript" source="bookshop/my-plugin.js">
```
module.exports = function (Liquid) {
    this.registerTag('my_plugin', () => {
      return true;
    });
}
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

The above snippet registers the `my_plugin` tag, which will allow the component to parse successfully.

In this example we don't add any functionality inside the plugin, so we would still wrap its usage in a `{% if env_bookshop_live %}` check.
As another option, we could instead implement a fallback inside our custom plugin file, and avoid using the `env_bookshop_live` check altogether.

## Disabling Live Editing

In some cases you can disable live editing entirely, using a flag in the component data.

This only works for components that are referenced in a site layout, and opts out of
rendering that tree of components and subcomponents. As such, this feature is intended
for rendering components such as navigation and footer templates from your Bookshop. 
In the page building workflow, you should instead use the `env_bookshop_live` template check referenced above.

To disable live editing, Bookshop will look for any of the following keys on a **top-level** component:

- live_render
- liveRender
- _live_render
- _liveRender


<comp.CodeBlock language="liquid" source="page.liquid">
```
{% bookshop 'navigation' props: props %} <!--1-->

{% bookshop 'navigation' live_render: false props: props %} <!--2-->
```
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  This component will attempt to re-render in the visual editor.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="2">
  This component will **not** re-render in the visual editor.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>
