When building your site, your Bookshop components are executed as standard Eleventy partials.
This means they have access to everything in Eleventy, including the data and collections of your site.

When Bookshop is building live previews of your components in the editor, this isn't always the case.
For example, your liquid plugins and site assets won't be available to the templating engine.

Bookshop **does** provide some access to data and collections in the visual editor, with a few caveats.
In many cases, you can continue to use both data and collections in your templating without modification.

## Pulling from collections

Accessing `collections.*` in your liquid templating works by default. All front matter from collections files
will be accessible, but some collection fields such as `content` will not be available when live editing.

One thing to note is that Bookshop is tied to [CloudCannon's collection model](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/what-is-a-collection/), not Eleventy's.
Usually these will line up if your site is properly configured for CloudCannon, but in some instances they won't.
Most notably, collections for CloudCannon (and thus Bookshop) must be segmented by folder; files spread across multiple
folders with the same `tags` key will not be available as a collection when your component is rendered in the Visual Editor.


<comp.CodeBlock language="liquid" source="components/sample/sample.eleventy.liquid">
```
{%- for post in collections.post -%}
  <h2>{{ post.data.title }}</h2> <!--1-->
  <p>{{ post.content }}</p> <!--2-->
{%- endfor -%}
```
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  Page titles and any other front-matter will be rendered.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="2">
  Page content will not be available, and will be returned empty.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>

## Pulling from data

Bookshop can pass through data from your site for live editing. This data is sourced from the CMS build,
which means it does need to be defined using [data_config in your CloudCannon configuration file](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/define-your-data/).

The following CloudCannon config will allow access to `authors.*` and `offices.*` when rendering your components
in the Visual Editor:
<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
```
data_config:
  authors: true
  offices: true
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

## Passing data into components

It's best to avoid accessing data and collections from the layout around your components,
and instead move that access into a Bookshop component or helper. If the collections or data are sourced
in your layout and passed into your component, they will not be present when live editing.

<comp.CodeBlock language="markdown" source="page.liquid">
```
---
---

{% assign posts = collections.post %}
{% bookshop 'grid' posts: posts %} <!--1-->
```
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  Bookshop will not be able to provide this collection data when live editing, as it is fetched from
  outside the Bookshop component.  
  Instead, access `collections.post` from within the `grid` component.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>
