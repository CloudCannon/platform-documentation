The `_inputs` section of your Bookshop file can be used to configure the keys in your generated structures.

This configuration is scoped to the individual component, 
so you can configure the same key differently across components â€” even 
if the components are nested within one another.

<comp.CodeBlock language="yaml" source="sample.bookshop.yml">
```
blueprint:
  text: "Hello World!"
  color: "#034AD8"
  date:
  button: bookshop:button

_inputs:
  text:
    comment: "This comment will show up in the CMS"
  color:
    type: color
  date:
    instance_value: NOW
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

<comp.CodeBlock language="yaml" source="button.bookshop.yml">
```
blueprint:
  text: "Hello World!"
  color: "#034AD8"

_inputs:
  text:
    comment: "A different comment specific to the button component"
  color:
    type: select
    options:
      values:
        - "#034AD8"
        - "#403AFC"
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Despite both components specifying `text` and `color` inputs, their input configuration is unique
and scoped to the content of each `blueprint` object.

Input configuration is passed directly to CloudCannon; see the [CloudCannon Inputs Documentation](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/how-to-choose-what-input-is-used-in-the-data-editor/) to read more.
