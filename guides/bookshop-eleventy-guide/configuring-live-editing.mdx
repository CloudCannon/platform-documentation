Bookshop can render changes to your components live in CloudCannon, allowing you to build rich visual editing experiences.

## Installing Bookshop's development dependencies

To power the live editing experience, Bookshop requires a few extra packages to be installed.
Unlike the previous plugin we installed, these dependencies have no impact on your production site,
they only provide Bookshop tooling locally on your machine and within the CloudCannon Visual Editor.

<comp.CodeBlock language="bash" source="Command line">
```
         #1
npm i -D --save-exact @bookshop/generate @bookshop/browser @bookshop/eleventy-engine
```
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  Bookshop releases all packages on every release, so the version numbers should
  always stay exactly the same. Using `--save-exact` here means that npm won't use a newer version
  than the one specified.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>

## Running the Bookshop generate command

Bookshop provides a command to run after your static site build.
This command automatically discovers your component library and your site files,
and connects CloudCannon's live editing APIs to the Bookshop components on your site.

Additionally, when we cover the structured data features of Bookshop, this command will
do the work of creating your CloudCannon Structures for you.

To run this command, add the following to a [CloudCannon postbuild script](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/extending-your-build-process-with-hooks/)
at the root of your repository:

<comp.CodeBlock language="bash" source=".cloudcannon/postbuild">
```
npx @bookshop/generate
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

With that in place, any Bookshop components that use data from the front-matter of a page should
render changes live in the Visual Editor.

Additionally, you should notice CloudCannon's Data Bindings have been added around your components,
allowing you to click directly on the page and open an editing panel.
