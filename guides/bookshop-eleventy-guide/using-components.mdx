Using a Bookshop component on your Eleventy site is very similar to using a Liquid include, with a few small differences.

## The Bookshop tag

The Bookshop plugin provides a `bookshop` tag for use in your layouts.

If you've been following along with this guide, add the following snippet
to a layout to use the sample component we created:

<comp.CodeBlock language="liquid" source="_includes/layouts/base.liquid">
```
...

{% bookshop "sample" text: "Hello from the sample component" %}

...
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

This component matches the syntax of the standard Liquid include, but takes a Bookshop component name rather than a file path.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  
</comp.Notice>
