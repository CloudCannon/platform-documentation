Visual editing on CloudCannon can be broken down into two separate parts:

1. [Previews](/documentation/articles/using-live-editing-with-react/)\: When data is changed in a data editor, the new data is sent to the page props.
This allows the editor to see the changes as they make them.
Since React does most of the work for us here, we can add a prebuilt higher-order component in a few minutes.

2. [Bindings](/documentation/articles/visual-data-bindings-with-react/)\: Tagging elements on the page tells CloudCannon where the data came from.
CloudCannon can then attach a UI to those parts directly on the page.
This frees the editor from using the Data Editor in the sidebar.

The final result is something intuitive and easy to teach.
