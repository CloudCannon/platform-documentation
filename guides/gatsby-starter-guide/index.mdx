Gatsby is a popular React-based web app framework, with a suite of tools and plugins.
Gatsby can be used as an SSG to create static sites, which can be integrated into CloudCannon with minimal setup.
CloudCannon makes it easy to store your content in your Git Repository and have non-developers update it.
Better yet, the editing is all done in context with minimal configuration.
