The second step for any new site is to get a successful build. This also mirrors your local development environment. On CloudCannon, select Gatsby as your SSG — this will set up the defaults for Gatsby.

The **Command Line Options** section is where most of the important things to configure are:

* Any required Environment Variables
* Install Command: Command to install dependencies before build. By default this runs `npm install`. This is run as a line of bash and can be anything you want. A common change here is to use `yarn install` instead.
* Build Command: Command to build your site. By default this runs `npm run build`. This is similar to the install command. An example of this build is `gatsby build`
* Output Path: Path to the output folder you are building into. This is important because CloudCannon needs to know which folder to treat as the static output of your site.

Ideally your build will work the first time. If this is the case, you can move to the next step.

You may find you need extra commands to complete your build. A common example is using postcss; for this you can use build hooks, adding specially named bash scripts that run at different steps in the build. For more information, see [the build hook documentation](/documentation/articles/extending-your-build-process-with-hooks/).

#### First-build problems
If your build did not work the first time, be sure to read the build output — this will let you know what didn't work.
CloudCannnon will read the output of your failed build and will provide suggested fixes for common problems.
Check the *Status* page to see the Build Suggestions for your site.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  CloudCannon does not support Server-side Rendering as our build and hosting environments are decoupled.

#### Interlude: Your site is built

Once your site is built, you will see a big green tick on the screen. At this point, your site’s files are synced and a successful build has been run. This means you have unlocked a newly generated preview URL. In the top left corner of the screen under your site name, there is a blue link, styled *adjective-noun.cloudvent.net*. Clicking this link will open a new tab to the hosted site on CloudCannon. It is a helpful step at this point to check that the site looks correct. If it does, you can move on to editor configuration. If you need to update your build, this can be done in your settings.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If you find the site returned a 404 on the index, you might have set the wrong output path. This can be a sign that no files were present in the configured folder.
