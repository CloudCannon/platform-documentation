    ## CloudCannon Reader

    If you're reading your build logs in CloudCannon, you'll see a build step that runs `@cloudcannon/reader` after your SSG. 

    This is the tool that scans your global configuration file and processes your collections. CloudCannon will run this tool automatically, so there isn't anything you need to do.

    If you want to look under the hood or customize your config further, Reader is open-source on GitHub at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/reader">CloudCannon/reader</a>.

    CloudCannon requires a global configuration to provide editing interfaces for Gatsby. CloudCannon gives you complete control to fine-tune the editing experience for you and your team members.
