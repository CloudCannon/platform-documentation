    Some SSGs, like Jekyll, Hugo, Astro, and Eleventy, have strong opinions about how to organize the content in your repository. CloudCannon can run automatic processes on these SSGs and provide basic editing out-of-the-box. Gatsby takes a less opinionated approach and allows you to decide where and how content is stored. This means that for Gatsby, CloudCannon’s out-of-the-box options only include the source editor.

    CloudCannon has a few concepts that make organizing data easier:

    Now that we have the terminology covered, it’s time to organize our content.

    To get the most out of CloudCannon, it's best to make sure your content is separate from your templating and routing logic. We recommend storing your page content in files using one of the file formats listed above. Markdown with front matter is a great choice for storing content because the front matter can be easily edited in the Data Editor and the Markdown content Content Editor.

    We recommend one content file per page, stored within a `content/` folder.

    With your content nicely organized, you'll then need to fetch this data into your page components. This can be done by using <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/querying-data/page-query/#add-the-graphql-query">Gatsby's GraphQL queries</a>.
