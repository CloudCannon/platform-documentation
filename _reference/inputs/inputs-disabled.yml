description: |-
  This key toggles whether the value of an Input is editable in the Data Editor or the sidebar of the Visual or Content Editor. Disabled inputs are useful if you want CloudCannon to display the Input value, but prevent team members from editing the value outside of the Source Editor.

  The value of this key can be a boolean or a string. A boolean value of `true` will prevent team members from editing the value.

  A string value can prevent team members from editing an Input based on the value of another Input. You can reverse the value with a `!` character at the beginning.

  * `published` disables an Input when the sibling Input `published` is truthy
  * `!published` disables an Input when the sibling Input `published` is falsy

  For reverse values in `YAML` files, the string should be in `'` or `"` quotation marks.

  By default, this key is `false` (i.e., team members can edit Input values).

  <comp.Example>
    In this example, we have configured the `date_created` Date Input, which will automatically populate when you create a file using this Input. Editors cannot alter this Input as the interface is disabled.

    <comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
        ``````````
        _inputs:
          date_created:
            type: datetime
            label: Date of article creation
            comment: UTC +0 timezone
            disabled: true
            instance_value: NOW
            options:
              timezone: Etc/UTC
        ``````````
        </comp.MultiCodeBlock>

    In this example, we want to disable the `edit_url` Input when the content is published.

    <comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
        ``````````
        _inputs:
          published:
            type: checkbox
            label: Published
          edit_url:
            type: url
            label: Edit URL
            disabled: published
        ``````````
        </comp.MultiCodeBlock>
