description: |-
  This key defines the minimum numerical value CloudCannon will allow in an Input. When configured, CloudCannon will prevent you from entering a lesser numerical value. If the Input already contains a lesser numerical value, CloudCannon will require you to enter a valid value to save your changes, or discard your unsaved changes.

  Value can be any integer. If `options.max` is also configured, this key cannot be a greater number.

  This key has no default.

  This key is available for Number Inputs.
