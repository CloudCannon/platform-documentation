  This key defines the maximum string length, in characters, that CloudCannon will allow in an Input. When configured, CloudCannon will warn you when an Input value is too long. If the Input already contains a longer value, CloudCannon will require you to remove characters until the Input contains a valid string to save your changes, or discard your unsaved changes.

  Value can be any non-negative integer. If this key is set to `0`, CloudCannon requires the Input to be empty. If `options.min_length` is also configured, this key cannot be a smaller number.

  This key has no default.

  This key is available for Code, Color, File, Select, Text, Rich Text, and URL Inputs. To use this key in a Select Input, `allow_create` must be set to `true`.
