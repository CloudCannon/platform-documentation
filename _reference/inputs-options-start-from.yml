description: |-
  This key defines the earliest date and time, inclusive, that CloudCannon will allow in an Input. When configured, CloudCannon will prevent you from selecting an earlier date and time. If the Input already contains an earlier date and time, CloudCannon will require you to change it to a valid value to save your changes, or discard your unsaved changes.

  Value must be in [ISO8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) format. If `options.end_before` is also configured, this key cannot be a later date and time.

  This key has no default.

  This key is available for Date and Time Inputs.
