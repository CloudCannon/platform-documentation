title: Error emails for inbox targets
---
This release added alert emails when an *Inbox* target responds with an error.

## Features & Improvements

* CloudCannon will now send an alert email when the target of your *Inbox* returns an error. These emails are sent to members of the *Developers* and *Owners* default *Permission Groups*, or *Custom Permission Groups* with the `org:settings:inbox:write` permission.
