* File Inputs now have a text field, *Clear* button, and *Select file* button at the top of the drag-and-drop area. The *Select file* button opens a dropdown with the *Upload a new file* and *Select existing file* options. When you select a file, CloudCannon will display metadata about that file if it is a document, or a preview if it is an image.
* URL Inputs
* You can now configure the `path` configuration key for URL Inputs, allowing you to control how and where CloudCannon uploads you files.
* Added the `disable_upload_file`,  `disable_direct_input`, `disable_upload_file_in_file_browser` configuration keys to File and URL Inputs, and the `hide_link_to_file` key to URL Inputs.

### Other Features & Improvements

* Updated the name of the *Preview live site here* option in the Editing Interface *Context Menu* to *Open output URL* for consistency with the *Copy output URL* option.
* Better messaging when CloudCannon cannot show a gallery image or screenshots on a File Card.
  * Red *Failed to load* text indicates that CloudCannon found an image but failed to load the image preview.
  * Gray *No preview available* indicates that CloudCannon could not find an image preview to load.
  * If you configure preview text, this will only appear in there is no icon or image, rather than while an image preview is loading.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the Context Box did not appear when configured on Boolean Inputs.
