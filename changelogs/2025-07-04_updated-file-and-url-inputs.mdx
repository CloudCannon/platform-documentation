### Other Features & Improvements

* Updated the name of the *Preview live site here* option in the Editing Interface *Context Menu* to *Open output URL* for consistency with the *Copy output URL* option.
* Better messaging when CloudCannon cannot show a gallery image or screenshots on a File Card.
  * Red *Failed to load* text indicates that CloudCannon found an image but failed to load the image preview.
  * Gray *No preview available* indicates that CloudCannon could not find an image preview to load.
  * If you configure preview text, this will only appear in there is no icon or image, rather than while an image preview is loading.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the Context Box did not appear when configured on Boolean Inputs.
