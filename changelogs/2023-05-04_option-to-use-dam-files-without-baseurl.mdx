title: Option to use DAM files without baseurl
type: minor
---
This release adds an option to set a DAM as the main asset source on a site. This means that non-fully qualified URLs will be loaded from the DAM for previews inside CloudCannon, and file paths from that DAM will be saved without the baseurl.

**Features:**

* Hosted file paths are now case-insensitive in all cases.
* Option to toggle saving the full URL when uploading or picking existing files from a DAM.&nbsp;

**Fixes:**

* Fix cases where newlines in Markdown could be stripped out unnecessarily.
* Fix the changelog dialog being overlapped by the mobile preview on the Projects page.
* Report error details when an upload to a DAM fails.
* Fix labels on snippet previews for Hugo in the Visual Editor.
* Fix image previews failing to load between uploading the image and saving.
