This release added a modal for overwriting existing files, improved the speed of large file actions, and added pnpm to preinstalled package managers.

It also addressed several issues, including those affecting base URLs, text styles and attributes, requirements for connecting GitHub repositories, and table controls in rich text inputs.

### Features & Improvements:

* Added clearer messaging and a new modal for overwriting existing files when uploading to CloudCannon.
* Improved the speed of large file operations (e.g., cloning, deleting, uploading).
* CloudCannon now has pnpm preinstalled.

### Fixes:

* Fixed an issue where snippets would ignore input configuration outside of the snippet definition.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon would repeat the base URL in URLs for Hugo sites.
* Fixed an issue where applying a style to text in a rich text editor would strip other attributes (e.g., links).
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, CloudCannon unformatted editable HTML.
* Fixed an issue causing the table controls dropdown from the WYSIWYG toolbar to be cut off by the bound of the rich text input.
* Fixed an issue causing incorrect spacing in the table controls dropdown from the WYSIWYG toolbar.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon would ignore a Hugo site’s specified environment.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, clicking “Explore existing files” in an image or file input would open a non-existent path in the file browser.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, opening a file but making no edits would appear as an unsaved change.
* Fixed an issue where preview screenshots would not work if the page URL included a special character.
* Updated the requirements for connecting CloudCannon to a GitHub repository. CloudCannon no longer requires the GitHub user who connected the GitHub app to your CloudCannon organization to have access to a repository. Now, CloudCannon only requires the user to be a member of the GitHub Organization to which the repository belongs.
* Added missing inputs in the Configuration GUI.
