title: Markdown incorrectly saved as HTML
---
This release addressed issues affecting Markdown in unconfigured *Inputs* and the *Content Editor*.

### Fixes

* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon would incorrectly save Markdown content in an unconfigured *Input* as HTML when the key name followed *Markdown Input* naming conventions (i.e., the key name was `markdown` or ended in `_markdown`).
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon would incorrectly save Markdown content edited in the *Content Editor* as HTML.
