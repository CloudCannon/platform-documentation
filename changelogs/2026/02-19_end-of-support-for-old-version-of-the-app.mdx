The old version of the CloudCannon app is no longer available. Thank you to everyone who provided feedback during this process; we have addressed all issues brought to our attention. If you have any further feedback or questions, please don't hesitate to contact our friendly [support team](/support/).

This release added several performance improvements to reduce issues for *Sites* hosted through CloudCannon. We are continuing to monitor this issue and are happy to report that the incidence has been reduced. It also added support for styles in *Text Editable Regions*.

This release addressed several issues, including those affecting the *Recent Activity* list, sorting in the *Collection Browser*, and *Snippets* in *Editable Regions*.

## Features & Improvements

* Added more improvements to address performance on *Sites* hosted through CloudCannon.
* *Text Editable Regions* where `data-type="text"` now support Rich Text styles. You can define these using `_editable.text.styles` or `_inputs.*.options.styles` for Rich Text *Inputs*.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon would incorrectly report that users "Performed an unknown action" in the *Recent Activity* list when they merged a *Pull Request*.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, sorting by date in the *Collection Browser* did not work correctly.
* Fixed an issue where *Snippets* in *Editable Regions* did not correctly load *Input* configuration.
