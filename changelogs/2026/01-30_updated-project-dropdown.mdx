title: Updated Project dropdown
---
This release updated the *Project dropdown*, improved *Context Menus* and *Tooltips*, changed the default name for new *Sites*, added more error messaging for *Component Editable Regions*, and updated the symbol for Documentation links in-app.

It also addressed several issues, including those affecting unexpectedly empty files, renamed files failing to load, the *Source Editor* and *Code Inputs*, navigating in the *Visual Editor*, and more.

### Features & Improvements

* Updated appearance and functionality of the *Project dropdown* in the *Site Header*.
* Improved functionality and keyboard accessibility for *Context Menus*.
* Improved rendering for *Tooltips*.
* When creating a new *Site*, CloudCannon no longer automatically populates the *Site Name* with the name of your Git provider Organization.
* Added an error message to *Component Editable Regions* when CloudCannon cannot find a component key.
* Improved rendering performance for *Array* and *Component Editable Regions* by allowing reuse of partial renders from parent *Editable Regions*.
* Updated the Documentation link symbol in the app from `auto_stories` to `help`.
