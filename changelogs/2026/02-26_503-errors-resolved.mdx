This release resolved all 503 errors previously affecting *Sites* hosted through CloudCannon, recategorized some of these as legitimate 414 errors, and added several improvements, including an updated in-app font, a streamlined *Getting Started with CloudCannon* guide, and better detection of Lume, Gatsby, and Nuxt when using non-standard config filenames.

It also addressed several issues, including those affecting SAML login attempts, *Snippet Cards* in *Text Editable Regions*, *Site Mounting*, file uploads, and password reset for *User Account Authentication*.

## Features & Improvements

* Resolved all 503 errors previously causing issues for *Sites* hosted through CloudCannon and recategorized some of these errors as legitimate 414 errors. Another postmortem for this issue is coming soon.
* Updated the in-app font to `system-ui` for better accessibility, performance, user experience, and maintenance.
* Streamlined the in-app *Getting Started with CloudCannon* guide after onboarding feedback.
* Updated the UI for the *Edit Collections* modal for better clarity around folder structure and suggested *Collections*.
* Removed duplicate suggestions for your *Build Configuration* (e.g., `public` and `./public/` for an *Output Path*).
* Improved detection of Lume, Gatsby, and Nuxt during *CloudCannon Configuration File* creation when the *Site* uses a non-standard config filename.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon did not clear the record of your failed login attempts after a successful SAML login.
* Fixed an issue where you could not drag *Snippet Cards* inside a *Text Editable Region*.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon did not list existing mounted *Sites* on the *Site Settings* and *Org Settings* pages.
* Fixed an issue where you could not upload a file with the same filename twice.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon would give a 500 error when you tried to reset your password for *User Account Authentication*.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, CloudCannon would treat login attempts on *Sites* with *Password Authentication* or *User Account Authentication* configured as a *Form* submission.
* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
