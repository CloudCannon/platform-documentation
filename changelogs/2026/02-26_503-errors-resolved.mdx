## Features & Improvements

* Resolved all 503 errors previously causing issues for *Sites* hosted through CloudCannon and recategorized some of these errors as legitimate 414 errors. Another postmortem for this issue is coming soon.
* Updated the in-app font to `system-ui` for better accessibility, performance, user experience, and maintenance.
* Streamlined the in-app *Getting Started with CloudCannon* guide after onboarding feedback.
* Updated the UI for the *Edit Collections* modal for better clarity around folder structure and suggested *Collections*.
* CloudCannon no longer suggests duplicate values for your *Build Configuration* (e.g., `public` and `./public/` for an *Output Path*).
* When you create your *Configuration File*, CloudCannon is better at detecting Lume, Gatsby, and Nuxt when the *Site* uses a non-standard config filename.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon did not clear the record of your failed login attempts after a successful SAML login.
* Fixed an issue where you could not drag *Snippet Cards* inside a *Text Editable Region*.
* Fixed an issue where existing mounted *Sites* did not load on the *Site Mounting* page under *Org Settings*...
* Fixed an issue where you could not upload a file with the same filename twice.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon would give a 500 error when you tried to reset your password for *User Account Authentication*.
* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
