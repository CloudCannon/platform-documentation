This release resolved all 503 errors previously affecting *Sites* hosted through CloudCannon, recategorized some of these as legitimate 414 errors, and added several improvements including an updated in-app font, a streamlined *Getting Started with CloudCannon* guide, and better detection of Lume, Gatsby, and Nuxt when using non-standard config filenames.

It also addressed several issues, including those affecting SAML login attempts, *Snippet Cards* in *Text Editable Regions*, the *Site Mounting* page, file uploads, and password reset.

## Features & Improvements

* Resolved all 503 errors previously causing issues for *Sites* hosted through CloudCannon and recategorized some of these errors as legitimate 414 errors. Another postmortem for this issue is coming soon.
* Updated the in-app font to `system-ui` for better accessibility, performance, user experience, and maintenance.
* Streamlined the in-app *Getting Started with CloudCannon* guide after onboarding feedback.
* Updated the UI for the *Edit Collections* modal for better clarity around folder structure and suggested *Collections*.
* Removed duplicate suggestions for your *Build Configuration* (e.g., `public` and `./public/` for an *Output Path*).
* Improved detection of Lume, Gatsby, and Nuxt during *CloudCannon Configuration FIle* creation when the *Site* uses a non-standard config filename.
