title: 503 Error Postmortem

Over the past week, we experienced a significant increase in bot and crawler traffic. This exposed a weakness in how our application managed database connections, leading to 503 errors for *Sites* hosted on CloudCannon. We take reliability seriously, and would like to apologize to all customers affected by this incident.

We have deployed a series of changes to address the root cause of this issue and are actively monitoring our hosting. We will confirm the effectiveness of these changes over the coming days. We are also working on broader architectural improvements to provide additional resilience under high traffic conditions. For the full incident postmortem, please see our [Status page](https://status.cloudcannon.com/incidents/rv4g09lhh0y6).

This release also addressed several issues, including those affecting new payment methods, resolving *Syncing Errors*, and custom *Testing Domains* for *Client Organizations*.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, you could not retry a payment after a failed payment.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, the *Reconnect* or *Clear and Reconnect* buttons for resolving *Syncing Errors* did not work.
* Fixed an issue preventing *Partner Organizations* from creating custom *Testing Domains* for their *Client Organizations*.
