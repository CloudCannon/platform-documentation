title: Improved UI and Better Team Pricing
type: major
---
Today we introduce a new pricing model. This creates a better agency flow with less upgrade steps and white-labelling. You can read more about it in our [pricing change announcement](https://cloudcannon.com/blog/).

CloudCannon will look very different. Everything from the login screens to the app layout has changed. Here is a complete list of the UI Changes

* User navigation has its own routes and is available in a single sidebar. This gives you access to all settings in a single place and frees up the header for contextual controls.
* Site navigations merged into a single sidebar. Labels are always visible which removes the need to remember which icon is which.
* New icons site wide from Google Material Design.
* New UI added to allow easier navigation to other pages within the visual editor.
* Uploads have a new encoding without spaces or brackets. This solves some encoding issues when outputting to a page.
* A new plans page within account settings which gives better visibility to your payment details
* Currently shared to users show up in site sharing for easy resharing
* Sharing interface tidied to allow faster updates to existing shares
* Background images added to login and sidebar header
* Better mobile styles in all sections of the app
* Markdown editor handles files starting with an hr or an empty yaml header
* Font changed from Roboto to Open Sans
* General bug fixes
