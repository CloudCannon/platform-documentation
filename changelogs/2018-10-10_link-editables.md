title: Link Editables
type: minor
---

This release adds a new editable element, specifically for anchor tags. The editable is consistent with the link edit interface inside text and block editable elements, but is a standalone version where the element can't be accidentally removed. A number of general fixes are also included.

**Features:**

* Link editable elements
* Sites under projects are now displayed in a list

**Fixes:**

* Preview URL now shows correctly in sites list
* File counts in Dashboard corrected for filtered out files
* Various styling issues
* Remove experimental build server message (now irrelevant)
* Fix some developer-only fields appearing in collection metadata edit modal
* Posts and Drafts now retain folder structure through create and publish flow
* Classes on `span` elements are now retained as HTML if saved back into Markdown files
