This release adds a new section for your custom domains. This is the new location for updating DNS. Adding a domain to a site remains the same. We've also updated the data editing interfaces to make navigating between objects more user friendly.

**Features:**

* New domains list
* New look for the content editor
* New look for data editing interfaces

**Fixes:**

* Brand colour picker not visible
* Rich text editor link issues
