This release improved the number of relevant results shown by DAM browsers for Google and Cloudinary DAMs.

It also addressed an issue affecting the button to update a Site from its Publish Branch.

## Features & Improvements

* Google and Cloudinary DAMs will now show more relevant results when using the DAM browser from an input (e.g., opening the DAM browser from an image input will show image filetypes).

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the button to pull changes from the Publish Branch was sometimes incorrectly disabled.
