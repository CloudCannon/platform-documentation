title: Domain fixes
type: minor
---
This release fixes a couple of bugs that occurred after removing domain names from sites. Also included are additional bug fixes.

**Fixes:**

* Fixed an issue where deleting your domain would not remove the hostname from Cloudflare
* Removing a domain from a site now properly purges the cached files on that domain
* Fixed a bug caused by reordering large arrays of images
* Encoding workaround for collection key with slashes
