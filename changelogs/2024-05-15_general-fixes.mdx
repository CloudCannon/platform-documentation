This release made minor improvements to the UI in the invitation workflow.

It also addressed several issues affecting copy in the app, UI elements not appearing correctly, cloned files, and permissions.

## Features & Improvements

* The *Add members* button is now disabled when one or both fields on the *Invite team members to your Organization* modal are empty.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the *Delete Organization* page in *Org Settings* disappeared after you downgraded your CloudCannon pricing plan.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon attempted to load a list of available inboxes on the *Forms* page for team members without the `org:settings:inbox:read` permission.
* Fixed an incorrect heading on the *Assets* page under *Org Settings.*
* Fixed an issue where saving a cloned file after editing and saving the original copy of the file would cause a syncing error.
* Fixed an issue where the *Context menu* did not appear for Group cards on the *Team Member* page.
* Fixed an issue where two tabs on the *Organization List* page would appear selected simultaneously.
