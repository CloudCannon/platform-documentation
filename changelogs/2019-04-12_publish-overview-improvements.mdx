title: Publish Overview Improvements
type: minor
---

This release brings a number of features and fixes, including improvements to the *Publish* section. Changes directly from Git are now displayed instead of the relevant CloudCannon activity for that site, giving a more accurate overview of the merge.

**Features:**

* Improved *Publish* overview displaying provider-specific information
* Drag-to-reorder support for multiselect inputs
* Helper text for new projects
* New HTML draft posts with `date` in front matter now initially set to today's date to prevent unintentional build errors

**Fixes:**

* Opening a publish request in *Client Sharing* no longer erroneously allows read access to some developer portions of the app
* Files with `txt` extension no longer appear in *Explore*
* "Create new file" no longer appears in recently opened files
* Uploading a `jpeg` file with a specific configuration no longer breaks extension
* Content in *Collection Defaults* files now correctly populated for new files
* Many more Markdown-specific special characters supported in editor without breaking content
* Various issues with creating and opening HTML posts, drafts and collection items from *Explore* fixed
