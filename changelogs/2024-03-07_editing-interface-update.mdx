## New CloudCannon editing interface!

The new CloudCannon editing interface is now the default for all your sites.

Thank you to everyone who assisted in our most successful Beta yet. Your feedback has been helpful, and all known issues have been addressed.

The Legacy editing interface is still available for a short amount of time. CloudCannon will provide support for the Legacy editing interface until March 29th, 2024. If you have any feedback about this change, please get in touch with our support team.

## Our new editing experience

Editing in CloudCannon is now a collaborative experience where multiple users can create content together. We’ve improved how our editing interfaces look and function. We’ve also introduced avatars to various places within the app so you can see who is editing what in real time.
