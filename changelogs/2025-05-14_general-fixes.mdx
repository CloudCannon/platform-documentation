This release added better error messaging for Custom Domain creation.

It also addressed several issues, including those affecting `file_config`, the *Rebuild* button, Schemas in the Visual Editor, and DAMs.

## Features & Improvements

* Better error messaging when creating a Custom Domain fails.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon displayed Collections incorrectly if you configured a `file_config` entry with a null `glob`.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, the *Custom Domain* page under *Site Settings* would incorrectly display the Testing Domain.
* Fixed an issue where the *Rebuild* button on the *Status* page did not work.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon did not apply a Schema to new files in the Visual Editor.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon would ignore the *Use Relative Paths* settings for DAMs.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, your DAM would not open correctly when you selected *Explore existing assets* in a File input.
