This release added better error messaging for Custom Domain creation.

It also addressed several issues, including those affecting `file_config`, the *Rebuild* button, Schemas in the Visual Editor, and DAMs.

## Features & Improvements

* &nbsp;Better error messaging when creating a Custom Domain fails.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where you could configure `file_config.glob` with no value, causing CloudCannon to display Collections incorrectly.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, the *Custom Domain* page under *Site Settings* would incorrectly display the Testing Domain.
* Fixed an issue where the *Rebuild* button on the *Status* page did not work.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon did not apply a Schema to new files in the Visual Editor.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon would ignore `use_relative_paths` for DAMs.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, your DAM would not open correctly when you selected *Explore existing assets* in a File input.
