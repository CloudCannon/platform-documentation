This release improved accessibility in the CloudCannon app by updating the shade of red used in the terminal and adding keyboard accessibility for various buttons. The CloudCannon UI now updates for all users when a user edits the organization branding, site details, or flags.

It also addressed incorrect copy in the upstream changes tooltip, extra prefixes preventing filename clash detection when uploading to a DAM, issues with structure configuration, and patched security vulnerabilities.

### Features & Improvements:

* Updated the shade of red used in the CloudCannon terminal to pass Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) criteria at AAA level.
* Improved keyboard accessibility for various buttons in the app.
* CloudCannon now updates the site UI for all users when a user change the organization branding, site details, or site flags (i.e., *Editing locked* or Beta *Editing sessions* flag).

### Fixes:

* Fixed the tooltip copy regarding [upstream changes](/documentation/articles/update-from-a-publish-branch/) on the *Publish* button in your *Site navigation*.
* CloudCannon now respects extra prefixes when checking for clashing filenames while uploading to a DAM.
* Fixed an issue where, when adding an item to an array or object input, CloudCannon would select the first matching structure rather than the best match.
* When configuring structures, the `preview.text` and `preview.icon` keys now fall back to `label` and `icon`.
* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
