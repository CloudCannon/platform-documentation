This release adds support for paying with 3D Secure credit cards.

**Features:**

* Added a button on the login screen to go back after selecting "Log in with email".

**Fixes:**

* Output files starting with underscores can now be selected when linking to another page.
* The "Close" button on pull requests is now red to make it clearer that it will remove the pull request.
* Inputs can now respect instance values configured on a schema.
* Keys in nested schemas are now correctly sorted and deleted according to the `reorder_inputs` and `remove_extra_inputs` options.
* Fixed a bug preventing existing images from being added to a page on sites with a Jekyll `base_url`.
* A confirmation step is now required before files in Azure DAMs can be overwritten by a new upload.
* Patched potential security vulnerabilities.
