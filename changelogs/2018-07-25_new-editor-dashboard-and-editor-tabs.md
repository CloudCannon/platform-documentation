title: New editor dashboard and editor tabs
type: major
---

This release is further work on our UX improvements. We have renamed the recently released developer dashboard to status (This will look familiar to our long time users). Doing this allowed us to use the dashboard icon and name for the editor workflows. The Dashboard is designed to give an overview on your site and will be extended over the next few months with more options.

The second large feature is editor tabs. When navigating the different editing interfaces in your site, tabs will become available. This is designed to enable better context switching and increase prevent navigation traps. We want to prevent the need for multiple browser tabs when using CloudCannon.

**Features:**

* Editor tabs
* Editor Dashboard
* Custom collection icons
* Scheduled builds can be set to 1 hour

**Fixes:**

* User images are circular and main focus in activity
* Spacing on sign up page recaptcha
