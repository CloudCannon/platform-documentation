This release includes a variety of fixes across the app.

**Fixes:**

* Fixed Hugo files sometimes not using the correct layout in the Visual Editor.
* Fixed the breadcrumbs in the asset browser when using a DAM with a configured folder.
* Fixed a bug causing some contextual menus being obscured by other UI.
* Files will now upload into the DAM folder you have navigated to in CloudCannon, instead of always going to the root.
* Fixed a bug where the automatic config migration from Forestry failed silently when processing templates with a `.yaml` extension.
* Fixed the `choice`&nbsp;input sometimes behaving strangely.
* Hide notifications about build/sync status when you are on a page that already shows that information.
* Prevent duplicate notifications.
* Added a little more feedback on the DAM configuration screen to make it clearer when changes are saved.
