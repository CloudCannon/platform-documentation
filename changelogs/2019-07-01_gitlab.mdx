This release introduces GitLab as a storage provider. Support is currently for GitLab.com only, not self hosted solutions. Similar to our other Git-based storage providers, you can sync your source and/or output with GitLab repositories, sign in with GitLab, and manage publishing with merges or merge requests.

**Features:**

* GitLab.com support
* Optional transparency slider for colour inputs with suffixes ending with "a"

**Fixes:**

* Fixed some special characters in usernames from breaking FTP output connection
* Better build logging
* Prevented in-file `_comments` keys that correspond to select values from being cleared on save
