This release adds integration with [GitHub Enterprise Server](/documentation/articles/connecting-a-github-enterprise-server-repository-as-your-source/) as a Git Provider.

**Features:**

* Added support for [GitHub Enterprise Server](/documentation/articles/connecting-a-github-enterprise-server-repository-as-your-source/)

**Fixes:**

* Addressed issue with the last release [not triggering initial builds for new sites](https://status.cloudcannon.com/incidents/3nsxtwz35b10)
* Fixed issue with conflicting `height` option for rich text inputs. `initial_height` is now used as the option to [set the initial height of the input](/documentation/articles/rich-text-inputs/#initial_height)
