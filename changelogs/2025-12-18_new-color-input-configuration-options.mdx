title: New Color Input configuration options
---
This release added the `palette` and `hide_picker` configuration keys for *Color Inputs*, improved filter behavior for straight and curly quote marks, changed how CloudCannon determines developer files, added better warning and error messaging, and improved overall app performance.

It also addressed several issues, including those affecting SSG suggestions, *File Card* icons in the *Collection Browser*, endless loading states after a failed Sync, and `.yml` and `.json` Schema files.

## Features & Improvements

* You can now configure the `palette` option for *Color Inputs*. This key provides a palette below the color picker for important color values.
* You can now configure the `hide_picker` option for *Color Inputs* with the `palette` option configured. This key toggles whether CloudCannon displays the color spectrum picker and the palette. When set to `true`, the *Color Input* will only display the palette.

* When using a filter to search files or *Sites* in one of CloudCannon's *Browsers*, the filter will now return results for straight quotation marks ( `'` or `"` ) and curly quotation marks ( `’` or `”`) whenever a string contains either type of quote character.
* CloudCannon no longer automatically treats files in a folder called `components` as developer files.
* Added a warning message to the *Site Navigation* when your *Site* uses features that require the new version of CloudCannon.
* Better error messaging when a Component *Editable Region* cannot detect any registered components.
* Improved overall app performance.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where files with the `+` character in the filename would not open in CloudCannon *Editing Interfaces*.
* Fixed an issue where, when creating your *CloudCannon Configuration File*, CloudCannon would incorrectly suggest Hugo as your SSG.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, editing your *Collection* configuration would incorrectly change the file icons in the *Collection Browser* to `notes`.
* Fixed an issue where, for non-unified *Sites* or *Sites* without live configuration, updating the title of a new file did not update the title displayed on the *File Card* or in the *Editing Interface Header*.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon could enter an endless loading state after a failed Sync.
* Fixed an issue causing the *Site Icon*, and icons, images, and gallery images on *File Cards* to have incorrect rounding.
* Fixed an issue where, when editing the content of an *HTML Input*, CloudCannon would incorrectly update the value for the `loading` attribute on images.
* Fixed an issue causing the *Content Editor* to lag when a file contained many Snippets.
* Fixed an issue where you could not clear the value of a *Date Input*.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon did not parse `.yml` or `.json` Schema files correctly.
