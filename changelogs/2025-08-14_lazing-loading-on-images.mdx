title: Lazing loading on images
---
This release added support for lazing loading on images, `.jsx` syntax highlighting, icons in Text inputs, and telephone links in URL inputs.

It also addressed an issue causing an indefinite loading state.

## Features & Improvements

* Added the *Lazy loading* checkbox to the *Edit image* data panel, which adds the `loading="lazy"` attribute to images.
* Added support for `.jsx` file syntax highlighting in the Code Editor.
* Added the `icon`, `icon_color,` and `icon_background_color` configuration keys to Text inputs.
* Added the `show_link_to_telephone` configuration option to URL inputs. When used, CloudCannon will prepend the value of the URL input with `tel:`.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where incorrect `_snippets_imports` configuration would cause CloudCannon to be stuck in a loading state.
* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
