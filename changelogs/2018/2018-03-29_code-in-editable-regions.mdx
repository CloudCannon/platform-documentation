This release provides an option to enable the code button in the *Content Editor*, *Editable Regions* and *Rich Text* front matter fields. The button toggles inline code if text is selected, or a code block otherwise.

**Features:**

* Code option for editor toolbars

**Fixes:**

* Lists inside tables within Markdown files are now output correctly on save
* Parsing inconsistency with code blocks within lists on some Kramdown versions
