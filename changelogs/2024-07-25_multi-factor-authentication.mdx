title: Multi-factor authentication
---
This release added [multi-factor authentication](/documentation/articles/what-is-multi-factor-authentication/) for all CloudCannon accounts.

It also addressed several issues, including those affecting the *GitHub OAuth* button, resending form messages, rendering Pull Requests, uploading to DAMs, and creating new sites from a template.

## Features & Improvements

* Added the option to use multi-factor authentication on all CloudCannon accounts through a third-party authentication app.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, clicking the *GitHub OAuth* button on the *Account Settings* page would result in a 500 error.
* Fixed an issue where the *Resend Message* option on the *Form submissions* page did not work.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, CloudCannon would not render a Pull Request after clicking the *Create Pull Request* button.
* Fixed an issue where uploading assets to a large DAM would sometimes cause CloudCannon to crash.
* Fixed an issue where, for S3 DAMs, CloudCannon did not display recently uploaded assets in the DAM browser.
* Fixed an issue preventing you from creating a new site from a template.
