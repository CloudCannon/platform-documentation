Our Beta is now available to everyone!

The Publishing Conflict Resolution Beta introduces Publishing Conflict resolution in app, appearance and functionality improvements to the *Publishing* page, *Status* page, and *Domains* section, an updated *Source Editor*, and text diffs for unsaved changes in our editing interfaces.
