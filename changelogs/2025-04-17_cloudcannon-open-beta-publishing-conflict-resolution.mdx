This release improved our file server performance and reliability, added the *Use Relative URLs when redirecting* flag, comments for DNS records, and NS DNS records for subdomains.

It also addressed issues affecting the Snippets tool in the Rich Text *WYSIWYG toolbar*, and accepting transfers.

## Features & Improvements

* Improved file server performance and reliability for better hosting.
* Added the *Use Relative URLs when redirecting* flag under *Org Settings* and *Site Settings* to use relative redirects rather than absolute redirects.
* You can now add a comment to DNS records, allowing you to write a reminder description of the record's purpose.
* You can now add an NS record for your Custom Domain subdomains.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon would incorrectly include or exclude the Snippets tool from the Rich Text *WYSIWYG toolbar*.
* Fixed an issue where, when accepting a transfer to your Organization, CloudCannon would incorrectly show an error when the transfer had succeeded.
