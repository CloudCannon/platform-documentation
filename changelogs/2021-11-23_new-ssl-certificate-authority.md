title: New SSL certificate authority
type: minor

This release changes the SSL certificate authority used on origin hosting.

Automatic origin certs are now generating using [ZeroSSL](https://zerossl.com/). Existing certs will change-over ten days before they expire. We've also made some minor visual changes to inputs, and included a fix for an issue with attaching SSL certificates.

**Features:**

* Bolder input labels
* Data editor comments are easier to read, and are now displayed underneath input labels
* Better date/time inputs on mobile
* Added support for mermaid code blocks

**Fixes:**

* Fixed an issue with attaching custom SSL certificates to sites
