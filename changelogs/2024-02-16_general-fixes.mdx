This release addressed issues affecting preview screenshots and patched security vulnerabilities.

### Fixes:

* CloudCannon has updated how we store preview screenshots for your sites.
  * Users may notice that preview screenshots for cards in the app are temporarily unavailable. Screenshots will appear again after the site is rebuilt.
* Fixed an issue where preview screenshots would fail for pages with no trailing slash or an extensionless URL.
* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
