This release addressed several issues, including those affecting Client Sharing login, MFA and Organization-level Flag permissions, and form reCAPTCHA.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where, after a visitor submitted a file attachment through a from, Clients were unable to log in to CloudCannon using their Site password when following the link from the alert email.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, users with the `org:settings:details:write` permission could edit the Multi-Factor Authentication and Oragnization-level Flags. You must be a member of the Owners Permission Group to edit these settings.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, reCAPTCHA validation would pass incorrectly. CloudCannon will now forward form submissions that fail reCAPTCHA validation to the *Error* section of your *Inbox*.
