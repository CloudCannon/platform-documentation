title: Collection fixes
type: minor
---
This release fixes issues relating to collection configuration. The options and default behavior for commit templates has also been updated.

On Tuesday 7 March 3pm NZT (2am UTC), changes from the CloudCannon Beta will be released to all users. There will be an option to "Enter CloudCannon Legacy" next to your personal settings if you need to go back for any reason.

**Features:**

* Added a new commit template placeholder to match the existing default commit message. Non-data placeholders can use any filters.

**Fixes:**

* Site files can no longer be assigned to multiple collections at once
* Fixed a bug where collections configured at specific paths were ignored in Jekyll sites.
