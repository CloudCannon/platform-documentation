title: Domains and paste from Microsoft Word
type: minor
---

This release updates our domains interfaces with name server comparison. We've also improved how pasting content from external sources works, including from Microsoft Word.

**Features:**

* Domain name servers comparisons
* Domain name navigation updated
* Rich text paste from external sources
* Adding a link to an email address auto-populates the link
* Table `thead` element and `th` scope attribute support
* Address field added to *Account Settings* for invoices

**Fixes:**

* Select and multiselect option drop downs not longer cut off inside modal
* Adding a new collection item inside a subfolder now uses the correct *Collection Defaults* file
