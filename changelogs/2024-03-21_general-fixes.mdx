This release addressed issues affecting `_unlisted` collection items, tables and lists in editable regions, UI spacing, preview URLs, Hugo CLI commands, and error messaging for array inputs.

### Fixes:

* Fixed an issue where `_unlisted` collection items would sometimes appear as a blank box in a multi-select input.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon would strip attributes from tables and lists in editable regions.
* Fixed an issue affecting UI spacing in the site list.
* Fixed an issue where the client sharing link incorrectly prepended the preview URL.
* Better handling of preview URLs with no specified protocol.
* Updated the flag names for `--printI18nWarnings`, `--printMemoryUsage`, and `--printPathWarnings` to match Hugo 0.93.0.
* Added the missing Hugo CLI flag `--printUnusedTemplates`.
* Better error messaging for misconfigured array inputs.
