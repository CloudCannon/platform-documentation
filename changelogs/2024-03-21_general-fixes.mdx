This release addressed issues affecting `_unlisted` collection items, Hugo CLI commands, error messaging for array inputs, and tables in editable regions.

### Fixes:

* Fixed an issue where \_unlisted collection items would sometimes appear as a blank box in a multi-select input.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon would strip attributes from tables and lists in editable regions.
* Updated the flag names for `--printI18nWarnings`, `--printMemoryUsage`, and `--printPathWarnings` to match Hugo 0.93.0.
* Added the missing Hugo CLI flag `--printUnusedTemplates`.
* Better error messaging for misconfigured array inputs.
