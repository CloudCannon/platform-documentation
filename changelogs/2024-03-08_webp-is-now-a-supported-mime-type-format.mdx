type: minor
---
This release added support for WebP as a MIME-type format and a flag allowing Clients to use the Legacy Editor.

It also addressed several issues affecting image previews, Snippets, site backups, and the Legacy Editor.

### Features & Improvements:

* CloudCannon now supports WebP as a MIME type format.
* Added a site flag to allow Clients to use the Legacy Editor.

### Fixes:

* Fixed an issue where, when an image URL contained a fragment, the image preview would not load.
* Fixed an issue where tabbing to the drag indicator on a Snippet and pressing enter would replace the Snippet with a new line.
* Fixed an issue where the Snippet controls would not appear if the Snippet was the first element in a file.
* Fixed an issue where open editing sessions with no unsaved changes would prevent Legacy Editor users from making changes.
* Fixed an issue where site backups would always include the .git folder, even when explicitly excluded.
* Additional error handling was added to prevent an issue where the&nbsp;*Update status*&nbsp;indicator would continuously loop.
* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
