This release includes a variety of fixes and improvements across the app.

**Features:**

* Lists of site files now give a more obvious indication when items have been filtered out.
* You can now select from your existing Cloudinary upload\_presets in the site level DAM settings.

**Fixes:**

* Site level sharing permissions will now be removed for a user who is given organization level permissions, to prevent confusion and doubled billing.
* Fixed oversized icons in dropdowns on Safari.
* Site collaborators can now use and upload DAMs connected to those sites.
* Fixed an issue where the confirmation prompt would be bypassed when uploading a clashing file at a subpath in a DAM.
* Fixed an error when uploading files to Azure without a container set in the&nbsp; organization level DAM configuration.
