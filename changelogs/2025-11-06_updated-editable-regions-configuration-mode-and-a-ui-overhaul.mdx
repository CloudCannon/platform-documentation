## Features & Improvements

### Updated *Editable Regions*

This release updates our existing *Editable Regions* feature to improve visual editing configuration. With updated *Editable Regions*, you can add HTML attributes or web components to any file that produces an HTML webpage at build time. You can visually edit content in layout files (e.g. `.astro`, `.tsx`, etc), structured data in your front matter, and Markup content inline on a preview of your webpage.

You do not need to change your file structure or data format, and can migrate at your own pace by starting with key fields and gradually adding more. Additionally, this update introduces no breaking changes, so previously configured methods of visual editing will not be affected. Updated *Editable Regions* work with all SSGs.

* Added six new types of *Editable Region*: Text, Image, Source, Array, Array Item, and Component.
  * For example, you can define a Text *Editable Region* with the HTML attribute `data-editable="text"` or the web component `<editable-text>`.
  * Tell CloudCannon where your data is stored using the `data-prop` or `data-path` HTML attribute.
* You can now edit text values inline, update image details, add, remove, or reorder array items, and re-render changes to components in the Visual Editor.
* &nbsp;CloudCannon will re-render any changes you make using the data panel, sidebar, or inline in the Visual Editor, keeping the preview of your webpage accurate.
* Each *Editable Region* requires different HTML attributes, so we highly recommend reading our new [Set up Visual Editing](/documentation/guides/set-up-visual-editing/) guide.

For more information, please read our documentation on [Visual Editing](/documentation/articles/what-is-visual-editing/) in general, or see our [Editable Regions](/documentation/articles/editable-regions-reference/) reference documentation for a complete list of configuration options.

### Configuration Mode

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p><em>Configuration Mode</em> is only available on <em>Sites</em> using Unified Configuration. For more information, please read our <a href="/documentation/guides/unified-configuration-migration-guide/">Migrate to Unified Configuration</a> guide.</p>
</comp.Notice>

We have added a new tool to your *Sites* on CloudCannon: [Configuration Mode](/documentation/articles/what-is-configuration-mode/). You can find the *Configuration Mode* switch in the top right of your *Site* (in your new *Site Header*). Turning *Configuration Mode* on reveals purple *Edit Configuration* buttons across your *Site*.
