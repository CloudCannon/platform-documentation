## Features & Improvements

### Updated *Editable Regions*

This release updates our existing *Editable Regions* feature to improve visual editing configuration. With updated *Editable Regions*, you can add HTML attributes or web components to any file that produces an HTML webpage at build time. You can visually edit data stored in HTML within layout files (e.g., `.astro`, `.liquid`, `.tsx`, etc), structured data in front matter or data files, and Markdown content, all inline on a preview of your webpage.

You do not need to change your file structure or data format, and can migrate at your own pace by starting with key fields and gradually adding more. Additionally, this update introduces no breaking changes, so previously configured methods of visual editing will not be affected. Updated *Editable Regions* work with all SSGs.

* Added six new types of *Editable Region*: Text, Image, Source, Array, Array Item, and Component.
  * For example, you can define a Text *Editable Region* with the HTML attribute `data-editable="text"` or the web component `<editable-text>`.
  * Tell CloudCannon where your data is stored using the `data-prop` or `data-path` HTML attribute.
* You can now edit text values inline, update image details, add, remove, or reorder array items, and re-render changes to components in the Visual Editor.
* &nbsp;CloudCannon will re-render any changes you make using the data panel, sidebar, or inline in the Visual Editor, keeping the preview of your webpage accurate.
* Each *Editable Region* requires different HTML attributes, so we highly recommend reading our new [Set up Visual Editing](/documentation/guides/set-up-visual-editing/) guide.

For more information, please read our documentation on [Visual Editing](/documentation/articles/what-is-visual-editing/) in general, or see our [Editable Regions](/documentation/articles/editable-regions-reference/) reference documentation for a complete list of configuration options.

### Configuration Mode

We have added a new tool to your *Sites* on CloudCannon: [Configuration Mode](/documentation/articles/what-is-configuration-mode/). *Configuration Mode* is only available on *Sites* using Unified Configuration. For more information, please read our [Migrate to Unified Configuration](/documentation/guides/unified-configuration-migration-guide/) guide.

* You can find the *Configuration Mode* switch in the top right of your *Site* (in your new *Site Header*). Turning *Configuration Mode* on reveals purple *Edit Configuration* buttons across your *Site*.
* Each *Edit Configuration* button opens a data panel for specific fields in your  *CloudCannon Configuration File*, allowing you to see your configuration changes live and in context.
* *Configuration Mode* allows you to update your *Site Navigation* by defining *Collections*, the configuration for each *Collection*, your Inputs at each level of the configuration cascade, add actions to your *Dashboard*, and more.
* To support the functionality of these data panels, we have added input validation to your *CloudCannon Configuration File*.
* This tool replaces the *Edit your configuration file* button on the *Editing* page under *Site Settings*. However, you can still open your *CloudCannon Configuration File* in the Data Editor through your *File Browser*.
* You can turn *Configuration Mode* off at any time to hide all *Edit Configuration* buttons.

For more information, please read our new [Getting Started with CloudCannon](/documentation/guides/getting-started-with-cloudcannon/) guide or our documentation on [Configuration Mode](/documentation/articles/what-is-configuration-mode/) in general.

### *Site Navigation* updates and new *Site Header*

<comp.DocsImage path="" alt="" title="" type="screenshot"/>

* Added the new *Site Header* UI, freeing up room in your *Site Navigation* for more *Collections*.
  * Moved the *Site* name, icon, project, and branch information from the *Site Navigation* to the left of the *Site Header*.
  * Moved the *Avatar* list, *Open URL*, and *Save* button to the right of the *Site Header*. The location of the *Save* button is now consistent between the *Site Dashboard* and any editing interface.
* The *Publishing* button is now a link, making it consistent with other UI elements that open pages rather than perform actions or open modals.
* Removed the numbers from the *Publishing changes* indicator, instead showing a downwards arrow for available updates and an upwards arrow for unpublished changes.
* The *Developer* section is now pinned to the bottom of your *Site Navigation* and collapsible.

### *Site Dashboard* updates

* Removed the *Status* page to reduce information redundancy with the *Site Dashboard* and address user confusion about where to find information.
  * Moved the *Syncs*, *Builds*, and *Build Deploys* tabs from the old *Status* page to your *Site Dashboard*.
  * Replaced the *Suggestions* and *Recommendations* sections of the *Status* page and other onboarding information with new in-app guides on the *Guides* tab of the *Site Dashboard*.
* The *Status* indicator icon is now next to the *Dashboard* link in your *Site Navigation* and the *Summary* tab on your *Dashboard*.
* Updated the *Summary* tab of your *Site Dashboard*.
  * Added the *Active Guide* section to the left column.
  * Added a *Sync* and *Build* preview section to the right column, which displays the status of your most recent sync, build, and compress. You can trigger a sync or build using the *Pull* or *Rebuild* buttons.
  * Added a *Usage* section to the right column, which displays the bandwidth and build time used this month.
  * Moved the *Actions* section to the right column.
  * Moved the *Recent Activity* section to the left column and improved the UI to resemble a timeline better. The *Recent Activity* section on the *Summary* tab now only displays the three most recent events.
  * Removed the *Live URL* text field.
  * Removed the Laptop and Phone Home page preview.
* Minor UI updates to the *Activity* tab to resemble a timeline better.
* Added the *Usage* tab to your *Site Dashboard*.
  * You can now see a graph of bandwidth and build time usage for your *Site*.
  * Added a table showing bandwidth usage per URL on your *Site*, including the number of requests.&nbsp;
* Moved the *Recently Opened* section from the *Site Dashboard* to the *Open Recent* option in the Editing Interface *Context Menu.*
* New *Dashboard* icon in the *Site Navigation*.

### New in-app *Guides*

* Added a *Guides* tab to your *Site Dashboard*.
* In-app guides are designed to assist you in configuring different CloudCannon features. Currently, there are three in-app guides: *Getting Started with Editing*, *Set up Visual Editing*, and *Host your website on the Internet*.
  * The *Getting Started with Editing* guide will start automatically when you create a new *Site*. However, branching from a *Site* that has already completed a guide will not restart it.
* When you select an active guide on the *Guides* tab, CloudCannon will display the next steps to complete on your *Dashboard* *Summary* tab.
* Each in-app guide will also have a counterpart on the [CloudCannon Documentation](/documentation/guides/) website, providing more context, best practices, and helping you troubleshoot any issues.
* You can turn off the active guide prompt on your *Summary* tab at any time using the *Disable Guides* button on the *Guides* tab.
* In-app guides focused on your *Organization* will also appear on the new *Organization Home* page.
