## Features & Improvements

### Updated *Editable Regions*

This release updates our existing *Editable Regions* feature to improve visual editing configuration. With updated *Editable Regions*, you can add HTML attributes or web components to any file that produces an HTML webpage at build time. You can visually edit content in HTML-like layouts (e.g. `.astro`, `.tsx`, etc), structured data in your front matter, and Markup content inline on a preview of your webpage.

You do not need to change your file structure or data format, and can migrate at your own pace by starting with key fields and gradually adding more. Additionally, this update introduces no breaking changes, so previously configured methods of visual editing will not be affected.
