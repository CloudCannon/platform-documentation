title: 'CloudCannon Beta: Publishing Conflict Resolution'
---
Our new beta is now available to CloudCannon [Partners](/partner-program/)!

The March 2025 Publishing Conflict Resolution Beta introduces basic conflict resolution in app, appearance and functionality improvements to the *Publishing* page and *Domains* section, and an updated *Source Editor*.

We’d like to invite our Partners to test our new features before the full launch. Taking part in this Beta is a great chance to let us know what’s working, and what could be improved for you and your team.

For a full description of our Beta features, check out our [Beta Changelog](/documentation/articles/beta-changelog/).
