This release untangles several issues with site screenshots in the device view, as seen in the Home Dashboard and Projects list. Rebuilding your site will now correctly display the screenshot of your site.

We've also included a fix for some malformed Cloudinary URLs.

**Fixes:**

* Fixed several issues with the site screenshot service
* Fixed a bug causing Cloudinary asset URLs to be added incorrectly in the Data Editor
