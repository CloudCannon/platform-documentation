* Better loading and error states for the Visual Editor
* Wording on some buttons is now more semantically correct
* Publishing with 'merge and delete' will now redirect you to the project upon completion
* Consolidated the edit and create routes for files

**Fixes:**

* Fixed an issue where the site Inbox failed to load in the client sharing interface
* Fixed some performance issues when displaying large numbers of items
* A single collaborator on multiple sites will now correctly show as one share in an organisation's team settings
* Fixed a bug causing site navigation to sometimes be hidden on new sites
