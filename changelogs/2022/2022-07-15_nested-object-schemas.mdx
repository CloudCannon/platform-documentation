This release adds support for nested objects within your collections schemas. We've also added support for Pipenv on the build server, and released a variety of bug fixes.

Earlier we released a set of major improvements to the CloudCannon Editors on open beta. You can read all about the changes in our [Editor improvements blog post](https://cloudcannon.com/blog/saving-time-our-new-editor-improvements/).

**Features:**

* [Collection schemas](/documentation/developer-articles/create-a-schema/) now support nested objects
* Installed [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) on the build server

**Fixes:**

* Fixed an SSO issue with Microsoft Azure
* Fixed a copy issue on the SSO settings page
* Using the `enableGitInfo` Hugo build option will no longer break the build
* Fixed a link to the documentation not opening in a new tab
* Fixed Gemfile autodetection in a site's vendor folder
