This release allows users to upload files using CloudCannon forms. We've also added additional HTTP status code options for redirects using `routing.json`, and a fix for an SSL issue.

**Features:**

* [CloudCannon forms now support file uploads](/documentation/articles/connecting-your-site-to-an-inbox/#receiving-files-through-your-forms)
* [CloudCannon routing now supports `410` and `200` redirects](/documentation/articles/configuring-custom-routing/)

**Fixes:**

* Fixed an issue preventing new SSL certificates from being installed
* Fixed an issue causing presigned uploads to time out
