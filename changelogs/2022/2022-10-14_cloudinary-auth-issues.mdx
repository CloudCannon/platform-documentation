This release addresses several issues with connecting to Cloudinary within CloudCannon.  Any further issues should be fixed by refreshing your browser.

Weâ€™ve also released fixes for form attachments, SSL certificates, and a few UI bugs.

**Fixes:**

* Fixed several Cloudinary auth issues
* Client share users can now access CloudCannon Form attachments
* Fixed an issue preventing Custom SSL certificates from being uploaded to Cloudflare
* Fixed a bug where attempting to create a site without a name would break the UI
* Site collaborators with the Technical Editor permission level can now see Build Deploy reports
