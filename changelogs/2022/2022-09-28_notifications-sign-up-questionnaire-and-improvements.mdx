This release includes a visual update to our in-app notifications, better communication about organization billing, and some behind-the-scenes performance improvements.

For new users, this release adds a short questionnaire at the end of the sign up flow. By answering three quick questions, new users can tailor their initial experience and better see how CloudCannon can work for them.

Also included are fixes to a couple of visual bugs.

**Features:**

* Questionnaire for new users to help tailor their experience
* Updated the look of the app notifications
* New in-app notifications for organizations with expiring credit cards
* Added a badge next to [Partner users](https://cloudcannon.com/partner-program/) in the team list

**Fixes:**

* Fixed the scrolling behavior on file diffs
* Browser filter persistence will no longer clash across sites
