This release brings our series of [editor improvements and features](https://cloudcannon.com/blog/saving-time-our-new-editor-improvements/) to everyone in CloudCannon. After weeks of Beta testing and ironing out a few bugs, we are excited to bring this new functionality to users. Our release from Beta also includes several new features and bug fixes:

* New save button behavior
* New review screen for unsaved changes
* Edit immediately after saving changes, even while your build is in progress
* Allowed editing of front matter on unpublished HTML files in the visual editor
* New option `new_preview_url` to set your preview to another page’s output URL
* Support for nested inputs in `_inputs` config (e.g. `seo.title` will select `title` within the `seo` object)
* Search added to our documentation using [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/)

**Fixes:**

* Fixed regression in syncing file permissions
* Fixed syncing issue with large diffs
* Fixed syncing issue with private submodules
* Filenames are trimmed when files are created

* Fixed issue closing split editor after being prompted to discard changes

**Beta Features:**

Some features on CloudCannon can be turned on by the support team. These are still in testing and are subject to change. Reach out to support if you want to try these new features.

**Need more time on the old version?**

If you, your team, or your clients need time to acclimate to the new saving flow and prefer to switch to the old way, we’ve added access to *Legacy CloudCannon* in your account settings menu.
