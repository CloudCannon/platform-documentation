This release contains a new Organization setup guide to help on-board new organizations. This replaces the 'Home' menu item in the app sidebar. Your organization dashboard can now be accessed by clicking the logo in the top of the sidebar.

We've also added the ability to trial the Team Plan, and you can now view the sync logs for your site. Also included in this release are a number of bug fixes.

**Features:**

* Organization setup guide
* Organizations that are on trial of the Standard Plan can now upgrade their trial to the Team Plan. This will not extend your trial duration
* Sync logs are now available on your site status page, which may help you debug syncing issues
* Emojis are now allowed in site names ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’¯ðŸ˜ŽðŸ™Œ

**Fixes:**

* Fixed a bug preventing new DNS records from being shown after creating them in the app
* Quoted status codes in routing.json will now be correctly processed
