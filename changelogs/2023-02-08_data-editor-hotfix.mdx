This release fixes a bug that made the Data Editor fail to load.

A number of items that were documented in our last changelog were not included in the previous release. They have been included in this release, and we apologize for any confusion caused.

**Fixes:**

* Fixed a bug where certain inputs with null values caused the Data Editor to crash
* Fixed SAML authentication callbacks for subpath sites
