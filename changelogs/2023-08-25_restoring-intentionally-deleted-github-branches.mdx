title: Restoring intentionally deleted GitHub branches
type: minor
---
This release addressed minor issues, including CloudCannon restoring intentionally deleted GitHub branches, and file deletion when renaming to the same name.

**Fixes:**

* Intentionally deleted GitHub branches are less likely to be restored by CloudCannon.
* Fixed an issue where renaming a file to the same name would delete the file.
