title: Publishing Conflict Resolution, Domains rework, and more!
---
Features from our most recent Beta are now available to all users. These features include a Publishing Conflict resolution workflow, a rework of the *Domains* section, updates to the *Publishing* and *Status* pages, improvements for the Source Editor, changes to the *Context menu* file actions, and several other updates.

Thank you to everyone who assisted in our Publishing Conflict Resolution Private Beta. Your feedback is always valuable to our team.

If required, you can return to the Legacy version of the app at any time using the *Enter CloudCannon Legacy* option in the *Account menu*. You can also enable CloudCannon Legacy per Site if you use Client Sharing. CloudCannon Legacy is available for a short time. CloudCannon will support the Legacy app until June 3rd, 2025. If you have any feedback, please get in touch with our [support team](/support/) or contact us through your dedicated Slack channel.

This release also addresses issues in various areas of the app.

## Features & Improvements

### Publishing Conflict Resolution

You no longer need to rely on your developer or Git provider to resolve [Publishing Conflicts](/documentation/articles/what-are-publishing-conflicts/) â€” you can do it in CloudCannon! When updating your Site from its Publish Branch reveals a Publishing Conflict, CloudCannon will list all conflicted files on the *Publishing* page and allow you to resolve this issue by selecting which version of a file to keep, or create a hybrid of your current and incoming changes.

For more information, please read our documentation on [resolving Publishing Conflicts](/documentation/articles/resolve-publishing-conflicts/).

<comp.Notice info_type="permissions">
  **Permissions required**

  Members of the Owners, Developers, and Technical Editors [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/), or [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/) with the `site:source-editor:write` and `site:publish:upstream:write` permissions, can resolve Publishing Conflicts.
</comp.Notice>

* When you click the *Update from Publish Branch* button on the *Publishing* page to update your Site from its Publish Branch, CloudCannon may detect a Publishing Conflict. A Publishing Conflict occurs when the version of a file incoming from your Publish Branch and the version of the same file on your current branch do not match.
* You must resolve your Publishing Conflicts, or abandon the attempt to update your Site from it's Publish Branch, before you can publish to your Publish Branch or save changes to your files without addressing the conflicted files.
* To prevent CloudCannon from detecting Publishing Conflicts while someone is editing your Site, you cannot attempt to update from your Publish Branch while you have unsaved changes.
  * We do not recommend editing your files while an update attempt is in progress, unless those edits are related to a conflict.

* CloudCannon will alert you to a Publishing Conflict with a red warning notification over the *Publish* button, *Conflict* badges on affected files in the *Collection browser*, and a warning banner in all editing interfaces.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-05/CloudCannon-Changelog-May2025-Collection-browser-with-conflicts.png" alt="A screenshot of the Collection browser shows a red warning notification on the Publish button and red Conflict badges on conflicted files." title="The Collection browser" type="screenshot"/>

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-05/CloudCannon-Changelog-May2025-Content-Editor-Conflict-Baner.png" alt="A screenshot of the Content Editor shows a red Publishing Conflict warning banner." title="The Content Editor" type="screenshot"/>

* When CloudCannon detects a Publishing Conflict, it will show you a list of all files with incoming changes, including files with conflicts, on the *Publishing* page.
* When you click on the card for a conflicted file, CloudCannon will open the Source Editor and highlight the conflicted sections. CloudCannon will highlight the changes to the file from your current branch in red and the incoming changes from the Publish Branch in green.
* You can click on the *Use current* or *Use incoming* buttons to replace one change with another or click into the Source Editor to make a hybrid of the changes manually.
* You can quickly move to the next conflict in a large file by clicking the *Scroll to next conflict* button.
* When you have finished resolving conflicts in a file, you can click the *Mark as resolved* button to save the file.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-05/CloudCannon-Changelog-May2025-Publishing-Page-Conflict-Closed.png" alt="A screenshot of the Publishing pages shows CloudCannon has detected Publishing Conflicts in two files." title="The Publishing page" type="screenshot"/>

* When you have resolved all conflicted files, click the *Update from Publish Branch* button. CloudCannon will complete the update from your Publish Branch.
* If you resolve all conflicted files, CloudCannon will also save any unsaved changes made to your Site after the update attempt began.
* Alternatively, if you do not want to resolve your Publishing Conflicts immediately, you can abandon the attempt to update your Site from its Publish Branch using the *Abandon update attempt* button on the *Publishing* page.
* If you abandon your update attempt, CloudCannon will discard all unsaved changes.
* After abandoning your update attempt, you can return to editing your files and saving changes. CloudCannon will remove all warnings about Publishing Conflicts. However, you must still resolve your Publishing Conflicts before you can publish changes from this Site to your Publish Branch.
* CloudCannon will remind you about any unresolved Publishing Conflicts the next time you try to publish from this Site or update from your Publish Branch.
* If CloudCannon detects a Publishing Conflict that you cannot solve in the Source Editor (e.g., a conflict in an image file), the update from your Publish Branch will fail.
* For more information on a failed update attempt, please see your most recent Syncing log.

### *Domains* section rework

To provide a better hosting experience on CloudCannon, we've improved the appearance and functionality of the *Domains* section of the app, and consolidated Custom Domain related settings into a single location.

* The app now uses more consistent language regarding Custom Domains, such as "connecting" and "disconnecting" a domain from your Organizations, or "adding" and "removing" domains from Sites in CloudCannon.
* We have updated the *Domains browser*, found using the *Domains* button in the *App sidebar*.
* The *Domains browser* shows all domains connected to your Organization. Each Custom Domain is represented by a card.
* Metadata on each Domain card shows you the status of your Custom Domain, how many subdomains are connected through CloudCannon, and whether the Custom Domain uses CloudCannon or External DNS.
* In addition to connecting a Custom Domain through your *Site Settings*, you can now connect a domain to your Organization using the *\+ Connect a Domain* button in the top right of the *Domains browser*.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-05/CloudCannon-Changelog-May2025-Domains-Browser.png" alt="A screenshot of the Domains Browser shows a list of connected domains and the Connect a Domain button." title="The Domains Browser" type="screenshot"/>

* When connecting a domain to your Organization, CloudCannon now requires you to select your DNS provider upfront, prevent you from seeing incorrect setup instructions in app.
* When you click the *Connect Domain* button, CloudCannon will take you to that domain's dedicated *Domain* page.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-05/CloudCannon-Changelog-May2025-Connect-Domain-Page.png" alt="A screenshot of the Connect a Domain page shows a text field for your domain name and radio buttons to select your DNS Provider." title="The Connect a Domain page" type="screenshot"/>

* The *Domain* page allows you to review and manage all settings for a given Custom Domain. Some Custom Domain settings from the *Custom Domain* page under *Site Settings* have been moved to this location.
* The *Domain* page has four tabs: the *Network* tab, the *DNS* tab, the *Sites* tab, and the *Domain Settings* tab.
* The *Network* tab shows the status of your Nameservers, lists all your subdomains in a *Subdomains browser*, and shows the Fallback redirect for all unconfigured subdomains.
  * You can now select the subdomain for the Fallback redirect using a dropdown, rather than a list.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-05/CloudCannon-Changelog-May2025-Domain-Page-Network-Tab.png" alt="A screenshot of the Domain page Network tab shows the status of your nameservers, the Subdomains browser, and the fallback redirect." title="The Domain page Network tab" type="screenshot"/>

* Clicking on a subdomain card in the *Subdomains browser* will open the *Subdomains* section of the *Network* tab.
* The *Subdomains* section allows you to configure your Hosting Setup and SSL, and also has a *Sites browser* for all Sites connected to that subdomain.
  * You may only see one Site in the Subdomain *Sites browser*. If you host multiple Sites on Subpaths, these will appear here.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-05/CloudCannon-Changelog-May2025-Domain-Network-Subdomain-Page.png" alt="A screenshot of the subdomain section of the Network tab shows the hosting setup, SSL configuration, and Sites connected to a subdomain." title="The Subdomain section" type="screenshot"/>

* The *DNS* tab lists all DNS records configured for your domain, and includes a search bar and *Create record* button in the top right. You can edit or delete each DNS record using the *Context Menu* in the top right of the card.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-05/CloudCannon-Changelog-May2025-Domain-Page-DNS-Tab.png" alt="A screenshot of the Domain page DNS tab shows all the DNS records for a Custom Domain and the Add Record button." title="The Domain page DNS tab" type="screenshot"/>

* The *Sites* tab lists of all Sites connected to your domain. You can navigate to a Site by clicking on the card.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-05/CloudCannon-Changelog-May2025-Domain-Page-Sites-Tab.png" alt="A screenshot of the Domain page Sites tab shows a list of all CloudCannon Sites on a Custom Domain." title="The Domain page Sites tab" type="screenshot"/>

* The *Domain Settings* tab has two sections: *Details* and *Danger*. You can edit your *DNS Provider* or disconnect the domain from your Organization.
* You cannot disconnect a Custom Domain from your Organization until you have removed it from all CloudCannon Sites.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-05/CloudCannon-Changelog-May2025-Domain-Page-Settings-Tab.png" alt="A screenshot of the Domain page Domain Settings tab shows radio buttons for switching DNS Provider." title="The Domain page Settings tab" type="screenshot"/>

* &nbsp;The *Custom Domain* page under *Site Settings* no longer shows your hosting setup, nameserver status, or SSL settings. These settings are now on your Domain page.
* You can add a Custom Domain to your Site from the *Custom Domain* page, or connect a new domain to your Organization, using the *Base Domain* dropdown.
* When adding a Custom Domain to your Site, CloudCannon now requires you to select a subdomain or subpath up front.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-05/CloudCannon-Changelog-May2025-Site-Settings-Custom-Domain-Add.png" alt="A screenshot of the Custom Domain page under Site Settings shows a domain name and two text fields for adding a subdomain or subpath." title="The Custom Domain page" type="screenshot"/>

* Once you have added a Custom Domain to your Site, the *Custom Domain* page will provide a link to that domain's dedicated *Domain* page.
* The *Remove Custom Domain* button will remove the Custom Domain from your Site, but will not disconnect it from your Organization.

### *Publishing* page updates

We improved the appearance and functionality of the *Publishing* page with tabs

* The *Publishing* page now has a *Summary* tab. The *Changes* and *Commits* tabs have moved to the top of the page to be more consistent with other areas in the app.
* The *Summary* tab has three sections: the *Publish* section, *Changes* section, and *Commits* section.
* The inputs in the *Publish* section allow you to publish your Site to its Publish Branch, or delete the Site. This section will look different depending on which publishing method you have enabled for your Site: merge changes immediately, or create a Pull Request.
* The *Changes* section on this tab shows the total number of files with saved changes and the three most recently changed files. It also has a *See more* link to the *Changes* tab if there are more than three files with changes.
* The *Commits* section on this tab shows the two most recent commits made on this Site. It also has a *See more* link to the *Commits* tab if there are more than two commits.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-05/CloudCannon-Changelog-May2025-Publishing-Page-Summary-Tab.png" alt="A screenshot of the Publishing page Summary tab shows inputs for creating a Pull Request and previews for Changes and Commits on this Site." title="The Publishing page Summary tab" type="screenshot"/>

* The *Changes* tab lists all the files with saved changes on your Site.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-05/CloudCannon-Changelog-May2025-Publishing-Page-Changes-Tab.png" alt="A screenshot of the Publishing page Changes tab shows a list of all files with saved changes on your Site." title="The Publishing page Changes tab" type="screenshot"/>

* The *Commits* tab lists all the commits made on your Site. If you click the *View* button on a commit card, CloudCannon will open that commit's page on your Git provider's website in another tab.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-05/CloudCannon-Changelog-May2025-Publishing-Page-Commits-Tab.png" alt="A screenshot of the Publishing page Commits tab shows a list of commits made on your Site." title="The Publishing page Commits tab" type="screenshot"/>

* Improved the UI for pending Pull Requests on the *Publishing* page.
* The Pull Request UI now includes PR details, such as title, description, datetime, relevant branches, and a link to your Git provider.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-05/CloudCannon-Changelog-May2025-Publishing-Page-Pull-Request-UI.png" alt="A screenshot of the Pull Request UI on the Publishing Page shows the PR details, including date, title, branches, and a link to the Git provider." title="The Pull Request UI" type="ui-snippet"/>

### *Status* page updates

We have updated the appearance and functionality of the *Recommendations* task list on the *Status* page.

* &nbsp;We have updated the appearance of the *Recommendations* task list on the *Status* page, in preparation for more Site setup suggestions.
* You can now add a Site Icon to the root folder of your Git repository using the *Upload Site Icon* button in the *Recommendations* task list.
* You can now generate an Initial Site Settings file in the `.cloudcannon` folder of your Git repository using the *Generate initial-site-settings.json* button in the *Recommendations* task list. You can also generate this file from the *Build Configuration* page, under *Site Settings*.

### Source Editor updates

This release updated the engine for our Source Editor.

* The Source Editor now has better syntax highlighting, specifically in files with YAML front matter and markdown content.
* The Source Editor now supports normal and regex search using the `CMD+F` or `CTRL+F` keyboard shortcut.
* You can now edit your files on multiple lines simultaneously. Highlight a string in the Source Editor and use the `CMD+D` or `CTRL+D` keyboard shortcut to add multiple cursors at every instance of that string in the document.
* The new engine for our Source Editor has an expanded list of color themes. The new default theme is `basic_dark`.
* The Source Editor now supports Publishing Conflict highlighting.
* The new engine allows us to add more editing interface configuration in the future.

### *Context Menu* file action updates

We added the *View diff* file action to the file *Context Menu* and renamed the *Clone* action to *Duplicate*.

* Added the *View diff* file action to the *Context Menu*, allowing you to review the unsaved changes for a file in text format.
* CloudCannon will highlight deleted content in red and new content in green. CloudCannon will highlight content that has no changes, but where a change is present on the same line, in yellow.
* Before this release, the *Clone* file action in the *Context Menu* would create an exact copy of the file, including any [instance values](/documentation/articles/configure-your-inputs/#instance_value) in inputs. This behavior was often undesired as multiple files would have the same UUID or the date would not reflect the time the file was created.
* The *Clone* file action is now called *Duplicate* and generates new values for instance values.

### Other features & improvements

* Renamed the *Review changes* modal to the *Save changes* modal and updated the copy on the *Save* button to better reflect their functions.
* Added support for [Google's Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Symbols).
* Renamed the *Conflicting updates* status to *Syncing is paused* to better reflect the app state, and removed the warning notification from the *Site navigation*.
* CloudCannon will alert you when Syncing is paused with a red warning notification over the *Save* button and a warning notification in the *Save changes* modal.
* Improved accessibility by replacing all *Click to confirm* buttons in the app this *Confirm* modals.
* Added more documentation links to the app.
* Updated messaging on the *Build Pending* page.
* Select and multiselect inputs with the `allow_create` option enabled now have more accurate suggestion text.
* Color inputs now support alpha for Hex values.
* Added the `icon_background_color` configuration key for `preview`, `preview.metadata[*]`, and `preview.gallery`. This key allows you to specify a background color for icons, in case the value for `icon_color` is not visible against the white background of the app.
* Added the `background_color` configuration key for `preview.gallery`. This key allows you to specify a background color for the gallery section of a card when displaying an icon, in case the value for `icon_color` is not visible against the white background of the app.

## Fixes

* &nbsp;Fixed an issue where, when configuring Snippets, CloudCannon incorrectly required you to define the `view` key within the `preview` object. You now configure the `view` key directly inside the Snippet.
