title: Extensionless URLs
type: minor
---

This release features support for extensionless URLs and improved unbuilt file handling in the *Visual Editor*.

**Features:**

* Extensionless URL support
* Option to redirect to extensionless URLs
* New *Site Settings* / *Hosting* section with consolidated options

**Fixes:**

* Opening unbuilt files in the *Visual Editor* waits for build
* `_comments` and `_defaults` populated by Jekyll defaults work for non-output and unbuilt files
* Non-output HTML collection items open in full screen front matter editor rather than error
* Creating a collection item with a text extension no longer adds that to the title/name field
