**Features:**

* Simplified context menu for editing arrays. The option to add a new structure is now a sub-context menu
* Added support for `Referrer-Policy` and `Permissions-Policy` as [custom headers](/documentation/articles/configuring-custom-routing/#custom-headers)

**Fixes:**

* Fixed unclear error message when failing to login with a provider
