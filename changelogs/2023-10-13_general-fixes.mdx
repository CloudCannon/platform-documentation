This release addressed issues affecting editor loading, Jekyll sites using Ruby 2.6, and error messaging for client-sharing sites.

**Fixes:**

* Fixed an issue where some configurations would prevent editors from loading.
* Fixed an issue where Jekyll sites using Ruby 2.6 failed to build.
* Client-sharing sites that have not been built now have better error messaging.
