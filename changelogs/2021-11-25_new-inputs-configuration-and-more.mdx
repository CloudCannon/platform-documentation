title: New inputs configuration and more
type: major
---
This release introduces [configuration for inputs](/documentation/articles/configure-your-inputs/) separate from the naming conventions. It's all backwards compatible, and we have a [migration guide](/documentation/articles/migrating-to-input-configuration/) to start changing your sites over. There are a number of new inputs and options for each.

**Features:**

* [Color inputs](/documentation/articles/color-inputs/) have new `format` and `alpha` options, falling back to the naming convention if these options are not set.
* [Hiding inputs](/documentation/articles/configure-your-inputs/#configuration) is now set with `hidden` in an `_inputs` entry rather than an option, since itâ€™s available for any input type. This key also supports a string where the input is hidden based on the value of another input. This can start with a `!` to reverse the value.
* [Object structures are now supported](/documentation/articles/object-inputs/#options). These allow you to configure objects between an empty state (`null`) and a selection of object formats. Useful if you have components with a limited number of sub-components.
* Two new inputs: [Range number input](/documentation/articles/number-inputs/#range) and a [Switch boolean input](/documentation/articles/configure-your-boolean-inputs/#switch). These are only available with the new inputs config. More input types coming soon, contact support if you have specific requests.
* [Comments](/documentation/articles/configure-your-inputs/) now support a limited set of Markdown: links, bold, italic, subscript, superscript and inline code elements are allowed. Links in this block also support [Editor Links](/documentation/articles/extending-in-app-navigation-with-editor-links/).
* Better object previews with configurable text and subtext.
* Select and multiselect inputs now have the `value_key` option to set how values are saved, and the `text_key` option for setting how values are displayed.
* Added disabled input type for visible, uneditable text values.
* `step`, `min` and `max` options for number inputs.
* Configuration for changing the label and type of an input separate from the naming conventions.

**Fixes:**

* Number inputs are invalid if they don't contain numbers.
* Corrected the textarea input naming convention from `text` to `textarea`.
* Clone page is now hidden if `_disable_add` is `true`.
* Webhooks now fail if they have no site attached.
* HTML, Markdown and Code Block is no longer stripped from input labels.
* Fixed some valid values not being allowed when adding DNS records.
