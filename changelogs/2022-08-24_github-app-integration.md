This release supports integrating with GitHub through GitHub Apps, enabling fine-grained permission on access to repositories and reducing permissions scope.  All existing GitHub integrations will continue to work.

**Features:**

* 🆕 GitHub App integration.
* Fine grained permission on GitHub repositories access. Only grant access to a limited number of repositories.
* Reduced the number GitHub permissions required.
* A new GitHub OAuth will conduct all logins with GitHub. As a result of this upgrade, you might need to authorize your account again.
* Included are steps to migrate to the new GitHub App integration, found in  Organization **Settings &gt; Files &gt; GitHub**. Once migrated, a confirmation email will provide a link to revoke any old authentication in GitHub.
* Input configuration support for array items, through nested selectors (e.g. `_inputs.gallery[*]`).

**Fixes:**

* Fixed issue not updating tokens when logging in with a storage provider.
* Fixed error message displayed when failing to authenticate with storage provider.
