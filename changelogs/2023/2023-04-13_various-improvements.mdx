This release includes a number of fixes and quality-of-life improvements.

**Features:**

* You can now hover over your site name and branch, to see the full text in cases where it is otherwise too long to see. The site name can also span two lines for better readability on desktop.
* Clarified source syncing behaviour by adding extra explanatory text in the settings.
* The site status icon will now show an hourglass icon while the site is waiting for a build to start.

**Fixes:**

* The "Download Backup" button no longer unnecessarily warns you about losing unsaved changes.
* Fixed a UI issue preventing the documentation for organisation setup from staying open in the app.
* Manually scheduled builds now respect your configured timezone.
* Fixed an issue with setting custom SSL for a site.
