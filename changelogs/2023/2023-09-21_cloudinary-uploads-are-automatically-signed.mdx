title: Cloudinary uploads are automatically signed
type: minor
---
This release added an automatic signature to uploads through the Cloudinary widget, a check box to lock uploads, and updated dependencies for Node and Hugo. It also addressed an issue affecting invoice emails.

**Features:**

* Uploads using the Cloudinary widget are now signed automatically.
* You can prevent uploads to your Cloudinary DAM by checking 'uploads locked'. This is now independent of your preset. 'Uploads locked' is automatically enabled for users with no preset to maintain expected behavior.
* Updated dependencies for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="/documentation/articles/managing-your-node-version-with-nvm/">Node</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="/documentation/articles/what-version-of-go-is-used-in-the-build-environment/">Hugo</a>.

**Fixes:**

* Fixed an issue where users could unsubscribe from invoice emails.
