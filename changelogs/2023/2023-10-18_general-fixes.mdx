This release addressed issues affecting jQuery, the CloudCannon configuration file prompt, and missing icons in rich text editors.

**Fixes:**

* jQuery is now loaded from the CloudCannon CDN instead of jQuery CDN to support CloudCannon loading more reliably.
* CloudCannon configuration file prompt will no longer appear if CLOUDCANNON_CONFIG_PATH is set.
* Fixed an issue where icons were missing from the link, snippet, and image popups in rich text editors.
