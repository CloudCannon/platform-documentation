This release addressed issues affecting site migration from NetlifyCMS, the capacity for the owner of a partner organization to manage team members in client organizations, context menus opening in the wrong place, and bold text in the rich text editor.

**Fixes:**

* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon could not load your site if there was more than one NetlifyCMS config file found during site migration.
* Fixed an issue where the owner of a partner organization could not manage team members in client organizations.
* Fixed an issue where context menus were opening in the incorrect place.
* Fixed an issue where bold text was escaped if followed by a space.
