This release addressed security vulnerabilities, removed autocomplete options from password fields, and reviewed the access control checks for admin-level API endpoints. It also addressed issues affecting access to the Targets tab by Client Sharing users, and special characters preventing file list loading.

**Fixes:**

* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
* Removed autocomplete options from password fields in the CloudCannon app.
* Reviewed access control checks for admin-level API endpoints.
* Fixed an issue where Client Sharing users could not access the Targets tab for form submissions.
* Fixed an issue where including special characters in a file name would sometimes prevent file lists from loading.
