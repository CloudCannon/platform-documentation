This release provides increased support for static sites built with Astro and marks the end of our beta. 

Try our [Sendit template](https://app.cloudcannon.com/editor#sites/connect/github/CloudCannon/sendit-astro-template/main), a fully featured Astro template optimized for visual editing in CloudCannon. Check out [our starter guide for Astro](/documentation/guides/astro-starter-guide/) here.

**Features:**

* [Commit message templates](/documentation/articles/configure-your-commit-messages/) are now available to all users.

* Updated build suggestions for errors occurring on some versions of Astro.
