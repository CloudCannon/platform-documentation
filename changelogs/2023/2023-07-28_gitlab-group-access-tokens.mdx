You can now authenticate with GitLab using a group access token, to give CloudCannon access to more finely scoped sets of resources. See [our documentation about this feature](/documentation/developer-articles/connecting-a-gitlab-respository-as-your-source/) for more information.

**Features:**

* Support for GitLab group access tokens.

**Fixes:**

* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
* Fixed some errors that could occur when editing a Markdown file with no front matter.
* jQuery is now loaded from the jQuery CDN instead of from Google, to support CloudCannon being loaded more reliably.
* Fixed an error preventing visual editing of data files.
* DAM uploads now respect the prefix configured in the site settings properly.
* Added some checks to avoid sending notification emails about situations that have already been resolved.
* Fixed an issue which sometimes prevented the data editor from loading.
* Fixed an issue which sometimes broke Markdown headings directly adjacent to snippets.
