This release adds support for payments that require Strong Customer Authentication (SCA). This includes cards that are protected using 3D Secure 2.

**Features:**

* Support for payments with SCA.
* Azure DAMs now have an option to tag uploaded files with the email of the user who uploaded them.
* Added a button on the login screen to go back after selecting "Log in with email".
* Added a short survey for new team members joining CloudCannon.
* Updated the UI in the Assets section of the site settings to show more information.
* Added an option to use existing DAM files when a clash is detecting during upload, and fixed the option to cancel the upload altogether.

**Fixes:**

* Output files starting with underscores can now be selected when linking to another page.
* The "Close" button on pull requests is now red to make it clearer that it will remove the pull request.
* Inputs can now respect instance values configured on a schema.
* Keys in nested schemas are now correctly sorted and deleted according to the `reorder_inputs` and `remove_extra_inputs` options.
* Fixed a bug preventing existing images from being added to a page on sites with a Jekyll `base_url`.
* A confirmation step is now required before files in Azure DAMs can be overwritten by a new upload.
* Patched potential security vulnerabilities.
* URLs saved from a main asset source Cloudinary DAM no longer include the asset type, delivery type, and version prefixes.
* URLs saved after uploading an asset via the Cloudinary widget now respect your main asset source.
* Fixed a caching error occurring on Hugo sites using Bookshop.
