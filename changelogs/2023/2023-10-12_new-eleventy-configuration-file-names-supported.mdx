This release added additional security measures to our payment processes and support for new Eleventy configuration file names. It also addressed several issues, including 'page not found' errors in the sign-up process, Google Chrome incorrectly displaying the CloudCannon sidebar, and CloudCannon incorrectly reporting GitHub branch protection as a merge conflict.

**Features:**

* Security updates to payment processes.
* CloudCannon now supports new <a target="_blank" href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/">Eleventy configuration file names</a> (v2.0.0) by default.

**Fixes:**

* Fixed an issue where some links would result in a 'page not found' error during sign-up.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon would incorrectly report a merge conflict error when GitHub could not merge a branch due to branch protection settings.
* Fixed an issue where an invalid configuration caused an error with context menus.
* Fixed an issue where long text caused cards in the Data Editor to overflow.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon did not highlight sites with failed builds in red text on the sites list.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon did not apply instance values from schemas.
* Fixed an issue where some CloudCannon configurations would generate duplicate collections for Jekyll sites.
* Fixed an issue where the Google Chrome browser would not render the CloudCannon sidebar correctly.
* Fixed an issue where some Bookshop sites failed to load in the client editor.
* Fixed an issue where content security policies prevented sites from loading in the Visual Editor.
* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.

**Future Changes:**

In an upcoming release, we will update how you view your Projects and Domains.

The Projects page will have a full-width list of all your branches and a settings tab to edit your project details.

In addition to a new aesthetic, we will also have some functionality changes. When you create a new project, you will be able to select a repository you have not yet connected to CloudCannon. You will also be able to create new branches off of existing branches and your main branch.

The Domains page will also have a cleaner interface, with navigation that is consistent with other pages in the CloudCannon app.

We're looking forward to bringing you these updates soon!
