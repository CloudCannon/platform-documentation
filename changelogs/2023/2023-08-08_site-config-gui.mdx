* Support for adding keys to [object inputs](/documentation/articles/configure-your-object-inputs/) in the Data Editor.
* Added options for grouping inputs in collapsible sections.
* Added a placeholder option for inputs.
* Root selector `$` for input configuration now resets within structures.
* Leading and trailing whitespace is now trimmed from each excluded path in the Build Deploys settings.

**Fixes:**

* Fix 404 redirects when trying to generate a new code on the sign-up page.
* Fixed some issues where generated CloudCannon config files didn't pull across all the available information.
* Fixed an error that could occur when editing arrays of dates.
* Fixed an error preventing API endpoints from being configured correctly for Cloudflare R2 DAMs.
* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
* Fixed an issue where git garbage collection could impact large syncs.
