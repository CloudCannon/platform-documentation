This release added new options for handling merge commits if CloudCannon detects a force push to your repository. It also addressed security vulnerabilities and issues affecting the template deploy button and image path deletion.

**Features:**

* When you force push to your repository, CloudCannon will offer remediation options to prevent unexpected merge commits.

**Fixes:**

* Fixed an issue where template deploy buttons had a 404 error.
* Fixed an issue where an image with a relative path would have its path removed.
* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
