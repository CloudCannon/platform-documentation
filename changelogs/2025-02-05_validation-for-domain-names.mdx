title: Validation for domain names
---
This release added validation for domain names, better error messaging, and optimized screenshot fetching.

It also addressed several issues, including those affecting the File browser, new branch names in GitHub, and ExpressVPN browser extension behavior.

## Features & Improvements

* Added validation for domain names.
* Better error messaging when CloudCannon requires SSO to access an Organization.
* Optimized the number of times CloudCannon fetches screenshots.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue causing the *File browser* to appear blank when the CloudCannon configuration file was misconfigured.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon would convert a `/` character in a new branch name into the `-` character before pushing it to GitHub.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, the ExpressVPN browser extension would inject scripts into CloudCannon editing interfaces.
* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
