title: YAML Hotfix
type: minor
---

This small release fixes an error preventing adding new array items in the front matter and YAML editor in some configurations.

**Fixes:**

* Fixed adding new array items in YAML in some configurations
* Fixed some validation error messages not appearing next to form inputs on save
* Moved split screen toggle to not obscure YAML in some cases
* Fixed a potential issue causing the editor to remain on the "Finalising Changes" step
