This release

### Features:

* Released the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/site-mounting/">Site Mounting</a>&nbsp;feature.&nbsp;
  * This feature makes one site dependent on one or more other CloudCannon sites. Files from a remote site will be accessible to the local site at build time, and any updates to the remote site will trigger a build of the local site.
  * You can find the Site Mountings feature under Site Settings.
  * Site Mounting is available on the Standard, Team, and Enterprise plans.
* Released appearance update for the Project page.
  * The Publishing tab on the Project page now displays a diagram illustrating which sites publish to other sites within the project.

### Fixes:

* Added new Command Line Option --logLevel for Hugo v0.114.0 and later. Older CLI options are still supported for earlier versions of Hugo.
* Better warning messaging on the Organization list when payment issues occur.
* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
