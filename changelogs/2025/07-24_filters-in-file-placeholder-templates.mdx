title: Filters in file placeholder templates
---
This release added filters to file placeholder templates.

It also addressed an issue affecting `mjs` MIME types.

### Features & Improvements

* You can now use [filters](/documentation/articles/configure-your-template-strings/#filters) and reference data values in file placeholder templates.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````

collections_config:
  blog:
    url___1___: /[full_slug|deburr]
  articles:
    url___2___: /[full_slug|unless=permalink]

``````````
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  In this example, CloudCannon will convert the `full_slug` to basic Latin letters and remove combining diacritical marks.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="2">
  In this example, CloudCannon will use the `full_slug` as the output path for files in the Articles Collection, unless you set a value for `permalink` in the frontmatter of the file.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

### Fixes

* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon would return an incorrect MIME type for `*.mjs` files.
* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
