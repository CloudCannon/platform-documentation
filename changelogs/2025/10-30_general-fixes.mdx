This release addressed issues affecting Number Input validation and error messaging when uploading a profile picture.

### Fixes

* Fixed an issue where Number Inputs with `required` Input validation did not accept `0` as a value.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon would enter an infinite *Loading...* state after a failed attempt to upload a profile picture, rather than provide an error message.
* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
