title: Restoring Source Editor default wrapping behavior

This release updated the `soft_wrap` default behavior, how you manage Client Sharing on Orgs with a billing issue, and the UI for managing credit cards.

It also addressed several issues affecting badges on Site cards, uploading a Configuration File, adding a Custom Domain, and invalid characters in filenames.

## Features & Improvements

* The `soft_wrap` configuration key for the Source Editor now defaults to `true` to preserve the behavior of the editing interface before the [engine update](/documentation/changelog/2025/05/13/publishing-conflict-resolution-domains-rework-and-more.html#source-editor-updates).
* You can now turn off Client Sharing when your Organization has a billing issue.
* The credit card list on the *Subscription* pages now shows which card is in use.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, an *Edited* badge would appear on Site cards in the *Sites browser* when there were no unsaved changes.
* Fixed an issue where, after uploading Site files including a Configuration File, CloudCannon did not immediately apply your Configuration File to your Site.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, you could not add a Custom Domain to your Site.
* Fixed an issue where invalid characters in a filename prevented CloudCannon from syncing correctly.
* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
