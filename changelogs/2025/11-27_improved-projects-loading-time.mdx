title: Improved Projects loading time
---
This release improved loading time for the *Projects Browser* and added better error handling, Ruby file syntax highlighting, and an *Export as CSV* button for bandwidth.

It also addressed several issues affecting the Datetime Input and adding base domains.

### Features & Improvements

* Improved loading time for the *Projects Browser*.
* Better error handling when loading your *Site* configuration.
* Added syntax highlighting for `.rb` files in the Code Editor.
* Added an *Export as CSV* button below the *Bandwidth Table* for the *Usage* tab on your *Site Dashboard* and *Org Home* pages.

### Fixes

* Fixed an issue where adding a date to a Datetime Input did not work unless time was also added. It now defaults to `00:00:00`.
* Fixed an issue where you could incorrectly add a subdomain to your base domain.
