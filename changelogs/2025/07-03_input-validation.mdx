title: Input validation
---
Input validation is now available for all input types! Configure input validation keys to ensure you never forget a value (or enter the wrong one) again.

Thank you to everyone who provided feedback on our [CloudCannon Community post](https://community.cloudcannon.com/t/upcoming-input-validation-feature/235). We love collaborating with you on our features.

This release also updated the Lite plan to include email form targets, and added pagination when listing DNS records, and addressed several issues affecting add-on warning emails, stripping markup in the Content Editor, billing information, and filters in the *Domains browser*.

### Features and Improvements

### Input validation

* Added input validation for all input types in the Data, Content, and Visual Editor.
* When you configure input validation for an input, CloudCannon will require the input value to meet predefined criteria before you can save your changes.
* If you enter an invalid value, CloudCannon will warn you with an error message next to the input and in the *Save changes* modal.

* CloudCannon will disable the *Save* button in the *Save changes* modal until all invalid values are corrected.
* Depending on the input type, can now configure the following keys under `options`:
  * `required`: require a value
  * `max_file_size`: limit uploaded files by file size
  * `max_items`, `min_items`: specify to number of items allowed in an Array, Muliselect, or Multichoice input
  * `max_length`, `min_length`: specify the number of text characters allowed
  * `start_from`, `end_before`: specify the allowed range for a Date or Datetime input
  * `pattern`: specify a <a href="https://re2js.leopard.in.ua/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">regular expression</a> that the input value must match
  * `unique_on`: specify the JSON Path selector that CloudCannon should use to determine if the value of an Input is unique
* The existing Number input configuration keys `max` and `min` will now validate you input value.
* CloudCannon has default error messages for when a value does not meet validation criteria. You can customize the error message for all input validation configuration keys using the matching message key under `options`: `required_message`, `max_message`, `min_message`, `max_file_size_message`, `max_items_message`, `min_items_message`, `max-length-message`, `min_length_message`, `start_from_message`, `end_before_message`, `pattern_message`, `unique_on_message`.
* You can also configure input validation for inputs in your commit message template, allowing you to require a commit message when you save your changes.
