title: New Inbox options for Client Sharing
---
This release added new Inbox options for allowing Client Sharing users to log in to CloudCannon from a notification email.

It also addressed several issues, including those affecting MFA permissions, Organization-level Flag permissions, and form reCAPTCHA.

## Features & Improvements

* Added the *Use Client Sharing to view attached files* option for existing Inboxes and the *File attachment settings* option for existing Inboxes.
  * Previously, [Client Sharing](/documentation/articles/what-is-client-sharing/) users could not view form submissions in CloudCannon by following the link from the form submission notification email, as CloudCannon would require them to log in with a CloudCannon account.
  * Now, when you create a new Inbox target, you can enable the *Use Client Sharing to view attached files* option. CloudCannon will ensure all form submission notification emails use a link to the Client Login Page.
  * Additionally, you can toggle this option for existing Inbox targets using the *File attachment settings* option in the Inbox *Context menu*.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where users with the `org:settings:details:write` permission could edit the Multi-Factor Authentication settings for an Organization. You must be a member of the Owners Permission Group to edit these settings.
* Fixed an issue where only members of the Owners Permission Group could see the Organization-level Flags settings. Users with the `org:settings:details:write` permission should be able to edit these flags.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, reCAPTCHA validation would pass incorrectly. CloudCannon will now forward form submissions that fail reCAPTCHA validation to the *Error* section of your *Inbox*.
