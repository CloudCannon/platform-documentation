* The Source Editor now has appropriate syntax highlighting and basic language features for the CloudCannon build hook files.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue causing files to be saved with the wrong path when uploaded from inside the Assets browser.
* Removed an unnecessary extra confirmation step when deleting DNS records.
* Fixed an issue preventing usage graphs from loading in some cases.
* Fixed an issue that required MFA/SSO login when cancelling a transfer request to an Organization that requires MFA/SSO login.
