The CloudCannon Legacy app is no longer available. Thank you to everyone who provided feedback during this process; we have addressed all issues brought to our attention. If you have any further feedback or questions, please don't hesitate to contact our friendly [support team](/support/).

This release addressed issues affecting the Visual Editor and permissions for adding Custom Domains.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, editing a file in the Visual Editor would break templating.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, CloudCannon would incorrectly prevent you from adding a Custom Domain to a Site when you had the correct permissions.
