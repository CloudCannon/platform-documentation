* The *Select file* button opens a dropdown with the *Upload a new file* and *Select existing file* options.
* When you select a file, CloudCannon will display a preview if it is an image, or metadata about the file otherwise.
* Added the `disable_upload_file`, `disable_direct_input`, `disable_upload_file_in_file_browser` configuration keys to File Inputs.

### Other Features & Improvements

* Added the `disable_add`, `disable_remove`, and `disable_reorder` configuration keys to Array Inputs.
* Updated the name of the *Preview live site here* option in the Editing Interface *Context Menu* to *Open output URL* for consistency with the *Copy output URL* option.
* Better messaging when CloudCannon cannot show a gallery image or screenshots on a File Card.
  * Red *Failed to load* text indicates that CloudCannon found an image but failed to load the image preview.
  * Gray *No preview available* indicates that CloudCannon could not find an image preview to load.
  * If you configure preview text, this will only appear in there is no icon or image, rather than while an image preview is loading.

## Fixes
