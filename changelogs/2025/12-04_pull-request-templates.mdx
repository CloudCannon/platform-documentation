title: Pull Request templates
---
This release added Pull Request templates, the new Lume logo, and minor improvements for the Source Editor.

It also addressed several issues, including those affecting files with `&` in the filename, branching inside of *Projects*, broken links, and incorrect error messages.

### Features & Improvements

* Added Pull Request templates, allowing you to configure default title and body content, customize the title and body inputs, and reference a file for more complex body content. Please read our latest documentation for more information:
  * [What is a Pull Request template?](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-pull-request-template/)
  * [Configure a Pull Request template](/documentation/articles/configure-a-pull-request-template/)
* Updated the in-app logo for [Lume](https://lume.land/).
* Performance improvements for the Source Editor.

### Fixes

* Fixed an issue where you could not open files with the `&` character in the filename.
* Fixed an issue where *Create a Site* button in the *Project Sites Browser* did not automatically copy the *Main Branch* when one was configured.
* Fixed a broken link for the *Configure* button on the *Setup instructions* modal under your *Subdomain* page.
