title: CloudCannon Site authentication option
---
This release added a new Site authentication option, the *Branch Defaults* page for Projects, and improved sorting options in the *DAM browser*.

It also addressed several issues, including those affecting `allow_custom_markup` behavior and screenshots.

## Features & Improvements

* Added the *CloudCannon* Site authentication option.
  * You can now add *CloudCannon* authentication to your Site, where visitors to your website can only view the content if they are logged in to CloudCannon and have the `site: read` permission for that Site.
* Added the *Branch Defaults* page under *Project Settings*.
  * You can now configure the default settings for new branches, such as what *Publish Mode* a new branch should use, whether CloudCannon should delete the Site after a successful merge, and if the branch Site has an authentication method.
* Better sorting options for the *DAM browser*.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where `allow_custom_markup: true` destroyed the content of elements with `class="cms-embed"`.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, screenshots were the wrong size.
