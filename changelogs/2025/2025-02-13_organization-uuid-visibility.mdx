title: Organization UUID visibility
---
This release added an Organization UUID to the *API Keys* page, better messaging during Site Syncing, and changed when the first Site backup occurred.

It also addressed several issues, including those affecting the *Live Site Preview* button and the CloudCannon Configuration File.

## Features & Improvements

* Added the Organization UUID and *Copy* button to the *API Keys* page under *Org Settings*.
  * The API feature is currently in private beta. For more information, please contact [our friendly support team](/support/).
* Better messaging when you first Sync your Site files.
* CloudCannon no longer creates a Site backup when you first create your Site, as no changes have been made to your files during Syncing.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the *Live Site Preview* button did not appear after your first successful build.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, you Internet browser tab would become unresponsive after opening the CloudCannon Configuration File.
