This release added better UI for discounts on the *Subscription* page and disabled the *Update Project* button while your repository loads.

It also addressed issues affecting Related Links on Projects and Bookshop in the Visual Editor.

## Features & Improvements

* Better UI and messaging on the *Subscription* page under *Org Settings* and the *Review your billing* page to reflect any subscription discounts applied to your Organization accurately.
* Disabled the *Update Project* button on the *Repository* section of *Project Settings* while CloudCannon is loading your repository details.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where updating your Project settings would delete your Project Related Links.
* Fixed an issue where Bookshop would fail to load if you clicked a link in the Visual Editor.
* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
