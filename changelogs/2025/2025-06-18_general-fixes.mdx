This release addressed issues affecting custom markup in Rich Text editors, previews of SVG files, and screenshots in the *Sites browser*.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where Sites with `allow_custom_markup: false` did not create uneditable snippets for links with non-standard attributes (e.g., `id`,  `data`) in Rich Text editors.
* Fixed an issue where previews for SVG files did not work.
* Fixed an issue where screenshots on the *Sites browser* were broken.
