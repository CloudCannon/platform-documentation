It also addressed issues affecting tables in the Content Editor, DAM previews on Client Sharing, and the Collection browser.

## Features & Improvements

* Better error messaging for misconfigured inputs.
* Better error messaging in the DAM browser, including error codes where applicable.
* Added support for Markdown attributes on Hugo Sites.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, inserting a new row in a table created a nested table.
* Fixed an issue where DAM previews did not load for Client Sharing users.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, the Collection browser would infinitely reload after committing a deleted file.
