This release fixed several issues, including those affecting the deletion of branched Sites and structures.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon did not initialize the "Delete this Site after publishing" setting for branched Sites.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, structures took precedence over the configured type for an input.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, structures clashed with the value of an input and caused CloudCannon to assign the wrong input type.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, CloudCannon loaded the incorrect input configuration when you added a structure to an empty array.
