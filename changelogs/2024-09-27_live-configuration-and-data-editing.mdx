title: Live configuration and data editing
---
This release added UI improvements to the *Status* and *Flags* pages,

It also released the live data and configuration editing feature and the Unified Configuration file format. Thank you to everyone who assisted in our September 2024 Live Configuration Beta. Your feedback is always valuable to our team.

&nbsp;

The new CloudCannon Site creation and onboarding experience is now the default for all new Organizations.

&nbsp;

The Legacy version of CloudCannon (which does not support live data and configuration editing or Unified Configuration) is still available for a short amount of time. CloudCannon will provide support for the Legacy app until October 31st, 2024. If you have any feedback about this change, please get in touch with our [support team](/support/) or contact us through your dedicated Slack channel.

* Groups within Structures are now configured using the `values.groups` key to avoid a common source of misconfiguration.
* CloudCannon will now warn you if you have a `/.gitattributes` file, but Git LFS is not enabled on the *Source Syncing* page in your *Site Settings*. This warning will appear in the new *Needs attention* section on the *Status* page.
* Added a *Clear* button, a loading spinner, and icons to Select and Multiselect inputs.
* Partner Organizations can select whether new Client Organizations use the Legacy app by default during Organization creation.
* Client Sharing users can control if they are in the Legacy environment using the *Enter Legacy* button in the *App Navigation* sidebar.
  * This button enables a Site-wide flag which affects all Client Sharing users.
  * Client Sharing users cannot open Sites using the Unified Configuration file format while in the Legacy app.
* The *Summary* tab on the *Status* page now has a *Needs attention* notice if CloudCannon detects an issue with your Site configuration, a *Suggestions* section, and a link to Support. The most recent Sync and Build are on the right of the page.
* The *Flags* page now has sections for *General*, *Upgrade to Unified Configuration*, *Input naming conventions*, and *Legacy options*.
  * Flag available under the *General* section include the *Disable setup prompts* flag.
  * Flag available under the *Upgrade to Unified Configuration* section include the *Enable live configuration and data reloading* and *Use Unified Configuration* flags. This section will not appear if your Site is already using the Unified Configuration file format.
  * Flag available under the *Input naming conventions* section include the *Infer Select values from input key* and *Infer Structure from input key* flags.
  * Flag available under the *Legacy options* section include the *Image size attributes default behavior* and *Legacy collections value key* flags.
* &nbsp;Better messaging when discarding unsaved changes.

### Live data and configuration editing

* You can now see your updates affect CloudCannon live whenever you edit your data and configuration files without waiting for a build.
* When you create a new file in a Collection, Select inputs populated by that Collection will display to new file before you save it.
* When you update Input, Structure, or Schema configuration, you can see those changes the next time you open a file in an editing interface.
  * CloudCannon applies a Schema to a file when first opened during an editing session. You will not see live changes from an updated Schema if a file is already open with unsaved changes.

Live data and configuration editing is available by default on all Sites with the Unified Configuration file format.

You can enable live data and configuration editing on your existing Sites using the *Enable live configuration and data reloading* flag on the *Flags* page.
