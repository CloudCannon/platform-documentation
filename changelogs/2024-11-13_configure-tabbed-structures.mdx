title: Configure tabbed structures
---
This release added the `values.tabbed` key for Structures in Unified Configuration.

It also addressed an issue where permissions incorrectly prevented you from reading the CloudCannon configuration file.

## Features & Improvements

* Added the `values.tabbed` key to Structures. This key allows you to create tabs if you have two layers of nested objects within your Structure. CloudCannon would does this automatically for Non-unified Configuration Sites, but it must be explicitly configured in the [Unified Configuration](/documentation/guides/unified-configuration-migration-guide/) file format.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where you could not see the Collections in your *Site Navigation* if you were a member of a Permission Group with all permissions scoped to a single Project.
