This release provides increased support for static sites built with Nuxt, marking the end of our beta. Try <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://app.cloudcannon.com/register#sites/connect/github/CloudCannon/sendit-nuxtjs-template">our Sendit template</a>, and our [starter guide for Nuxt](/documentation/guides/nuxtjs-starter-guide/).

**Features:**

* Added a confirmation step and a progress indicator when uploading assets through the DAM browser.
* Invoices can now be previewed on a web page, rather than downloading a PDF.

**Fixes:**

* The `remove_empty_inputs` option now also removes empty arrays.
