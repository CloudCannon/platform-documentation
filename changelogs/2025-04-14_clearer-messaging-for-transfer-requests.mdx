title: Clearer messaging for Transfer Requests
---
This release improved the messaging around Transfer Requests, including what information CloudCannon includes, and added `.` character stripping from subdomains.

## Features & Improvements

* Added better messaging for Transfer Requests, such as indicating which additional resources CloudCannon will also include in the transfer (i.e., Sites, Domains, Inboxes, or DAMs) are connected to the resource you selected.
* Transfer Requests now include the Site name, and any connected Domain, Inbox, or DAM names.
* CloudCannon now strips any `.` characters from the subdomain field when you configure a new subdomain.
* If you are a member of the [CloudCannon Partner Program](/partner-program/), you can now earn extra points based on your [pricing plan](/pricing/) and the number of additional seats you pay for (including users and client sharing).

## Fixes

* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
