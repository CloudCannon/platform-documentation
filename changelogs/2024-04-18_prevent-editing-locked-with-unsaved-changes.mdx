title: Prevent editing locked with unsaved changes
type: minor
---
This release added new behavior for enabling Editing Locked on sites with unsaved changes, checks for Projects, and support for one sentence per line formatting in Markdown files.

It also addressed an issue affecting dropdown menus from the *WYSIWYG toolbar* in rich text inputs.

### Features & Improvements:

* CloudCannon will now prevent you from turning on Editing Locked if your site has unsaved changes.
* Added checks to ensure one Project per git repository per Organization.
* Added support for one sentence per line formatting for Markdown files. The key `sentence_per_line` defaults to false.

### Fixes:

* Fixed an issue causing the bounds of rich text inputs to cut off dropdown menus from the *WYSIWYG toolbar*. When space is limited in a rich text input, dropdown menus will become scrollable.
