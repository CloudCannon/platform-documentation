title: Cloudflare Turnstile support
---
This release added support for Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA,

It also addressed several issues, including those affecting draft files on Jekyll Sites, Cards in the Structures and Snippets modals, cloning file behavior, disabling file actions, and the *Asset browser*.

## Features & Improvements

* Added support for [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/products/turnstile/) CAPTCHA on CloudCannon forms.
* For Sites using [Live Data and Configuration Editing](/documentation/guides/unified-configuration-migration-guide/), you can now see new Schemas in your *Collection browser* *\+Add* button dropdown before saving the Schema
* Added the `file_config`, `_snippets_imports`, `_snippets`, and `commit_templates` keys to the CloudCannon configuration file when you open it in the Data Editor.
* Improved accessibility on the *Add a new Site* page by adding keyboard controls when you choose whether to use a template or your own files, and when uploading files for a new Site from your computer.
* Better error messaging when setting up an existing CloudCannon account with SAML.
* Better error messaging when you reference a Schema that does not exist.
* Better error handling when you make a duplicate Pull Request.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where publishing a draft file on a Jekyll Site would not prompt you to rename the file with a date.
* Fixed an issue where Cards in the Structures and Snippets modals did not use Gallery view by default, despite having images configured.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, after you cloned a file CloudCannon would incorrectly open a separate file.
* Fixed an issue where a blank file would persist in your *Collection browser* when you created a new file with an incorrect Schema name.
* Fixed an issue where disabling file actions in a Collection would not disable the *Delete* option.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon did not use the name of a Collection as the tab title in your internet browser.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, the *Asset browser* would attempt to use a broken external URL as the folder path.
* Fixed an issue where clicking the *Cancel* button after you drag and drop files into the *File browser* did not close the upload modal.
* Fixed an issue where, if you had permission to Read the *Source Syncing* page under *Site Settings* and the *Subscription* page under *Org Settings*, CloudCannon would allow you to click buttons and produce a permission error, rather than displaying a Read-only page.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon would reorder the values for Select and Multiselect inputs rather than respecting the order in your input configuration.
