title: SSL certificate improvements
type: minor
---
This release included several updates for SSL certificates, such as how often CloudCannon checks your domain name, emailing you when a certificate fails to renew, and updates to the UI on the *Custom Domains* page. It also added better error messaging, support for a context field and multi-line comments on inputs, and more accessible colors.

This release addressed several issues, including those affecting HTML inputs, external link previews, spacing in the UI, Site merging, and the Pull Request description box.

## Features & Improvements

* Updated the way CloudCannon generates SSL certificates. Rather than checking your domain name is pointing at CloudCannon every 20 minutes, CloudCannon will now use an exponential back-off model.
* CloudCannon will now email all team members with permission to read the Settings details for a Base Domain when an SSL certificate fails to renew.
* Updated the UI for the *Custom Domains* page under *Site Settings*.
  * Added a new tab structure.
  * Updated the select box to choose a custom certificate.
  * The *Custom Domains* page will no longer say your Site is insecure if the certificate is loading or fails to load.
* Added the new context option for all inputs to provide context or extra instructions for team members using inputs. You can now define `context.open`, `context.title`, `context.icon`, and `context.content` for each input.
* Added the `show_count` option to configure a character counter for text area inputs.
* Added support for multi-line comments on inputs.
* Added the option to specify Hugo, Ruby, node, and deno version numbers in the *Environment Options* on the *Build Configuration* page under *Site Settings*.
* Added the Project name to the *Target* dropdown when creating a permission with the Project scope.
* Improved the clarity of error messages when you attempt to delete a Site with a custom domain before removing Sites connected to subpaths of that domain.
* Improved the clarity of error messages when you attempt to use DAM files without the correct permissions.
* Improved the appearance of long text on Choice and Multichoice inputs.
* Improved the performance of the *Projects* page to load Sites faster.
* Updated the Nimbus gray color used in the app to pass accessibility contrast tests at WCAG AA level.
* You can now use a CloudCannon global configuration file with Sites using Static SSG.
