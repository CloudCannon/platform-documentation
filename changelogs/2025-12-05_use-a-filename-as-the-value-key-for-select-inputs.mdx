title: Use a filename as the value_key for Select Inputs
---
This release added new values for `value_key` in Select Inputs, better copy for in-app guides, *Status* and *Guide Progress* tooltips, and improved clarity for error and activity messaging and the *Bandwidth Usage* table.

It also addressed several issues, including those affecting the in-app guides, broken links, Rich Text Inputs, file titles, and UI appearance.

## Features & Improvements

* You can now use `value_key: filename` and `value_key: filename_without_ext` to populate a Select Input with the filename from a file on your *Site*. Here is an example Input configuration:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````
_inputs:
  related_articles:
    type: multiselect
    options:
      values: collections.articles
      value_key: filename_without_ext

``````````
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

* Better copy for the *Getting Started with Editing* in-app guide.
* The *Set up Visual Editing* in-app guide now tells you which *Collections* are using an automatically detected URL, an explicitly configured URL, or have URL disabled.
* Improved the clarity of URLs in the *Bandwidth* table under the *Usage* tab on your *Site Dashboard* by removing the domain name.
* Added a tooltip to the *Status* and *Guide Progress* indicators next to *Dashboard* in your *Site Navigation*.
* Better error messaging for the *Invalid global paths* warning on your *Site Dashboard*.
* Better copy for *Cards* under the *Activity* tab on your *Site Dashboard* to provide more context when you update your *Site* settings.

## Fixes

* Fixed a broken link for the *Syncs* tab on your *Site Dashboard*.
* Removed the *Complete the Guide: Getting Started with Editing* from the *Host your website on the Internet* in-app guide, as web hosting does not require you to have configured WYSIWYG editing.
* Fixed an issue where the *Skip Tour* button was still visible after a task was completed in the *Getting Started with Editing* in-app guide.
* Fixed an issue where Rich Text Inputs were not resizable by default.
* Fixed an issue where, when updating the title of a file, the title in the *Collection Browser*, *Editing Interface Header*, and *Save changes* modal did not immediately update.
* Fixed spacing issues and UI appearance across the app.
