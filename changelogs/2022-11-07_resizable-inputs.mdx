This release provides a number of useful options for controlling the size of some of our larger inputs in the Data Editor. We also now allow JPEG profile images and have a nicer title-to-filename mapping.

**Features:**

* Resize options for [Rich Text](/documentation/articles/configure-your-rich-text-inputs/) inputs.
* Resize options for [Code](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-code-input/) inputs.
* Allow JPEG profile images.
* Improve slugify behavior for new filenames.
* Improved initialization of new Hugo shortcodes in the Content Editor.
* Added Hugo snippet templates for shortcodes with no arguments.

**Fixes:**

* Fixed a bug with escaped characters in Hugo shortcode parameters
