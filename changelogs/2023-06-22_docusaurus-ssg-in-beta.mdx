Support for Docusaurus is now in beta.

**Features:**

* Docusaurus SSG support is now in beta.
* You can now set a maximum size limit for files uploaded to your DAM.
* New sites will no longer add width and height attributes to rich text images by default. This behavior is configurable with the `image_size_attributes` option.
* You can now opt into, and out of, legacy behavior in the Flags section of your site settings.
* File inputs now show a loading state while uploading files to a DAM.
* You can now customize the name of files uploaded to your site files or DAM.
* You can now configure which DAMs are available for different inputs across your site.

**Fixes:**

* The Content Editor now loads faster for files with multiple unconfigured snippets.
* Patched security vulnerabilities.
* Fixed an issue where the Transfer Requests menu could fail to load if you had an Azure DAM attached to the site.
* Added some extra error handling to file inputs.
