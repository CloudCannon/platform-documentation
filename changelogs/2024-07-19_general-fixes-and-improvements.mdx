This release addressed several issues, including load times and UX when uploading files in the DAM browser, signalling the maximum length of custom domain names, and backups failing for very large sites.

## Features & Improvements

* When uploading a new file in the DAM browser, the new file will now initially appear at the top of the file list, and loading time may be slightly reduced.
* Added a character counter to the form for adding a new custom domain, to properly signal the maximum limit of 62 characters.

## Fixes

* Fixed an incorrect permissions error occurring when triggering a build deploy in some cases.
* Fixed site backups failing for sites over 5 GBs.
* Inline snippets now display correctly inside headings.
* Fixed a bug which prevented Azure assets being selected when no container is configured in the Organization DAM settings.
* Fixed a bug where DAM files could be overwritten without warning in some cases when uploading a new file.
* Options for removing a user from an Organization are now correctly hidden if that user has implicit access in virtue of being a Partner.
