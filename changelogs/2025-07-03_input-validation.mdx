title: Input validation
---
Thank you to everyone who provided feedback on our [CloudCannon Community post](https://community.cloudcannon.com/t/upcoming-input-validation-feature/235). We love collaborating with you on our features.

&nbsp;

This release updated the Lite plan to include email form targets, and added pagination when listing DNS records.

It also addressed several issues affecting add-on warning emails, stripping markup in the Content Editor, billing information, and filters in the *Domains browser*.

## Features and Improvements

### Input validation

* Added input validation for all input types in the Data, Content, and Visual Editor.
* When you configure input validation for an input, CloudCannon will require the input value to meet predefined criteria before you can save your changes. If the value of the input is invalid, CloudCannon will provide and error message with directions on how to fix it.

* x
* Depending on the input type, can now configure the following keys under `options`:
  * `required`: require a value
  * `max_file_size`: limit uploaded files by file size
  * `max_items`, `min_items`: specify to number of items allowed in an Array, Muliselect, or Multichoice input
  * `max_length`, `min_length`: specify the number of text characters allowed
  * `start_from`, `end_before`: specify the allowed range for a Date or Datetime input
  * `pattern`:
  * `unique_on`:
* The existing Number input configuration keys `max` and `min` will now validate you input value.
* CloudCannon has default error messages for when a value does not meet validation criteria. You can customize the error message for all input validation configuration keys using the matching message key under `options`: `required_message`, `max_message`, `min_message`, `max_file_size_message`, `max_items_message`, `min_items_message`, `max-length-message`, `min_length_message`, `start_from_message`, `end_before_message`, `pattern_message`, `unique_on_message`.
