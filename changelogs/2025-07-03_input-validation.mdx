This release updated the Lite plan to include email form targets, and added pagination when listing DNS records.

It also addressed several issues affecting add-on warning emails, stripping markup in the Content Editor, billing information, and filters in the *Domains browser*.

  * The existing keys
  * For more information, please see our documentation on inputs in general or
