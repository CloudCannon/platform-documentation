title: DAM browser for Cloudinary
type: minor
---
Cloudinary assets can now be previewed using the CloudCannon browser, instead of the Cloudinary widget. You can toggle this behaviour in your organisation's DAM settings. Read more about this option [in our documentation](/documentation/articles/creating-a-cloudinary-dam/#link-cloudinary-to-your-site).

**Features:**

* Added an option to toggle whether to use the Cloudinary widget when using a Cloudinary DAM.
* You can now set the `--incremental` flag for sites using Eleventy.
* Added more details to the warning message when add-ons are disabled on a subscription.
* New Hugo sites now preserve `node_modules/`, `hugo_cache/`, and `resources/` paths by default.

**Fixes:**

* Fixed an issue where some new sites were incorrectly assumed to use Hugo.
* Fixed a small UI issue on the Hosting Setup dropdown.
* Fixed an issue where the Visual Editor could show a "Building" loading message while the site was building locked.
* Selected text is now more visible in the editor.
* Fixed an issue where snippets could not be edited on a page with no front matter.
* Fixed an issue where sites could fail to build when using the `jekyll-feed` gem.
* Added handling to prevent builds failing in cases where version information cannot be found.
* Fixed issue with `allow_create` option for multiselects not working accordingly to config.
* Fixed an issue that could sometimes occur when saving a file.
* Reduced the wait time for builds while editing, by prioritizing those builds over triggered rebuilds.
