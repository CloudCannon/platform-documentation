**Features:**

* Support for Nuxt static sites is out of beta.
* Added a confirmation step and a progress indicator when uploading assets through the DAM browser.
* Invoices can now be previewed on a web page, rather than downloading a PDF.

**Fixes:**

* The `remove_empty_inputs` option now also removes empty arrays.
