Our new Beta, Editing in CloudCannon, is now available to [Partners](https://cloudcannon.com/partner-program/) and customers on an Enterprise plan.

Editing in CloudCannon is now a collaborative experience, enabling your teams to create content together. We've improved how our editing interfaces look and function, how you review your team's changes before saving, and added badges to file cards to indicate changed files. We've also introduced avatars to various places in the app so you can see who is editing in real-time.

For more information about our latest Beta, check out the [Beta Documentation](/documentation/articles/beta).

This release also updated CloudCannon's dependencies.

### Fixes:

* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
