This release includes a number of fixes and quality-of-life improvements.

**Features:**

* You can now hover over your site name and branch, to see the full text in cases where it is otherwise too long to see.
* Clarified source syncing behaviour by adding extra explanatory text in the settings.
* The site status icon will now show an hourglass icon while the site is waiting for a build to state.

**Fixes:**

* The "Download Backup" button no longer unnecessarily warns you about losing unsaved changes.
* Fixed a UI issue preventing the documentation for organisation setup from staying open in the app.
