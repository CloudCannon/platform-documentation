title: Revised Build Status
type: minor
---

This release contains an update to the way we present the build status of your sites. We've moved the status away from the editor controls and reordered the **Status** section. Other general fixes are also included.

**Features:**

* Build status revised
* Filter for team members now includes email address

**Fixes:**

* `source` elements no longer aggressively filtered in embeds
* Resolved an edge case where editor could get stuck in a loading state
* Front matter and YAML editors with a single top level object key are no longer auto expanded
* Editing with `_hide_content: true` prefixes the date if set or undefined for newly created posts
