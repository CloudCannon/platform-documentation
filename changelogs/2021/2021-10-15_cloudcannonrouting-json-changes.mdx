title: .cloudcannon/routing.json changes
type: minor

This release corrects the redirects that are defined in .cloudcannon/routing.json. These routes now take priority over the file based routes that exist automatically. Routes defined in 301.txt will use the old functionality. Use the [forced option](/documentation/articles/configuring-custom-routing/#redirects) to toggle this off.

**Fixes:**

* .cloudcannon/routing.json take priority over file based routes
* [Officially deprecated 301.txt](/documentation/articles/deprecated-301-redirects/)
