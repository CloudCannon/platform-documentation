This release introduces new dashboards for your organisations and sites. Each site has its own dashboard showing build time and bandwidth for the month. Your organisation home screen will now show build time and bandwidth across all your sites, along with some handy links for managing your org. CloudCannon on mobile is now slightly easier to navigate. Also included are a variety of minor fixes.

**Features:**

* New home dashboard for each organisation.
* New usage dashboards for each site. These can be found in the *Dashboard* section in your site's sidebar
* Optimized uncached hosting performance

**Fixes:**

* More descriptive error messages for merge conflicts when publishing a site
* More descriptive error messages when trying to make changes to a site with editing disabled
* Signing in will now remember the URL you were navigating to
* Fixed an issue with loading site data on some pages
