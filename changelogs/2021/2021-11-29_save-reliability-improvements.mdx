This release resolves issues with failed saves. We have restructured the logic for saving files in the content and visual editors. This should be more reliable and recover from failed saves better.

**Features:**

* Save progress shown during Uploading Changes step
* Hugo updated to 0.89.4
* Added support for `Node.js 16.x` and made `Node.js 16.x `and `npm 8.x` the default versions. To stay on `Node.js 14.x` you can add a `.nvmrc` file to the site and run `nvm use` (or simply run `nvm use 14`) in the [build hooks](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#usage)

**Fixes:**

* Better save and save-failure logic
* Default content files with editor types are preferred
* Fixed issue with the build process not copying files starting with a dot
* Fixed issue setting global `_inputs` settings for Hugo
