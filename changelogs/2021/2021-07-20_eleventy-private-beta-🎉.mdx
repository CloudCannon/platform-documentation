title: Eleventy private beta ðŸŽ‰
type: major

Included in this release are a number of features that give you even more control over your workflow in CloudCannon. This includes new build hooks, increased support for collection-level configuration, and CloudCannon instance values.

We've also included a number of bug fixes.

**Features:**

* Support for 11ty is now in private beta. Contact support if you would like to take part.
* Added new [pre-install, pre-build and post-build hooks](/documentation/build/hooks/#hooks). These can be used to run shell scripts at the specified point in the process.
* We have reworked [collection-level configuration](/documentation/edit/interfaces/explore/#collections). This decouples the feature from Jekyll, allowing use on Hugo and 11ty sites.
* New [CloudCannon instance values](/documentation/edit/editing/configuration/#instance-values). These can be used to uniquely identify newly created files from collection defaults, and items from array structures.
* Improved the format of the build info used to generate the ui components in the app.

**Fixes:**

* Hugo sites will now correctly append uploadsDir to the static directory
* Fixed a bug with the color picker in the data editor
* Fixed a case where failed build-output would be obscured by a command preview.
* Fixed an issue with our legacy build compiler
