This release adds features to improve caching between builds, as well as general platform bug fixes. This release also improves on the Hugo private beta.

**Features:**

* Added a new build config for preserved paths, allowing for caching of custom directories such as node\_modules. See our new [documentation on caching](/documentation/build/setup/caching/)
* Added [Ruby 3.0 support](/documentation/build/setup/ruby-versions/#ruby-versions)
* Upgraded the default Node.js version to the current LTS. Tailwind builds will now work.
* Added [NVM support](/documentation/build/setup/node-versions/) to define a custom node version

**Fixes:**

* Fixed timezone behavior in CloudCannon builds. Timezones specified in your Jekyll configuration will now be honored and date filters will not convert to UTC
* Fixed an issue where merge conflicts would sometimes be shown to editors as a generic server error
* Fixed select boxes appending collection items with a custom collection directory
* Fixed an issue where hidden files and collection defaults had options for publishing
* Fixed missing padding in the [Array Structures](/documentation/edit/editing/configuration/#array-structures) modal
* Fixed build options in site settings showing as a single dash
* Fixed an issue where adding new items in the middle of an array creates duplicates rather than empty items
* Fixed \`mailto:\` links in the data editor previewing as a URL
* Fixed SVGs not displaying when uploaded through organization branding. Broken images will display correctly if re-uploaded
* Fixed an issue with invoice download

**Hugo beta updates:**

* Bumped Hugo version to 0.82.0-extended
* Added support for [using output data](/documentation/build/setup/#including-data-in-output) in Hugo to populate select boxes
* Added support for editing blog posts in Hugo using the visual editor
* Fixed image uploads in CloudCannon prepending the Hugo static directory
* Fixed the [default editor path option](/documentation/edit/editing/html/#default-editor-path) in Hugo
* Fixed image uploads in the Hugo visual or content editor producing incorrect output
