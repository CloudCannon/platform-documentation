title: Disabling TLS1.0 and TLS1.1
type: major
---
This release disables the TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.0 protocols on CloudCannon hosting, following all major browsers dropping support for viewing websites served exclusively through TLS versions below 1.2.

This change helps websites hosted on CloudCannon meet PCI requirements and have a more secure presence online.

**Changes:**

* TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.0 have been disabled on CloudCannon hosting.
