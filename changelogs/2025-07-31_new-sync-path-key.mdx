title: New sync path key
---
This release added the `CLOUDCANNON_SYNC_PATHS` configuration key.

It also addressed several issues, including those affecting Image inputs, syncs and merges for larger Sites, the Visual Editor, and uploading to Azure DAMs.

## Features & Improvements

* Added the `CLOUDCANNON_SYNC_PATHS` configuration key, which allows you to delete files from your Git repository.
* The `SYNC_PATHS` configuration key is now deprecated, due to the name being too common

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where uploading an image using an Image input did not respect Site `source`.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon would fail to sync large Sites.
* Fixed an issue where large merges would sporadically fail.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, opening a file in the Visual Editor would show the incorrect page.
* Fixed an issue where uploading to an Azure DAM would cause a CORS error.
