This release addressed several issues, including those affecting the *Save changes* modal, inboxes targeting Make, Base Domain permissions, and Trial Organizations.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, CloudCannon would open multiple copies of the *Save changes* modal.
* Fixed an issue where the *Update a Domain* button on the *Domain Settings* tab was not disabled for users without the `base-domain:settings:dns:write` permission.
* Fixed an issue where, for some inboxes targeting a Make form hook, CloudCannon would incorrectly mark messages as *Sent* when they failed to send.
* Fixed an issue where you could not confirm the billing increase associated with accepting a Transfer Request with a Domain while using an Organization on a Trial.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, navigating between pages under *Site Settings* would incorrectly trigger a "Loading DAMs..." notification that did not clear.
* Fixed an issue where the *Unlink Form* button would incorrectly reload the page.
