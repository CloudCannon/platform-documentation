This release addressed several issues, including configured preview options not falling back correctly, some graphing options not working correctly, and sorting preferences not persisting between sessions.

## Fixes

* Sorting preferences now persist when you leave CloudCannon and come back.
* Fixed view options on Site bandwidth and build time graphs.
* Preview options now correctly fall back to the next value when they evaluate to an empty string.
