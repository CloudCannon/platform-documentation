title: Navigation and Editor Improvements
type: major
---

This release improves the navigation flow when editing your sites. The editor is now split screen if your screen is wide enough, and also toggle-able to full screen. The editor itself now queues up file uploads, so changes to a file and any attached images are saved at the same time, in the same commit.

**Features:**

* Improved navigation breadcrumb
* Split screen editor
* Batched file uploads with save in *Visual* and *Content* editors
* Code blocks and embeds are now supported in Rich Text front matter fields
* Rich Text front matter fields are now taller
* Environment variables fields now wider with visible-on-click style

**Fixes:**

* File count for folders in *Explore* now account for hidden files
* Folders only containing a *Collection Defaults* file are now displayed in the *Explore* section
* Fixed issue creating files in new folders without *Collection Defaults* file
