title: Hugo Shortcodes support 🎉
type: major
---
This release adds much-requested support for [Hugo shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes) in the Content Editor! And boy, we are excited to get this feature out.

CloudCannon automatically supports all built-in Hugo shortcodes. Over the coming months we’ll start to reveal more of the bigger picture for our Snippets feature, which will include full support and integration for shortcode equivalents in other static site generators (like Liquid tags in Jekyll and Eleventy), as well as full MDX support. Read the [full Hugo shortcode release post in our blog](https://cloudcannon.com/blog/editing-content-with-hugo-shortcodes/).

**Features:**

* Added support for [Hugo shortcodes with Snippets](/documentation/articles/snippets-using-hugo-shortcodes/)
* [Updated structures to use the new `preview` options](/documentation/articles/configure-your-card-previews/)
