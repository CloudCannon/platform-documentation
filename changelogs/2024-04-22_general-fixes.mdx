This release addressed issues related to errors preventing you from saving your file and lost edits when making changes immediately after saving a file.

### Fixes:

* Fixed an issue where download errors while editing a file would prevent CloudCannon from saving further edits.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, editing a file immediately after saving changes would cause a "Syncing" screen to appear, and CloudCannon would not persist the most recent edits.
