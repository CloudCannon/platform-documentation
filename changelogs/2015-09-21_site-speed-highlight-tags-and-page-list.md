title: "Site Speed, Highlight tags in markdown editor and pages list"
type: major
---

A DOS attack early last week forced us to review page performance. The improvements made are:

* Improved caching of the sites to get a ~5 times improvement in load speeds.
* Applied rate limiting to a site to prevent malicious attacks on all sites.
* Blocked common attack vectors for a Wordpress/php site to reduce load on servers.
* Blocked pinging services that clog your google analytics. These flooded referrer stats to gain backlinks.
* Compression on sites are now performed immediately after a Jekyll compile.


**Features:**

* Added support for highlight tag in markdown editor. This retains the content like a pre tag.
* Users will need to downgrade before deleting their account to stop accidental deletions
* New pages list in the *Explore* section. This allows clients to navigate and clone pages
* Added support for category posts folders. Each category is listed in the *Explore* section. For example, posts in `/cats/_posts` are separated from those inside `/_posts`. All drafts remain in `/_drafts/`, upon publishing the category decides where they should go. No change will occur if you have all posts in `/_posts`.


**Fixes:**

* Safari client editor failed to login on first use
* Client editor move/delete files were not working for some users
* WebSocket connection fixed for firefox windows
* Auth routes broke in some cases
* General bug fixes and tweeks
