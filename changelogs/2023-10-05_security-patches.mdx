This release removed the option to use CloudCannon Legacy and reduced the number of conditions that trigger a build. It also addressed security vulnerabilities and minor spacing issues affecting the Partner Program rewards dashboard.

**Features:**

* The option to use CloudCannon Legacy is no longer available. A new Beta is coming soon - thank you for your feedback!
* Git syncs that only impact the `.git` folder will no longer trigger builds unless used within the build.

**Fixes:**

* Fixed minor spacing issues in the Partner Program rewards page.
* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
