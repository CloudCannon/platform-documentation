title: New template filters
---
This release added several new features, including the `strip_leading_date` and `substring` filters for template strings, the *Do not grant new permissions on Site branch* checkbox for Projects, minor UI improvements for URL inputs, and moving the role questionnaire during onboarding.

## Features & Improvements

* Added the `strip_leading_date` and `substring` filters for template strings.
  * The `strip_leading_date` filter removes three numbers up to four characters long and separated by hyphens, underscores, or commas from the front of a string (e.g., `03-07-1999`, `2022_31_12`, `18,04,1700`, etc.).
  * The `substring` filter allows you to specify a start and end character from a string to use (e.g., `[slug|substring=5,9]`). If no end character is specified, the substring will include all characters until the end of the string.
* Added the *Do not grant new permissions on Site branch* checkbox to the *Branch defaults* section of the *Project Settings* page. This checkbox prevents CloudCannon from adding extra permissions (e.g., `site:publish:merge:write`) to a Custom Permission Group when you create a branched Site.
* Minor UI improvements for URL inputs linking to telephone numbers.
* Moved the main role questionnaire during sign-up to the account details screen.
