title: New pricing plans and Git LFS
type: minor
---
Today we're launching an updated range of pricing plans. Existing users will keep their current plans, but will be able to switch to the new plans if they choose.

**New pricing plan structure:**

* A free Personal plan with a single user and pay-as-you-grow build time and bandwidth.
* A new Standard plan as the ideal starting point for all teams.
* The Team plan with features for advanced teams.

**Note:** If you change to one of the new plans, you will **not** be able to switch back to your old plan.

##Git LFS and fixes

We've added Git Large File Storage (LFS) support and included fixes for several build-related bugs.

**Features:**

* New pricing plans: Personal, Standard, and Team
* Support for Git LFS, available on the [Team, Business, and Agency plan](https://cloudcannon.com/pricing/)

**Fixes:**

* Alpine.js builds should now work without breaking
* Compressor will no longer rewrite external URLs
* Fixed an issue when parsing whitespace in the front matter
