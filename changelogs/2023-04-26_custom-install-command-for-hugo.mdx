title: Custom install command for Hugo
type: minor
---
You can now configure a custom install command for Hugo sites, in case you use a package manager other than npm, for example. This release also includes several other fixes and improvements.

**Fixes:**

* The working directory is now reset after a custom build command, for consistency with other build hooks.
* Prevent builds crashing when the output directory has been configured with leading or trailing whitespace.
* Patched some security vulnerabilities.
* Deleting nested snippets no longer invalidates the parent snippet.
* Avoid request timeouts when opening a Cloudinary DAM in the CloudCannon asset browser.
