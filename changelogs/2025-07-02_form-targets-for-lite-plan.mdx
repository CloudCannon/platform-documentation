title: Form targets for Lite Plans
---
This release updated the Lite plan to include email form targets, and added pagination when listing DNS records.

It also addressed several issues affecting add-on warning emails, stripping markup in the Content Editor, billing information, and filters in the *Domains browser*.

## Features and Improvements

* Organizations on the Lite plan can now add email targets to forms.
* DNS records are now paginated in the Domain settings.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where items were occasionally missed in the billing breakdown on the *Subscription* page for complicated invoices.
* Fixed an issue where warning emails about monthly bandwidth and build-time usage were not sent correctly.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon did not strip unexppected class names from pasted text in the Content Editor.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, users on a CloudCannon trial would see an incorrect billing number on the *Subscription* page.
* Fixed incorrect text in the *Domains browser* filter options.
