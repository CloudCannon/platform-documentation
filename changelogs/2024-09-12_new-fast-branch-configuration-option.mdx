This release added the option to opt out of Fast Branch.

It also addressed several issues, including those affecting the DAM browser, collections in Eleventy Sites, Multiselect inputs, and tables in the Content Editor.

## Features & Improvements

* Added the option to opt out of “copy build files” stage of Fast Branch. This option is on the *Source Syncing* page under *Site Settings*.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, the DAM browser would deliver different results based on prior search terms.
* Fixed an issue where the DAM browser would not fetch your files after you cleared a search term from the search bar.
* Fixed an issue where, on some Eleventy Sites, CloudCannon could not automatically detect collection items if you formatted your source path incorrectly.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon would delete empty Multiselect inputs.
* Fixed an issue where navigating a table in the Content Editor with the keyboard arrow keys produced unexpected behavior.
* Fixed an issue causing your internet browser to freeze when you open the Content Editor.
* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
