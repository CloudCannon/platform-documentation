This release adds two features for customising the editing experience for your team. We have expanded our editor links feature by allowing links to page variables. We have replaced the GitHub merging interface in the site settings with an editor friendly publish workflow. Developers can select a target branch which Editors can publish their changes to using a new publish interface.

**Features:**

* [Front matter editor links](/documentation/edit/editing/configuration/)
* [GitHub publish interface](/documentation/sync/publishing/)
