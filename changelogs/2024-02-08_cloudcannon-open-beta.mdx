Our new Beta, Editing in CloudCannon, is now available to everyone!

The Open Beta introduces a brand new way to edit your files in CloudCannon, creating a collaborative experience where multiple users can create content together. We've improved how our editing interfaces look and function, how you review your team's changes before saving, and we’ve also introduced avatars to various places within the app, so you can see who is editing what, in real time.

We’d like to invite everyone to test our new upgrades before the full launch. Taking part in this Beta is a great chance to let us know what’s working for you, and what could be improved for you and your team before we launch.

To enter the Open Beta, click on the *Try the Editor Beta* button in the bottom left of the app, or click on your avatar and select *Enter CloudCannon Beta* from the *Account Menu*.
