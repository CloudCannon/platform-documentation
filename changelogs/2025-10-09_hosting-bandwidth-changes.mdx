title: Hosting bandwidth changes
---
This release increased hosting bandwidth on Standard and Team, lowered the price of bandwidth overages, and added length filters for template strings.

It also addressed issues affecting filtering form submissions and the `slugify` template string filter.

## Features & Improvements

* Increased the amount of hosting bandwidth included in your CloudCannon subscription from 75 GB to 110 GB for the Standard plan, and from 300 GB to 700 GB for the Team plan.
* Reduced the price of bandwidth overages from $20 USD per 100 GB to $15 USD per 100 GB for all current CloudCannon [pricing plans](/pricing/).
* Added length filters for template strings.
  * `{string|string_length}` returns the length of the string.
  * `{array|string_length}` returns the length of each string in the array.
  * `{array|array_length}` returns the length of the array.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where filtering errored form submissions did not work when you navigated beyond the first page of results.
* Fixed an issue where the `slugify` filter did not strip the `â‚¬` character.
