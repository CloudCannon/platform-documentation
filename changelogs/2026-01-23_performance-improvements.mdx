This release improved the loading time of the *Projects Browser* and added better UI for *Site Transfers*.

It also addressed several issues, including automatically assigning *Sites* to *Projects* and incorrect CloudCannon DNS zones.

## Features & Improvements

* The *Projects Browser* loads more quickly, particularly for *Projects* with many *Sites*.
* Added better UI and messaging for *Site* transfers, such as:
  * Paginating transfer requests.
  * More details about the *Organization* transferring the *Site* to you.
  * Better copy for *SSL Certificate* lists.
  * A warning message when a *Transfer Request* will increase your billing due to *Site Sharing* or *Client Sharing*.
* Improved the process of setting up a domain on CloudCannon DNS.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, CloudCannon did not automatically assign new *Sites* to the appropriate *Project*.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, CloudCannon would incorrectly configure the DNS zone for a *Custom Domain*.
* This addresses an issue where some zones were defaulting to "Flexible" encryption mode during onboarding, causing TLS 1.0/1.1 to be allowed.
* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
