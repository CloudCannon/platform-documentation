This release improved the loading time of the *Projects Browser*, added more sorting options for the *Projects Browser*, added a better UI for Site Transfers, and added a warning when cancelling your CloudCannon subscription.

It also addressed several issues, including automatically assigning *Sites* to *Projects*, incorrect CloudCannon DNS zones, *Input* configuration, *Inboxes*, *Schema* parsing, and more.

## Features & Improvements

* The *Projects Browser* loads more quickly, particularly for *Projects* with many *Sites*.
* Added the option to sort the *Projects Browser* by recently built.
* Added better UI and messaging for *Site* transfers, such as:
  * Paginating transfer requests.
  * More details about the *Organization* transferring the *Site* to you.
  * Better copy for *SSL Certificate* lists.
  * A warning message when a *Transfer Request* will increase your billing due to *Site Sharing* or *Client Sharing*.
* Added a warning about your live websites going down before you cancel your CloudCannon subscription.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, CloudCannon did not automatically assign new *Sites* to the appropriate *Project*.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, CloudCannon would incorrectly configure the DNS zone for a *Custom Domain*.
