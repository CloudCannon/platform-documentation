title: Redis out-of-memory error
---
This release addressed several issues, including those affecting Redis, new branch names, default behavior for Site inboxes, and inbox target options.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue causing a Redis out-of-memory error. For more information, please read our [issue postmortem](https://status.cloudcannon.com/incidents/mjyt5cv6gzq4).
* Fixed an issue where, when creating a new branch, CloudCannon added quotation marks to the suggested *Branch name* if you used them in the *Site name*.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon would automatically assign new inboxes as the default inbox for a Site, if it was the only inbox connected.
* Removed Automate and Integromat as Inbox target options for new form inboxes.
