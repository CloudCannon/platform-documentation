This release added the key `uploads_use_relative_path` for referencing files uploaded from an editing interface and the `template` option for configuring previews. It also ensured that files open in an editing interface will automatically reload when updated via your Git repository.

This release addressed several issues, including those affecting UI elements in rich text inputs, table contents and navigation, conflicting updates, and uploading multiple files using a file input.

### Features & Improvements:

* Added a new key `uploads_use_relative_path`. When set to `true`, uploading a file from within an editing interface causes CloudCannon to reference files relative to the path of the file they were uploaded to.
* You can now use the `template` option within the `preview` key.
* Files open in an editing interface will automatically reload when updated via your Git repository, provided no conflicting updates exist.

### Fixes:

* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon would add an `<hr>` line to empty files in the Content Editor and rich text inputs.
* Fixed an issue where copying a link from Google Sheets would add a &lt;u&gt; tag.
* Fixed an issue where, in rich text inputs, CloudCannon would cut off long dropdown menus from the WYSIWYG toolbar and control panels for snippets or links.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon would forcibly convert the contents of table cells to text. Table cells can now contain nested tables, lists, and paragraphs.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, using the keyboard to navigate a table had unexpected behavior.
* Fixed an issue where recently open files would, in some cases, overwrite incoming changes from your Git provider.
* Fixed an issue where, after resolving a conflicting update by saving your unsaved changes, CloudCannon would not automatically pull the blocked updates from your Git provider.
* Fixed an issue where uploading multiple files through a file input would cause the browser to load infinitely.
* Fixed an issue where images did not save or load correctly if you had `baseurl` configured.
