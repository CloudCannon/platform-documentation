**Fixes:**

* Dependency updates to patch security vulnerabilities.
* Fixed some errors that could occur when editing a Markdown file with no frontmatter.
* jQuery is now loaded from the jQuery CDN instead of from Google, to support CloudCannon being loaded more reliably.
* Fixed an error preventing visual editing of data files.

* Fixed an issue which sometimes prevented the data editor from loading.
