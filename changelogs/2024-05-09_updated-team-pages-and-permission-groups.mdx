title: Updated Team pages and Permission Groups
type: major
---
This release updated the appearance and functionality of several pages in the app, including the Team, Site Sharing, Client Sharing, and Organization List pages. We've updated how you invite people to your Organization, manage your team members, and share your Sites. We have also introduced [Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-permission-groups/), a new way to determine what actions a team member can perform within your Organization. CloudCannon's new [default Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/) have the same functionality as the "permission levels" you are used to, but, allow us to create the infrastructure for our next feature update: custom Permission Groups.

[Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/) are now available to select Team and Enterprise customers for early access. The official release of custom Permission Groups is coming soon. Until then, for more information on these changes, please see the [Sharing section](/documentation/articles/introduction-to-sharing/) of our documentation.
