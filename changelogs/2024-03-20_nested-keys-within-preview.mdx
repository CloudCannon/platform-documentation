title: Nested keys within preview
type: minor
---
This release added nested keys to preview.

It also addressed several issues, including some affecting DAMs, copying links from Google Docs, Hugo hardWraps, and conflicting updates.

### Features & Improvements:

* You can now use nested keys within `preview`.

### Fixes:

* Fixed an issue where branched sites would not copy the state of the "upload locked" flag, allowing you to upload images to your git repository rather than your DAM.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon failed to respect the extra prefix option when searching and uploading to larger DAMS.
* Fixed an issue where you could not see non-image files in a Cloudinary DAM via the CloudCannon browser.
* Fixed an issue where copying a link from Google Docs would add a `<u>` tag.
* Fixed an issue where quotation marks would be replaced by `&quot;`.
* Fixed an issue where Hugo `hardWraps` was false by default. The `hardWraps` key will now match your Hugo config file.
* Fixed an issue where bolding text would cause unexpected behavior.
* Fixed an issue where the Verify Email form could sometimes be submitted twice, causing an error.
* Fixed an issue where saving new files would, in some cases, prevent you from resolving conflicting updates.
* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
