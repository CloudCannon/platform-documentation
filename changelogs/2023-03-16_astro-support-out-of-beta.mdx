type: minor
---

This release provides increased support for static sites built with Astro and marks the end of our beta. Try our fully featured Astro template called [Sendit](https://app.cloudcannon.com/editor#sites/connect/github/CloudCannon/sendit-astro-template/main), and see [our starter guide for Astro](/documentation/guides/astro-starter-guide/) here.

**Features:**

* [Commit message templates](/documentation/articles/formatting-your-commit-messages/) are now available to all users.
* Build configuration fields now use a mono-space font for better readability.
* When exporting form submission data to CSV, the form data is now separated nicely into columns.

**Fixes:**

* Logging out of site authentication now works more reliably
