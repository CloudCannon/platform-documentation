title: UI Improvements 2021
type: major
---
We’re really excited to release the updates to our app UI outlined in our blog post: [Sparking joy: CloudCannon UI improvements](https://cloudcannon.com/blog/ui-improvements-2021/). Along with the usual fixes we’ve also overhauled the settings area for Custom domains.

**Features:**

* Tidied up type, colours and icons.
* Eight pixel borders across the majority of our elements.
* Improved button hierarchy, and styles including hover states and active effects.
* Cleaner site menu, context menus, file browser and dropdowns.
* Improved image selector for editable class and data inputs.
* Overhauled Custom domain setup pages.
* Added separate page for preview URL details (future configurations to come here).
* Added option to configure wildcard redirects for subdomains.

**Fixes:**

* Fixed issue loading the data-editor JSON files with top-level arrays.
* Fixed YAML indentation when saving a new collection item.
* Fixed issue with content menu for link inputs rendering on the wrong position.

**Future Changes:**

In an upcoming release, we will be adding support for `Node.js 16.x` and making `Node.js 16.x `and `npm 7.x` the default versions. To stay on `Node.js 14.x` you can add a `.nvmrc` file to the site and run `nvm use` (or simply run `nvm use 14`) in the [build hooks](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#usage).
