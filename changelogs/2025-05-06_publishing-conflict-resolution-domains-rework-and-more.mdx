title: Publishing Conflict Resolution, Domains rework, and more!
---
Features from our most recent Beta are now available to all users. These features include a Publishing Conflict resolution workflow

Thank you to everyone who assisted in our Publishing Conflict Resolution Private Beta. Your feedback is always valuable to our team.

If required, you can return to the Legacy version of the app at any time using the *Enter Legacy* button in the *App sidebar*. CloudCannon Legacy is available for a short time. CloudCannon will support the Legacy app until June 3rd, 2025. If you have any feedback about this change, please get in touch with our [support team](/support/) or contact us through your dedicated Slack channel.

## Features & Improvements

### Publishing Conflict Resolution

You no longer need to rely on your developer or Git provider to resolve [Publishing Conflicts](/documentation/articles/what-are-publishing-conflicts/) â€” you can do it in CloudCannon! When updating your Site from its Publish Branch reveals a Publishing Conflict, CloudCannon will list all conflicted files on the *Publishing* page and allow you to resolve this issue by selecting which version of a file to keep, or create a hybrid of your current and incoming changes.

For more information, please read our documentation on [resolving Publishing Conflicts](/documentation/articles/resolve-publishing-conflicts/).

<comp.Notice info_type="permissions">
  **Permissions required**

  Members of the Owners, Developers, and Technical Editors [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/), or [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/) with the `site:source-editor:write` and `site:publish:upstream:write` permissions, can resolve Publishing Conflicts.
</comp.Notice>

* When you click the *Update from Publish Branch* button on the *Publishing* page to update your Site from its Publish Branch, CloudCannon may detect a Publishing Conflict. A Publishing Conflict occurs when the version of a file incoming from your Publish Branch and the version of the same file on your current branch do not match.
* You must resolve your Publishing Conflicts, or abandon the attempt to update your Site from it's Publish Branch, before you can publish to your Publish Branch or save changes to your files without addressing the conflicted files.
* To prevent CloudCannon from detecting Publishing Conflicts while someone is editing your Site, you cannot attempt to update from your Publish Branch while you have unsaved changes.
  * We do not recommend editing your files while an update attempt is in progress, unless those edits are related to a conflict.

* CloudCannon will alert you to a Publishing Conflict with a red warning notification over the *Publish* button and a warning banner in all editing interfaces.

* When CloudCannon detects a Publishing Conflict, it will show you a list of all files with incoming changes, including files with conflicts, on the *Publishing* page.
* When you click on the card for a conflicted file, CloudCannon will open the Source Editor and highlight the conflicted sections. CloudCannon will highlight the changes to the file from your current branch in red and the incoming changes from the Publish Branch in green.
* You can click on the *Use current* or *Use incoming* buttons to replace one change with another or click into the Source Editor to make a hybrid of the changes manually.
* You can quickly move to the next conflict in a large file by clicking the *Scroll to next conflict* button.
* When you have finished resolving conflicts in a file, you can click the *Mark as resolved* button to save the file.

<comp.DocsImage path="" alt="publishing page" title="" type="screenshot"/>

* When you have resolved all conflicted files, click the *Update from Publish Branch* button. CloudCannon will complete the update from your Publish Branch.
* If you resolve all conflicted files, CloudCannon will also save any unsaved changes made to your Site after the update attempt began.
* Alternatively, if you do not want to resolve your Publishing Conflicts immediately, you can abandon the attempt to update your Site from its Publish Branch using the *Abandon update attempt* button on the *Publishing* page.
* If you abandon your update attempt, CloudCannon will discard all unsaved changes.
* After abandoning your update attempt, you can return to editing your files and saving changes. CloudCannon will remove all warnings about Publishing Conflicts. However, you must still resolve your Publishing Conflicts before you can publish changes from this Site to your Publish Branch.
* CloudCannon will remind you about any unresolved Publishing Conflicts the next time you try to publish from this Site or update from your Publish Branch.

<comp.DocsImage path="" alt="complex" title="" type="ui-snippet"/>

* If CloudCannon detects a Publishing Conflict that you cannot solve in the Source Editor (e.g., a conflict in an image file), the update from your Publish Branch will fail.
* For more information on a failed update attempt, please see your most recent Syncing log.

### *Domains* section rework

To provide a better hosting experience on CloudCannon, we've improved the appearance and functionality of the *Domains* section of the app, and consolidated Custom Domain related settings into a single location.

* We have updated the *Domains browser*, found using the *Domains* button in the *App sidebar*.
* The *Domains browser* shows all domains connected to your Organization. Each domain is represented by a card.
* Domain card metadata shows you the status of your domain, how many CloudCannon subdomains are connected to that domain, and whether the domain uses CloudCannon or External DNS.
* In addition to connecting a Custom Domain through your *Site Settings*, you can now connect a domain to your Organization using the *\+ Connect a Domain* button in the top right of the *Domains browser*.

<comp.DocsImage path="" alt="domains browser" title="" type="screenshot"/>

* When connecting a domain to your Organization, CloudCannon now requires you to select your DNS provider upfront.
* When you click the *Connect Domain* button, CloudCannon will take you to that domain's dedicated *Domain* page.

<comp.DocsImage path="" alt="connect a domain" title="" type="screenshot"/>

* The *Domain* page allows you to review and manage all settings for a given Custom Domain. Some Custom Domain settings from the *Custom Domain* page under *Site Settings* have been moved to this location.
* The *Domain* page has four tabs: the *Network* tab, the *DNS* tab, the *Sites* tab, and the *Domain Settings* tab.
* The *Network* tab shows the status of your Nameservers, lists all your subdomains in a *Subdomains browser*, and shows the Fallback redirect for all unconfigured subdomains.
  * You can now select the subdomain for the Fallback redirect using a dropdown, rather than a list.

<comp.DocsImage path="" alt="network tab" title="" type="screenshot"/>

* The *DNS* tab lists all DNS records configured for your domain, and includes a search bar and *Create record* button in the top right. You can edit or delete each DNS record using the *Context Menu* in the top right of the card.

<comp.DocsImage path="" alt="dns tab" title="" type="screenshot"/>

* The *Sites* tab lists of all Sites connected to your domain. You can navigate to a Site by clicking on the card.

<comp.DocsImage path="" alt="sites tab" title="" type="screenshot"/>

* The *Domain Settings* tab has two sections: *Details* and *Danger*. You can edit your *DNS Provider* or disconnect the domain from your Organization.
* You cannot disconnect a Custom Domain from your Organization until you have removed it from all CloudCannon Sites.

<comp.DocsImage path="" alt="settings tab" title="" type="screenshot"/>

* The app now uses more consistent language regarding Custom Domains, such as "connecting" and "disconnecting" a domain from your Organizations, or "adding" and "removing" domains from Sites in CloudCannon.
