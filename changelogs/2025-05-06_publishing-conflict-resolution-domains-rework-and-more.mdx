## Features & Improvements

### Publishing Conflict Resolution

You no longer need to rely on your developer or Git provider to resolve [Publishing Conflicts](/documentation/articles/what-are-publishing-conflicts/) â€” you can do it in CloudCannon! When updating your Site from its Publish Branch reveals a Publishing Conflict, CloudCannon will list all conflicted files on the *Publishing* page and allow you to resolve this issue by selecting which version of a file to keep, or create a hybrid of your current and incoming changes.

For more information, please read our documentation on [resolving Publishing Conflicts](/documentation/articles/resolve-publishing-conflicts/).

<comp.Notice info_type="permissions">
  **Permissions required**

  Members of the Owners, Developers, and Technical Editors [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/), or [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/) with the `site:source-editor:write` and `site:publish:upstream:write` permissions, can resolve Publishing Conflicts.

* When you click the *Update from Publish Branch* button on the *Publishing* page to update your Site from its Publish Branch, CloudCannon may detect a Publishing Conflict. A Publishing Conflict occurs when the version of a file incoming from your Publish Branch and the version of the same file on your current branch do not match.
* When CloudCannon detects a Publishing Conflict, it will now show you a list of all files with incoming changes, including files with conflicts, on the *Publishing* page.
