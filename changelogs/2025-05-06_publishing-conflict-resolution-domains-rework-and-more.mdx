## Features & Improvements

### Publishing Conflict Resolution

You no longer need to rely on your developer or Git provider to resolve [Publishing Conflicts](/documentation/articles/what-are-publishing-conflicts/) â€” you can do it in CloudCannon! When updating your Site from its Publish Branch reveals a Publishing Conflict, CloudCannon will list all conflicted files on the *Publishing* page and allow you to resolve this issue by selecting which version of a file to keep, or create a hybrid of your current and incoming changes.

For more information, please read our documentation on [resolving Publishing Conflicts](/documentation/articles/resolve-publishing-conflicts/).

<comp.Notice info_type="permissions">
  **Permissions required**

  Members of the Owners, Developers, and Technical Editors [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/), or [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/) with the `site:source-editor:write` and `site:publish:upstream:write` permissions, can resolve Publishing Conflicts.

* When you click the *Update from Publish Branch* button on the *Publishing* page to update your Site from its Publish Branch, CloudCannon may detect a Publishing Conflict. A Publishing Conflict occurs when the version of a file incoming from your Publish Branch and the version of the same file on your current branch do not match.
* You must resolve your Publishing Conflicts, or abandon the attempt to update your Site from it's Publish Branch, before you can publish to your Publish Branch or save changes to your files without addressing the conflicted files.
* To prevent CloudCannon from detecting Publishing Conflicts while someone is editing your Site, you cannot attempt to update from your Publish Branch while you have unsaved changes.
  * We do not recommend editing your files while an update attempt is in progress, unless those edits are related to a conflict.

* CloudCannon will alert you to a Publishing Conflict with a red warning notification over the *Publish* button and a warning banner in all editing interfaces.

* When CloudCannon detects a Publishing Conflict, it will show you a list of all files with incoming changes, including files with conflicts, on the *Publishing* page.
* When you click on the card for a conflicted file, CloudCannon will open the Source Editor and highlight the conflicted sections. CloudCannon will highlight the changes to the file from your current branch in red and the incoming changes from the Publish Branch in green.
* You can click on the *Use current* or *Use incoming* buttons to replace one change with another or click into the Source Editor to make a hybrid of the changes manually.
* You can quickly move to the next conflict in a large file by clicking the *Scroll to next conflict* button.
* When you have finished resolving conflicts in a file, you can click the *Mark as resolved* button to save the file.
