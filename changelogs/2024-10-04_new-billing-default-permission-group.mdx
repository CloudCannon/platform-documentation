title: New "Billing" default Permission Group
---
This release added a new default Permission Group, commit message configuration to the CloudCannon configuration file in the Data Editor, and improved error handling and accessibility.

It also addressed several issues, including those affecting building, the CloudCannon configuration file, Client Sharing, Rich Text inputs, unsaved Collection files.

## Features & Improvements

* Added a new default Permission Group called "Billing". This Permission Group allows members to edit Billing settings for a Site. You can be a member of this group as well as the Editor, Technical Editor, or Developer group.
* Added commit message configuration when you open the CloudCannon configuration file in the Data Editor.
* Improved error handling for misconfigured `data_config` entries.
* Improved accessibility for the build suggestions section on the *Status* page after a failed build.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue preventing you from building your Site if you set `SYNC_PATHS` to a large directory.
* Fixed an issue where, if you enabled the *Require rebuild on branch* setting, CloudCannon would incorrectly trigger a build before switching branches.
* Fixed an issue where changes made to the CloudCannon configuration file did not persist between CloudCannon and CloudCannon Legacy.
* Fixed an issue where Client Sharing users could not use the Visual Editor.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, Markdown and HTML inputs would become misconfigured.
* Fixed an issue where you could not use File inputs in a new, unsaved Collection file.
