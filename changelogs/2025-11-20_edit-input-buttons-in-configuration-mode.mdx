title: Edit Input buttons in Configuration Mode
---
This release added several improvements, including Input configuration to *Configuration Mode*, better app behavior when merging a branch, better UI for the *Build Configuration* page, better error messaging, and the capacity to browse DAM assets.

It also addressed several issues, including those affecting *Configuration Mode* data panels, the Conflict Resolution code editor, and filters in *Inboxes*.

## Features & Improvements

* You can now edit your Input configuration using *Configuration Mode*.
  * Turning *Configuration Mode* on in an editing interface will show purple *Edit* buttons next to each Input, which will open the *Edit Input* data panel.
  * You can use the *Edit Input* data panel to update the configuration across several levels of the configuration cascade and review where an input is already configured.
  * Any configuration updated using *Configuration Mode* will immediately change the Input in your editing interface, unless superseded by a more specific configuration.
* CloudCannon now returns you to your *Site Browser* after merging and deleting a branch, rather than showing an error.
* Better UI for the *Initial Site Settings* prompt on the *Build Configuration* page under *Site Settings*.
* Better UI for the *Needs Attention* prompt on the *Site Dashboard*.
* Added error messaging in the *Needs Attention* prompt on your *Site Dashboard* when you have a parsing issue in your *CloudCannon Configuration File*.
* You can no longer see *Inboxes* in your *Site Navigation* if you do not have permission to use them.
* You can now browse through your DAM assets using the *Browse* tab on your DAM page, through the *Assets* page under *Org Settings*.
* You can now configure `_inputs.$` to add comments and documentation links to the top-level object or array in a data file.
* Improved the performance of the File Input upload browser.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where updates to a *Structure* did not immediately appear in the Data Editor.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon's autosave would shift which field was focused in the Data Editor.

* Fixed incorrect spacing for the *Save* and *Discard* buttons in the *Save Changes* modal.
