title: MIME type metadata for Azure DAM uploads
type: minor
---
This release added a MIME type metadata option for Azure DAM uploads. It also addressed issues affecting .json schemas, arrays, and the Client Organization list.

### Features:

* Added a checkbox to Organization DAM settings to include an extra header in all Azure uploads, indicating the MIME type of uploaded file(s).
  * This checkbox is on by default for new DAMs and off for existing DAMs. If you have an older DAM, you may need to update the "Allowed Headers" in your "Resource sharing (CORS)" settings in Azure to enable this setting.

### Fixes:

* Fixed an issue where the editing interface would fail to load collection items with a .json schema.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon would apply a structure to an array.
* Fixed an issue where navigating to another browser tab and back would cause the Client Organization list to refresh.
* Fixed an issue preventing dart-sass from running and updated to a new version of dart-sass.
* Better messaging for the number of commits pending on the Publishing page.
* Improved reliability of GitLab direct publish.
* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
