title: Gatsby support out of beta
type: minor
---
This release provides increased support for static sites built with Gatsby and marks the end of our beta. Try out our fully featured Gatsby template called [Sendit](https://app.cloudcannon.com/editor#sites/connect/github/CloudCannon/sendit-gatsby-template/main).

**Features:**

* Gatsby support is no longer in beta.
* Added automated suggestions for several common build issues.
* The UI for image inputs have been reworked to display more helpful information.
* Commit messages have a larger text area for editing by default. Inputs for commit messages can now be configured for finer control.

**Fixes:**

* Popups in the editor will now resize automatically when moving between parent/child objects of different sizes.
* Prevent blank popups from opening when clicking on uneditable snippets.
* Added some checks to confirm before overwriting DAM files, in case of filename collisions.
