This release improved the reliability of *Schemas* when creating new files and loading existing files in the *Data Editor*, and added more controls to the *Bandwidth* graphs on the *Org Home* and *Site Dashboard* pages.

It also addressed several issues, including those affecting Hugo shortcodes, filtering in the *Collection Browser*.

## Features & Improvements

* Updated *Schema* files to use unsaved content from your current editing session. Previously, *Schemas* used the last saved version of the file, which meant changes to a *Schema* file would not take effect until after saving.
* Added more controls to the *Bandwidth* graph under the *Usage* tab for the *Org Home* and *Site Dashboard* pages. You can now select a custom date ranges, group the *Bandwidth* table by *Site* (*Org Home* only), and load more records on the *Bandwidth* table.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where CloudCanon would fail to load *Schema* files and *Default content* files with Markdown extensions (`.md`) if the front matter block was missing its closing `---` fence. CloudCannon now falls back to parsing the file content as YAML in this case.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, creating multiple files from the same *Schema* could result in duplicated or incorrect front matter data. This issue also affected body content in data file *Schemas* (`.json`, `.yml`, `.yaml`, `.toml`).
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, CLoudCannon would incorrectly apply  YAML front matter indentation when creating new files from a *Schema*.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon would incorrectly save unknown Hugo shortcodes when the shortcode name contains a `/` character.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, filtering many files in the *Collection Browser* caused an error.
* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
