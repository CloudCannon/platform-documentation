This release adds live editing to our two SvelteKit templates, [Justice](https://cloudcannon.com/community/themes/justice/) and [Urban](https://cloudcannon.com/community/themes/urban/). Learn how to [add live editing to your SvelteKit site](/documentation/articles/live-editing-with-svelte/). Also included is a fix for collection detection for Jekyll and Hugo sites.

**Features:**

* Live editing for SvelteKit sites 🎉

**Fixes:**

* Collection subfolders that only contain a \_defaults file will now correctly show in the CloudCannon interface
* Fixed a dependency issue in the SvelteKit templates
