This release has a complete overhaul of the site authentication. This includes:

* [User accounts](/documentation/host/authentication/#user-account-login) allowing you to limit access to your site based on an email address
* [Authenticated routes](/documentation/host/authentication/#custom-routes) allows you to have private sections of a site
* [Date/time front matter interfaces](/documentation/edit/interfaces/front-matter-editor/)
* [Prototyping sites](/documentation/host/authentication/none/#none) no longer require a password. Instead viewers will be presented with a splash screen before viewing the site.
* Internationalisation language detection incorporates the country more effectively.
* Disabled HTTP access on app.cloudcannon.com
* Better date handling on draft posts. If a date is already defined when published it will maintain that date
* Syncing with GitHub handles force pushes
* General bug fixes
