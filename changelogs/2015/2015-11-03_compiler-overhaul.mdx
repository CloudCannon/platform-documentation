Since the last release, we've focused on back end performance and infrastructure. Performance and stability has increased across most of our services, including an improved system for processing sites. Sites are now processed, compiled and compressed faster and more reliably.

**Features:**

* Native browser spellcheck support
* Improved style on payment detail emails

**Fixes:**

* Issue with repeatables on non Jekyll sites
