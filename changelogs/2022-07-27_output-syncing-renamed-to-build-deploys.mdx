title: Output Syncing renamed to Build Deploys
type: minor
---
This release renames Output Syncing to [Build Deploys](/documentation/articles/output-a-built-site-from-cloudcannon-to-an-external-provider/) and moves the feature to the hosting section in the Site Settings. Build deploys are used to deploy your built files to an external provider. User interviews identified confusion with which syncing to use (output or source) and we hope this clears things up.

**Features:**

* Renamed Output Syncing to Build Deploys

**Fixes:**

* Resolved circular reference error on visual editor load
