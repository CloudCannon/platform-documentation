This release addresses several issues with connecting to Cloudinary within CloudCannon.  Any further issues should be fixed by refreshing your browser.

We’ve also released fixes for form attachments, SSL certificates, and a few UI bugs.

**Fixes:**

* Fixed an issue preventing Custom SSL certificates from being uploaded to Cloudflare
