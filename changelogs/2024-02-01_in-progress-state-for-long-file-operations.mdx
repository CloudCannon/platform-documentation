title: '"In progress" state for long file operations'
type: minor
---
This release added notifications when someone unsubscribes from an inbox target, updated the sign-up link for individuals invited through SSO, separate billing names for invoices, and an "in progress" state for long file operations.

It also addressed several issues affecting pull requests and tab navigation in the Data Editor and updated CloudCannon's dependencies.

### Features:

* Account owners are now notified by email when someone unsubscribes from an inbox target.
* When you invite someone to an organization using SSO, CloudCannon now sends them an email link to the SSO sign-up page rather than the standard sign-up page.
* You can now use a different billing name on your invoice independent of your organization name.
* When performing long file operations (e.g., cloning a large folder), CloudCannon now shows an "in progress" state.

### Fixes:

* Fixed an issue where pull requests with no title would cause a 500 error.
* Fixed an issue where inputs with the same key name could break tab navigation in the Data Editor.
* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
