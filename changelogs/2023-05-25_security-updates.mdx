HTML is now sanitized before rendering in any rich text editors. Unsupported elements will now be represented with uneditable boxes in rich text editors,&nbsp;to prevent cross-site scripting attacks and to help avoid cases where team members may accidentally destroy custom markup. See [this article](/documentation/articles/best-practices-for-rich-text/) for more details about how this works and best practices for custom markup in rich text content.

**Features:**

* HTML is now sanitized using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/leizongmin/js-xss">js-xss</a> before loading in the rich text editor.

**Fixes:**

* Renaming a folder in CloudCannon no longer causes a sync error.
* Patched security vulnerabilities.
