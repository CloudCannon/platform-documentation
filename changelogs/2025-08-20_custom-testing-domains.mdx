title: Custom Testing Domains
---
This release added custom Testing Domains and the `hide_link_to_telephone` key to URL inputs.

It also addressed an issue causing the browser to freeze.

## Features & Improvements

* Added custom Testing Domains for the [Team and Enterprise plans](/pricing/) and members of our [Partner Program](/partner-program/). Custom Testing Domain lets you choose the domain name for your `.cloudvent.net` URL by setting a unique Organization handle for all Testing Domains and entering a unique prefix whenever you create a new Site.
* Added the capacity to link to a phone number using a URL input, which prepends the value of the input with `tel:`.
* Added the `hide_link_to_telephone` key to URL inputs. By default, this key is `false`, except on Sites created before 20 August 2025, where the value is true. This will preserve existing behavior preferences.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue causing the browser to freeze.
