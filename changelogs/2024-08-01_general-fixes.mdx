This release addressed several issues, including those affecting permissions, uploading to Cloudinary DAMs, and the search bars in the file and DAM browsers.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue preventing some actions in CloudCannon if you had two permissions using the same resource.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, Cloudinary DAMs did not show recently uploaded assets in the browser.
* Fixed an issue where entering a search term in the CloudCannon File Browser or the DAM browser would also filter content in the other browser.
