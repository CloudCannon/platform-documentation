title: Updated Site creation UI
---
This release added several improvements to the onboarding and initial Site creation process, the appearance of the *Sites* and *Projects* pages, Jekyll codeblock behavior, and error messages after logging in fails.

It also addressed several issues, including those affecting new Collection items, app behavior when using two tabs, SSO, images in your DAM, Site icons, and uneditable snippets.

## Features & Improvements

* Hid non-essential UI elements during initial Site setup.
* Updated the onboarding survey for new users setting up their first Site.
* Updated the appearance of the *Sites* list page when you have no Sites.
* Updated the appearance of the *Projects* list page when you have no Projects.
* For Jekyll Sites, CloudCannon no longer adds `{%raw%}` and `{%highlight%}` tags to your codeblocks automatically if you include templating in your Markdown. Please use the Raw or Highlight snippets.
* Clearer error messages when logging in fails.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, CloudCannon did not apply your Collection configuration to new Collection items unless you refreshed the app.
* Fixed an issue causing unexpected behavior when deleting or saving files on the same Site in two different tabs on the same Internet browser.
* Fixed an issue where the *Setup SSO* prompt would persist after you had finished setting up SSO.
* Fixed an issue whereCloudCannon did not apply `mime_type` and `expandable` to images in your DAM.
* Fixed an issue causing Site icons to break when you used relative URLs with a DAM.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, CloudCannon would add extra non-breaking spaces around uneditable snippets protecting [custom markup](/documentation/articles/best-practices-for-rich-text/#unsupported-html-elements-in-rich-text-editors).
* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
