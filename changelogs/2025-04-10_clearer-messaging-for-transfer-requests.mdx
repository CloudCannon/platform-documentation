title: Clearer messaging for Transfer Requests
---
This release improved the messaging around Transfer Requests, including what information CloudCannon includes, and added `.` character stripping from subdomains.

It also addressed an issue affecting Snippets in the Visual Editor.

## Features & Improvements

* Added better messaging for Transfer Requests, such as indicating which additional resources CloudCannon will also include in the transfer (i.e., Sites, Domains, Inboxes, or DAMs) are connected to the resource you selected.
* Transfer Requests now include the Site name, and any connected Domain, Inbox, or DAM names.
* CloudCannon now strips any `.` characters from the subdomain field when you configure a new subdomain.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, Snippets did not work in the Visual Editor.
* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
