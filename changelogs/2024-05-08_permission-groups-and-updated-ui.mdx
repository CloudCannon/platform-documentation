title: Permission Groups and updated UI
type: major

This release introduces [Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-permission-groups/), a new way to determine what actions a team member can perform within your Organization. CloudCannon's new [default Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/) have the same functionality as the "permission levels" you are used to, but they allow us to create the infrastructure for our next feature update: custom Permission Groups.

[Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/) are now available to select Team and Enterprise customers for early access. The official release of custom Permission Groups is coming soon. Until then, for more information on these changes, please see the [Sharing section](/documentation/articles/introduction-to-sharing/) of our documentation.

This release updated the appearance and functionality of several pages in the app, including the Team, Client Sharing, and Organization List pages. We've also updated how you invite people to your Organization, manage your team members, and share your Sites.

## Features & Improvements:

### Permission Groups

<comp.DocsImage path="" alt="" title=""/>

* You now determine what actions a team member can perform within your Organization by assigning them to a Permission Group. Every team member in your Organization must be a member of at least one Group.
* Each Permission Group contains a set of permissions. CloudCannon will allow an action if a team member has permission from at least one Permission Group.
* A Permission consists of a list of resources and the scope those resources apply to.
  * A resource is something you can interact with in CloudCannon (e.g., a Site, Pull Requests, Settings, Billing, etc.). Each resource also defines how a Group member can interact with that resource (i.e., the capacity to Read, Write, or Create a resource).
  * Scope defines how broadly a permission is applied (e.g., a permission with a Site scope will only apply to a specific Site, whereas a permission with a Global scope will apply to the entire Organization).
* CloudCannon provides several default Permission Groups with the same name and functionality as our old "permission levels." These include:
  * Four Permission Groups with a Global scope (Owners, Developers, Technical Editors, and Editors).
  * Two Permission Groups per Site, each with a Site scope for Site Sharing (Technical Editors and Editors).
  * One Permission Group per Site with a Site scope for Client Sharing.
* CloudCannon has migrated all your team members into the appropriate Permission Group based on their previous "permission level."
* CloudCannon will hide UI elements in the app if a team member does not have permission to interact with them (e.g., Billing will not appear in the *Org Setting* menu for members of the Editors Permission Group).
* CloudCannon no longer defines the recipient of Site Sharing as a Collaborator or someone from outside your Organization. The recipient of Site Sharing is now a team member of your Organization with access to specific Sites rather than Global access.

### UI updates for Team, Team Member, and Group pages

<comp.DocsImage path="" alt="" title=""/>

* The *Team* page in *Org Settings* now has two tabs: *Members* and *Groups*.
  * The *Members* tab lists all current team members in your Organization. This list displays each member's name, email address, how many Permission Groups they belong to, and whether they are a pending member. You can click on a team member to open their *Team Member* page.
  * The *Groups* tab lists all the Permission Groups within your Organization. This list displays the Group's name and how many members it has. You can click on a Group to open the *Group* page.
* Information from the *Collaborators* tab on the *Team* page is now a part of the *Groups* tab. The *Groups* tab shows two Permission Groups for each Site using Site Sharing.
* The *Client Shares* tab from the *Team* page is now a separate page. Please see the *Client Sharing* page under *Org Settings*.
* Each team member in your Organization now has a *Team Member* page. This page lists all the Permission Groups a team member belongs to.
* Each Permission Group in your Organization has a *Group* page with two tabs: *Members* and *Settings*. The *Members* tab lists all Group members. The *Settings* tab lists all the permissions in that Group. You can click on a permission for more details.

### UI update for Client Sharing page

<comp.DocsImage path="" alt="" title=""/>

* The *Client Sharing* page in *Org Settings* lists all the Sites in your Organization that have Client Sharing enabled.
