This release

### Features & Improvements:

* You can now use the `allow_custom_markup` key to enable the capacity to edit any HTML or Markdown structure that cannot be recreated in the rich text editor.
  * This key allows you to explicitly accept the risk of unintentionally deleting elements that cannot be recreated.
  * You can define the `allow_custom_markup` key anywhere you would configure a rich text toolbar. By default, this key is \`false\` for inputs and \`true\` for editable regions.
  * You can also enable `allow_custom_markup` in the configuration GUI.
  * When using `allow_custom_markup` outside of editable regions, content that uses JavaScript will not be editable for security reasons. These inputs will appear as uneditable snippets.
  * For more information, please read our documentation on best practices for HTML in&nbsp;<a href="http:///documentation/articles/best-practices-for-rich-text/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rich text</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http:///documentation/articles/define-editable-regions-in-your-html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">editable regions</a>.
* You can now add documentation links to checkboxes and switches.
* You can now copy your build log using the&nbsp;*Copy output*&nbsp;button in the build modal, on the&nbsp;*Status*&nbsp;page, and in the&nbsp;*Builds*&nbsp;history tab.
* You can now specify a custom URL for your dashboard preview screenshot using `editor.default_path`.
* You can now use nested keys for any key inside `preview`.
* The&nbsp;*View output*&nbsp;button is now available while your build is optimizing assets.

### Fixes:

* Fixed an issue where, in the Visual Editor, updating the details for an image would cause the image panel to close.
* Fixed an issue where the&nbsp;*Context menu*&nbsp;for array and object inputs would show "Add undefined" instead of "Add item" for structures with no label configured.
* Fixed a spacing issue affecting collapsed card lists.
* Fixed an issue where image panels would open in the wrong place.
* Fixed an issue where screen readers would lose focus every time a new line appeared in the terminal.
* Fixed an issue where you could not scroll a data file on devices with a smaller screen.
* Fixed an issue where, for image inputs with resize configured, CloudCannon would unnecessarily duplicate images that already matched the specified height and width.
* Fixed an issue where, on branches that had a file with the same name as the branch, git pulls would not work.
* Fixed an issue preventing you from pushing local changes to a new branch.
* Fixed an issue where opening a file in an editing interface would automatically add focus to the first input.
* Fixed an issue where opening a file in an editing interface would trigger a change to that file without you updating any content.
* Updated the color of inconsistent icons in the&nbsp;*WYSIWYG toolbar.*
* Updated the copy in the&nbsp;*Switch to editing*&nbsp;banner and the Legacy&nbsp;*Editing locked*&nbsp;banner.
