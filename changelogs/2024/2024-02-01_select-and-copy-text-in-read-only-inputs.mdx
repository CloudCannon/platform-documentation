This release added notifications when someone unsubscribes from an inbox target, updated the sign-up link for individuals invited through SSO, separate billing names for invoices, and selecting read-only text

It also addressed several issues affecting pull requests and tab navigation in the Data Editor and updated CloudCannon's dependencies.

### Features:

* Account owners are now notified by email when someone unsubscribes from an inbox target.
* When you invite someone to an organization using SSO, CloudCannon now sends them an email link to the SSO sign-up page rather than the standard sign-up page.
* You can now use a different billing name on your invoice independent of your organization name.
* You can now select and copy text in read-only inputs.

### Fixes:

* Fixed an issue where pull requests with no title would cause a 500 error.
* Fixed an issue where inputs with the same key name could break tab navigation in the Data Editor.
* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
