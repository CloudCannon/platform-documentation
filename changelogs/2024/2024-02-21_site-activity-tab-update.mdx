This release updated the appearance and functionality of the *Site Activity* tab. This tab now lists more types of site activity, including information about changes from external sources, branch settings, and sync or output errors. The tab will also refresh with each sync or *Site Settings* update.

This release also made minor copy changes in the app, allowed users to sync files while an editing session was open, and adding name and email configuration for Client Sharing.

This release addressed issues affecting Site Mounting, the Cloudflare icon, domain releases, DAMs, and the *Sync files* button.
