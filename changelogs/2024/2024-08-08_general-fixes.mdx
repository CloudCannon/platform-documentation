This release addressed several issues, including those affecting inputs, structures, uploading DAM assets, and accessibility for tables in the Content Editor.

## Features & Improvements

* Updated the default Hugo version to 0.128.1.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, CloudCannon would not replace the value of an input with the structure it was linked to.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, an input could remove itself by applying a structure to itself.
* Fixed an issue where a child object would incorrectly use the parent structure if it did not have its own.
* Fixed an issue where mutable object entries could use an incorrect structure.
* Fixed an issue where many mutable Object inputs appeared as Text inputs in the Data Editor regardless of their configured type.
* Fixed an issue where updating the value of an input to match the structure would create an array.
* Fixed an issue where overwriting a DAM asset incorrectly displayed two copies of that asset in the DAM browser.
* Fixed an issue where the DAM browser could simultaneously show assets and the "empty folder" icon.
* Fixed an accessibility issue where, in the Content Editor, you could not open the *Context menu* on a table cell using keyboard controls. You can now use "Shift + F10" to open the *Context menu.*
* Fixed an issue where overwriting multiple DAM assets with the suffix "-\[number\]" in the filename would cause a race condition.
* Removed support for Node 10 and 12.
