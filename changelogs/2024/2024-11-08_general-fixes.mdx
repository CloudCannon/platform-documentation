This release addressed issues relating to configuration generation, and merging cells in a table, as well as fixing a broken link.

## Fixes

* CloudCannon will now always persist tables as HTML if there are any merged cells, since there is no syntax for representing this in Markdown.
* Fixed a broken link in the Site Settings prompt to finish editing the configuration file.
* Fixed an issue that sometimes caused newly generated configuration from being saved to the configuration file.
