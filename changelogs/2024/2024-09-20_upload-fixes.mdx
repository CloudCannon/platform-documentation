This release fixes issues relating to uploading images.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where uploading an image would fail to generate a non-clashing filename, in cases where the first 100 attempts all clashed with an existing file.
* Fixed an issue where files could sometimes be saved with the wrong path when using the `uploads_use_relative_path` option.
* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
