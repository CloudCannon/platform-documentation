The CloudCannon Legacy app is no longer available. Thank you to everyone who provided feedback during this process; we have addressed all issues brought to our attention. If you have any further feedback or questions, please don't hesitate to contact our friendly [support team](/support/).

This release added ARIA attributes to the password strength label, new key descriptions for the *Collections* section in the CloudCannon configuration file, removed the *Recent activity* section for users without permission to read it, and added an extra setup prompt if you delete your configuration file.

It also addressed several issues, including those affecting renaming files, Headless Mode, Client Sharing, Schemas in the *\+ Add* button dropdown, and Rich Text inputs.

## Features & Improvements

* Improved accessibility by adding ARIA attributes to the password strength label under the *Password* field.
* Updated the description text for all keys under the *Collections* heading when you open the CloudCannon configuration file in the Data Editor.
* CloudCannon will no longer show the *Recent activity* section on the *Site Dashboard* if you do not have the `site:activity:read` permission.
* CloudCannon now prompts you to regenerate your CloudCannon configuration file if you delete it. The wand icon will reappear next to *Status* in your *Site Navigation* and the *Status* page will allow you to regenerate your CloudCannon configuration file.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon would temporarily display a second copy of a file after renaming a file.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon would incorrectly display a "Waiting for build..." message on Sites in Headless Mode.
* Fixed an issue where users on Client Sharing could not see the Site icon and previews for Bookshop components.
* Fixed an issue where users on Client Sharing could not log in to a Site if it did not have a CloudCannon configuration file.
* Fixed an issue where the options in the *\+ Add* button dropdown in the *Collection browser* did not fall back to use Schemas if `add_options` was configured as an empty array.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, adding text to a Rich Text input, then saving the file, would clear the recently added text.
