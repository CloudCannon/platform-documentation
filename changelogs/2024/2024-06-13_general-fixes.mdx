This release addressed several issues, including those affecting saving files with failing validation, Text editable regions, auto-generated Bookshop structures, Multiselect inputs, sync-triggered builds, and collection filters.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where one file with failing title validation would prevent you from saving other files.
* Fixed an issue where *Enter* or *Shift+Enter* would not create a new line in Text editable regions.
* Fixed an issue where generating the CloudCannon Global Configuration file would duplicate auto-generated Bookshop structures.
* Fixed an issue where Multiselect inputs could display files explicitly excluded from a collection.
* Fixed an issue where a merge triggered by syncing CloudCannon would not trigger a new build.
* Fixed an issue where using `filter: 'strict'` to determine which files are visible in a collection did not respect a `glob` option defined in `collections_config`.
