title: Snippet and Structure picker appearance changes
---
This release improved the appearance of the Snippet and Structure picker modals, updated Data Panel behavior in the Content Editor, and moved the *Enter Legacy* button.

It also addressed several issues, including those affecting filenames in the *Review changes* modal, Code Blocks in Rich Text inputs, automatic detection for templating files, and Site loading.

## Features & Improvements

* Cards in the Snippet picker modal and Structure picker modal now only display a gallery image if the Snippet or Structure has a gallery image or icon configured.
* In the Content Editor, the Data Panel now opens immediately after adding a link, snippet, or image.
* Moved the *Enter CloudCannon Legacy* button from the *App Sidebar* to the *Account Menu*.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where opening the *Review changes* modal would clear the filename of recently added, cloned, or renamed files.
* Fixed an issue where, in the Google Chrome browser, you could not use Code Blocks inside a Rich Text input.
* Fixed an issue where you could not use the *Esc* keyboard key to close the several modals.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon could not automatically detect the URL or find metadata for templating files (e.g., liquid, astro).
* Fixed several issues preventing Sites from loading.
