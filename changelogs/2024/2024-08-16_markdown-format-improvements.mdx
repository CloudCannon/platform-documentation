This release added new checks for table formatting to prevent saving invalid Markdown on Sites using CommonMark.

It also addressed an issue causing CloudCannon to save invalid Markdown attributes.

## Features & Improvements

* CloudCannon now checks that new tables have a single header row when using CommonMark. The controls to remove the header row are disabled to prevent saving invalid Markdown. CloudCannon will now save existing tables without a header row as HTML.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue causing CloudCannon to save invalid Markdown attributes for Hugo sites.
