This release added new behavior for enabling Editing Locked on sites with unsaved changes, and checks for Projects.

It also addressed an issue affecting dropdown menus from the *WYSIWYG toolbar* in rich text inputs.

### Features & Improvements:

* CloudCannon will now prevent you from turning on Editing Locked if your site has unsaved changes.
* Added checks to ensure one Project per git repository per Organization.

### Fixes:

* Fixed an issue causing the bounds of rich text inputs to cut off dropdown menus from the *WYSIWYG toolbar*. When space is limited in a rich text input, dropdown menus will become scrollable.
