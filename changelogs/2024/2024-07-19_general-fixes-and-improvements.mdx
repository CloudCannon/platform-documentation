This release addressed several issues, including pagination of site activity, UX when uploading files in the DAM browser, and site backups failing for large sites.

## Features & Improvements

* Site activity is now paginated, so you can see further into the history of changes to your site.
* The list of users in the Account Authentication settings is also now paginated.
* When uploading a new file in the DAM browser, the new file will now initially appear at the top of the file list, and loading time may be slightly reduced.
* Added a character counter to the form for adding a new custom domain, to properly signal the maximum limit of 62 characters.

## Fixes

* Fixed an incorrect permissions error occurring when triggering a build deploy in some cases.
* Fixed site backups failing for sites over 5 GBs.
* Inline snippets now display correctly inside headings.
* Fixed a bug which prevented Azure assets being selected when no container is configured in the Organization DAM settings.
* Fixed a bug where DAM files could be overwritten without warning in some cases when uploading a new file.
* Options for removing a user from a Client Organization are now correctly hidden if that user is a Partner.
