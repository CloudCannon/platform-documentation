This release added file-level configuration in the global configuration file and better error handling for GitHub app migration.

It also addressed several issues, including those affecting Structures, cropping images, removing members from a Permission Group, and inputs for root-level arrays.

## Features & Improvements

* You can now set file-level configuration outside of the file using `file_config` in the global configuration file.
* Better error handling for GitHub app migration.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the error message incorrectly listed the width dimension twice when you uploaded an image that was too small to crop.
* Fixed an issue where resizing an image using the crop function did not correctly detect its dimensions.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, CloudCannon incorrectly calculated input configuration for inputs containing a structure.
* Fixed an issue where the schema settings for a page could hide some fields in a structure.
* Fixed an issue preventing you from removing a specific Team Member from a Permission Group.
* Fixed an issue preventing you from targeting the root object or array in a file with `_inputs.$`.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, Gitâ€™s automatic garbage collection would break build deploys for large sites.
