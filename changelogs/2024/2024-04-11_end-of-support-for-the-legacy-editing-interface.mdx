This release added a modal for overwriting existing files and improved the speed of large file actions.

It also addressed several issues, including those affecting table controls in rich text inputs, relative URLs for DAMs, text styles and attributes, and requirements for connecting GitHub repositories.

### Features & Improvements:

* Added clearer messaging and a new modal for overwriting existing files when uploading to CloudCannon.
* Improved the speed of large file operations (e.g., cloning, deleting, uploading).

### Fixes:

* Fixed an issue where you could not use the image and link control panels in rich text editors as they appeared stacked on top of each other.
* Fixed an issue where snippets would ignore input configuration outside of the snippet definition.
* Fixed an issue where applying a style to text in a rich text editor would strip other attributes (e.g., links).
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, CloudCannon unformatted editable HTML.
* Fixed an issue causing the table controls dropdown from the *WYSIWYG toolbar* to be cut off by the bound of the rich text input.
* Fixed an issue causing incorrect spacing in the table controls dropdown from the *WYSIWYG toolbar*.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, clicking “Explore existing files” in an image or file input would open a non-existent path in the file browser.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, opening a file but making no edits would appear as an unsaved change.
* Fixed an issue where preview screenshots would not work if the page URL included a special character.
* Fixed an issue where relative URLs for main source DAMs stopped working.
* Fixed the default toolbar options for editable regions in the Visual Editor.
* Updated the requirements for connecting CloudCannon to a GitHub repository. CloudCannon no longer requires the GitHub user who connected the GitHub app to your CloudCannon organization to have access to a repository. Now, CloudCannon only requires the user to be a member of the GitHub Organization to which the repository belongs.
* Added missing inputs in the Configuration GUI.
