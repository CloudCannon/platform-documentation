This release introduced a new login flow for organizations with custom Single-Sign On. It also fixed an issue in which invalid YAML could prevent the CloudCannon config from being applied.

## Features & Improvements

* You will now be redirected to your organization's custom login screen if your account is configured to use SSO, after you enter your email on the normal login screen.

## Fixes

* Duplicate keys in your YAML CloudCannon configuration file no longer prevent your whole configuration from being applied.
