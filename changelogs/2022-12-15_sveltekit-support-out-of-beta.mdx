type: major
---
This release provides increased support for SvelteKit, marking the end of our beta. We've included a fully featured SvelteKit template called Sendit. Along with number of general features and fixes, we've added a feature called [Create Paths](/documentation/articles/set-the-path-for-new-files/) to control where new content files are created, and how they are named.

**Features:**

* Improved the order in the drop down when selecting an SSG.
* Installed .NET SDK on the build environment for Statiq SSG.
* Install latest LTS Node.js (v18) on the build environment.
* Organizations for new user accounts now use the first name provided when created.
* Sendit template for SvelteKit.
* Improved performance during the opening and closing parts of the build process.
* New [Create Path](/documentation/articles/set-the-path-for-new-files/) configuration for collections and schemas to control where new collection files are created and named.

**Fixes:**

* Made file size display for back ups in readable units.
* Fixed input configuration not being read from schemas in some situations.
* Fixed default icon for structure-based items in array inputs.
* Prevent invalid data when creating initial global configuration files.
* Fixed edge case not being able to add new structure-based array item.
* Added default preview text for Snippets to prevent empty boxes.
* Fixed cancel subscription not having two-click confirmation.
