title: SSO and SAML improvements
---
On November 7th, CloudCannon will remove support for the Legacy version of our app. Thank you so much to everyone who provided feedback. We have addressed all issues brought to our attention.

This release added the Authn Context field after SAML configuration and updated the default SAML signing algorithm and SSL minimum TLS version.

## Features & Improvements

* You can now edit the Authn Context field without removing your SAML configuration.
* The default signing algorithm for SAML is now SHA256. Existing SAML configuration using SHA1 is not affected by this change.
* The default Minimum TLS version for SSL is now 1.2. Existing SSL configuration using TLS 1.0 is not affected by this change.
