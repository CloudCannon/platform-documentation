title: Custom install command for Hugo
type: minor
---
This release adds the ability to configure a custom install command for Hugo sites â€“ e.g. if you're using a package manager other than npm. This release also includes several other fixes and improvements.

**Features:**

* The install command for Hugo sites is now configurable.
* The "Urban" Bookshop starter template is now available for Hugo.

**Fixes:**

* The working directory is now reset after a custom build command, for consistency with other build hooks.
* Prevent builds crashing when the output directory has been configured with leading or trailing whitespace.
* Patched some security vulnerabilities.
* Deleting nested snippets no longer invalidates the parent snippet.
* Avoid request timeouts when opening a Cloudinary DAM in the CloudCannon asset browser.
* Fixed an issue preventing boolean keys displaying properly in card preview metadata.
* Migrating Forestry configuration to CloudCannon now adds `remove_extra_inputs: false` and `hide_extra_inputs: true` to schemas, to more closely match Forestry's behaviour for templates.
