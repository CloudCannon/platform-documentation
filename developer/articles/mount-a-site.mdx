You can customize your settings on the *Site Mountings* page.

To mount a site:

1. Open the local site.
2. Navigate to *Site Mountings* under *Site Settings*.
3. Select your *Remote Site*. This site must be within the same Organization as the Local Site.
4. Select your *Remote artifact*, *Remote path*, and *Local path*.
5. Click the *Mount site* button.
6. CloudCannon will add the site to your *Sites mounted* list.
