<comp.Notice info_type="permissions">
  **Permissions required**

  Members of the Developers and Owners [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/), or [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/) with the `site:settings:hosting:write` permission, can add a Custom Domain to a Site.
</comp.Notice>

A  is a unique address used to identify a website (e.g., [cloudcannon.com](https://cloudcannon.com)). If you have [connected a Custom Domain to your Organization](/documentation/developer-articles/connect-a-custom-domain-to-your-organization/), you can host your website content at that web address by adding the Custom Domain to your Site.

&nbsp;

You can host a CloudCannon Site on the base domain (e.g., example.com), a subdomain (e.g., docs.example.com), or a subpath (e.g., example.com/staff/).

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  You can configure both a subdomain and a subpath for each Site on CloudCannon, if your configuration requires them.
</comp.Notice>

These instructions assume you have [connected a Custom Domain to your Organization](/documentation/developer-articles/connect-a-custom-domain-to-your-organization/) and, if you want to host on a subdomain or subpath, that you already have a Site hosted on your base domain.

To add a Custom Domain to your Site:

1. Click the *Sites* button in the *App Sidebar*. CloudCannon will open the *Sites browser*.
2. Identify the Site to which you want to add a Custom Domain and click on the *Site* card. CloudCannon will open the *Dashboard* for that Site.
3. Navigate to the *Custom Domain* page under *Site Settings*.
4. Select the Custom Domain you want to add using the *Base Domain* dropdown.
5. (Optional.) If you want to host your Site on a subdomain or subpath of your Custom Domain, enter the subdomain in the *Subdomain* text field, or the subpath in the *Subpath* text field. Leave these fields blank if you do not want to configure a subdomain or subpath for your Site.
6. Click the *Add a Domain* button.

CloudCannon will begin hosting your website content on your Custom Domain.

You can manage your Custom Domain settings, including subdomains and subpaths, on your Custom Domain's dedicated *Domain* page. To see you Custom Domain's *Domain* page, click on the card for your Custom Domain in the *Domains browser*.

To stop hosting your Site on a Custom Domain, please read our documentation on [removing a Custom Domain from your Site](/documentation/developer-articles/remove-a-custom-domain-from-your-site/).

We also recommend adding an [SSL certificate](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/) to your Site. For more information, please read our documentation on [adding an auto-generated SSL certificate](/documentation/developer-articles/add-an-auto-generated-ssl-certificate/) or [adding a custom SSL certificate](/documentation/developer-articles/add-a-custom-ssl-certificate/).
