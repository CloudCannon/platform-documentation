Learn how to update the details of your connected DAMs.

## Updating your DAM details

To update the details that are stored in CloudCannon for connecting to your DAM:

1. In your Organization settings, navigate to *Files* / *Assets*
2. Locate the relevant DAM, and click the **Manage** button next to its name
3. In the **Configuration tab**, edit your details, then click **Update** to save your changes.

### Limiting size of uploads to your DAM

You can use the **Maximum size for uploaded files** setting to prevent uploads exceeding a pre-determined size. This should be set in bytes. For example, to limit uploads to 1 GB you could set this to 1,000,000,000.


## Updating DAMs connected to your sites

To update the settings for using your DAM, on a site-by-site basis:

1. In your site’s settings, navigate to *Files* / *Assets*.
2. Locate your DAM from the list, and click the three dots in the top right corner.
3. From the context menu, click **Settings**
4. Edit the settings in the modal that appears, then click **Update** to save your changes.

### Prevent uploads to your DAM

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  **Tenovos** DAMs do not support uploading within CloudCannon.
</comp.Notice>

You check the **Uploads Locked** option to prevent your editors from uploading assets to the DAM from within the CloudCannon app. This is set per-site.

### Determine where on the site your DAM can be used

The `allowed_sources` configuration option can allow you to choose which "sources" (i.e. DAMs and site files) are available for different editing interfaces across a single site. To use this, you'll need to set a **Reference Key** in the site-level DAM configuration, which you can then reference in the `allowed_sources` array when configuring your inputs and editable regions.

The configuration might look something like this:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
```
_inputs:
  image:
    options:
      allowed_sources:
        - 'my-cloudinary-dam'
        - 'site-files'
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

The reference key can be any string, except for `site-files` which is reserved to refer to the files from your site. You also cannot have two DAMs with the same reference key on one site.
