Manually scheduled builds are configured in the CloudCannon UI. They are useful for regular period builds or one-off future builds.

To configure a manual build:

1. Go to *Site Settings* / *Schedule*
2. Select the **Manual** tab
3. Add a **name**
4. Enter the **date** and **time** for the build to first run
5. If you want the build to repeat on a regular interval, select a **Repeat Interval**
6. Click **Create Schedule** to create a scheduled build.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Repeat Intervals work from the original date selected. If you select a daily interval and your original time was 2pm, all future builds will run at 2pm.
</comp.Notice>
