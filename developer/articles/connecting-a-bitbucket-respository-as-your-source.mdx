Connecting Bitbucket allows you to work on your websites locally and have the changes sync to CloudCannon. File changes made on CloudCannon also get synced back to Bitbucket.

## Authenticate Bitbucket

Before connecting a repository, you must authenticate your Bitbucket account with CloudCannon:

1. Navigate to *Org Settings* &gt; *Files* &gt; *Bitbucket* &gt; *Authentication* tab.
2. Click the *Authenticate* button.
3. Follow the Bitbucket prompts to authorize CloudCannon.

You only need to authenticate once per *Organization*.

## Create a Site from a Bitbucket repository

Once you have authenticated:

1. Click the *Sites* button in the *App Sidebar* to open the *Sites Browser*.
2. Click *Create a Site*.
3. Select *Bitbucket repository* from the *File source* dropdown.
4. Use the *Repository* dropdown to select a repository.
5. Choose a branch using the *Branch setup* section.
6. Enter a name for your *Site* and click *Create Site and start syncing*.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Any existing files on your website will be replaced with the contents of the selected repository. Click *Create Site and start syncing* to continue, or exit the page to cancel the process.
</comp.Notice>

Bitbucket is now connected. Changes you push to the Git repository are pulled in by CloudCannon. Any changes made on CloudCannon are automatically committed and pushed.

## View connected Sites

The *Sites* tab shows all *Sites* in your *Organization* that use Bitbucket as their file source. Navigate to *Org Settings* &gt; *Files* &gt; *Bitbucket* &gt; *Sites* tab to view them.

## Unauthenticate Bitbucket

If you need to revoke CloudCannon's access to your Bitbucket account:

1. Navigate to *Org Settings* &gt; *Files* &gt; *Bitbucket* &gt; *Authentication* tab.
2. Click the *Unauthenticate* button.

Unauthenticating removes CloudCannon's access token for Bitbucket. Existing *Sites* retain their files and configuration, but future syncs will fail with a provider error until you re-authenticate. Your *Site* repository and branch settings are preserved, so re-authenticating restores syncing without needing to reconfigure each *Site*.

## Upgrade Bitbucket integration

If your *Organization* uses an older version of the Bitbucket integration, an *Upgrade* tab will appear in the Bitbucket settings.

1. Navigate to *Org Settings* &gt; *Files* &gt; *Bitbucket* &gt; *Upgrade* tab.
2. Click *Upgrade Bitbucket integration* to begin the migration.

The newer integration improves security and reliability. Existing *Sites* continue working during and after the upgrade.
