<comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/b/build.yml">Building</comp.GlossaryTerm> is when CloudCannon converts all your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site.yml">Site</comp.GlossaryTerm> files into a single, functional website. *Building* through CloudCannon is optional; however, extra features are available if you enable *Building*. This includes preview screenshots of your pages in the *Collection Browser*, a [Testing Domain](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-testing-domain/) and [Custom Domain](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/), and the [Visual Editor](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-visual-editor/).

Articles in this section are useful for developers responsible for configuring and managing Site builds in CloudCannon.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Building is an optional step. If your Site is dynamic, or you only want to use CloudCannon as a CMS for your Git repository, you don’t need to build.
</comp.Notice>

In the Building section of our Developer documentation, we cover:

* Configure your builds — Learn how to set up and manage your build settings
* Extend your builds — Learn how to add more functions to your build
* Schedule your builds — Learn how to schedule builds manually or automatically
* Output Files and URLs — Learn how CloudCannon matches output files to source files
* Headless Mode — Learn how to use CloudCannon as a CMS without building or hosting
* Site Mounting — Learn how to make files from one Site available to another at build time

Let’s briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## Configure your builds

CloudCannon needs to know a few details about your Site to build it, such as which <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/ssg.yml">SSG</comp.GlossaryTerm> you are using and what commands to run. You can manage these settings on the *Site Details* and *Build Configuration* pages under *Site Settings*.

For a more in-depth explanation of build configuration, please read our documentation:

* [Configure your first build](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-your-first-build/)
* [Select your SSG](/documentation/developer-articles/select-your-ssg/)
* [Configure your command line options](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-your-command-line-options/)
* [Configure your environment variables](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-your-environment-variables/)
* [Pin your dependency version](/documentation/developer-articles/pin-your-dependency-version/)
* [Lock builds for your Site](/documentation/developer-articles/lock-builds-for-your-site/)

## Extend your builds

You can add more functions to your build to collect information from your Site, improve your build time, and more.

For a more in-depth explanation of the various ways you can extend your build, please read our documentation:

* [Build hooks](/documentation/developer-articles/extending-your-build-process-with-hooks/)
* [Including the .git folder](/documentation/developer-articles/including-git-folder-in-your-build/)
* [Initial Site settings](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-your-initial-site-settings/)
* [Committing build files](/documentation/developer-articles/saving-files-from-your-build-back-to-your-source/)
* [Configure caching between builds](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-caching-between-builds/)
* [Optimize your Site](/documentation/developer-articles/optimize-your-site/)

## Schedule your builds

Scheduling a build lets you edit your Site when you have time and release your changes later.

For a more in-depth explanation of build scheduling, please read our documentation:

* [Schedule your builds manually](/documentation/developer-articles/scheduling-your-builds-manually/)
* [Schedule your builds automatically](/documentation/developer-articles/scheduling-your-next-build-automatically/)

## Output Files and URLs

When you build your *Site*, your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/ssg.yml">SSG</comp.GlossaryTerm> creates the output files your visitors see on the Internet. CloudCannon uses these output files for the *Visual Editor* preview and *Collection Browser* screenshots. You can configure how CloudCannon matches output files to source files and controls output URLs for collections.

For a more in-depth explanation of output files and URLs, please read our documentation:

* [What is an output file?](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-an-output-file/)
* [Update the output URL for a collection](/documentation/developer-articles/update-the-output-url-for-a-collection/)
* [Disable output URL matching for a collection](/documentation/developer-articles/disable-output-url-matching-for-a-collection/)

## Headless Mode

If you don't want to build your *Site* in CloudCannon, you can enable *Headless Mode*. This disables building and hosting on CloudCannon while still allowing CloudCannon to manage your content.

For a more in-depth explanation of Headless Mode, please read our documentation:

* [What is Headless Mode?](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-headless-mode/)
* [Enable Headless Mode](/documentation/developer-articles/enable-headless-mode/)

## Site Mounting

<comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site-mounting.yml">Site Mounting</comp.GlossaryTerm> makes files from one or more CloudCannon *Sites* available to another *Site* at build time, allowing you to share resources and trigger builds when the resources are updated.

For a more in-depth explanation of *Site Mounting*, please read our documentation:

* [What is Site Mounting?](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-site-mounting/)
* [Mount a Site](/documentation/developer-articles/mount-a-site/)
* [Remove a mounted Site](/documentation/developer-articles/remove-a-mounted-site/)
