A <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/b/build.yml">build</comp.GlossaryTerm> is when CloudCannon converts all your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site.yml">Site</comp.GlossaryTerm> files into a single, functional website. Building your Site in CloudCannon enables you to check all your files function well together, preview screenshots of your pages in the [Collection](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-collection/) browser, view a preview of your Site live on a [Testing Domain](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-testing-domain/) and [Custom Domain](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/), and use the [Visual Editor](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-visual-editor/) for an intuitive editing experience.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Building is an optional step. If your Site is dynamic, or you only want to use CloudCannon as a CMS for your Git repository, you don’t need to build.
</comp.Notice>

Articles in this section are useful for developers responsible for configuring and managing Site builds in CloudCannon.

In the Building section of our Developer documentation, we cover:

* Site builds — Learn about the basics of Site building, including when to build, how to trigger a build, and how to read build logs
* Configuring your builds — Learn how to set up and manage your build settings
* Extending your builds — Learn how to add more functions to your build
* Scheduling your builds — Learn how to schedule builds manually or automatically
* Output Files and URLs — Learn how CloudCannon matches output files to source files
* Headless Mode — Learn how to use CloudCannon as a CMS without building or hosting
* Site Mounting — Learn how to make files from one Site available to another at build time
* Plugins — Learn how to manage build plugins manually when needed

Let’s briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## Configuring your builds

CloudCannon needs to know a few details about your Site to build it, such as which <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/ssg.yml">SSG</comp.GlossaryTerm> you are using and what commands to run. You can manage these settings on the *Site Details* and *Build Configuration* pages under *Site Settings*.

For a more in-depth explanation of build configuration, including how to set up your first build, manage your build settings, or lock builds, please read our documentation:

* [Configure your first build](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-your-first-build/)
* [Select your SSG](/documentation/developer-articles/select-your-ssg/)
* [Configure your command line options](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-your-command-line-options/)
* [Configure your environment variables](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-your-environment-variables/)
* [Pin your dependency version](/documentation/developer-articles/pin-your-dependency-version/)
* [Lock builds for your Site](/documentation/developer-articles/lock-builds-for-your-site/)

## Extending your builds

You can add more functions to your build to collect information from your Site, improve your build time, and more.

For a more in-depth explanation of the various ways you can extend your build, including adding build hooks and caching, please read our documentation:

* [Build hooks](/documentation/developer-articles/extending-your-build-process-with-hooks/)
* [Including the .git folder](/documentation/developer-articles/including-git-folder-in-your-build/)
* [Initial Site settings](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-your-initial-site-settings/)
* [Committing build files](/documentation/developer-articles/saving-files-from-your-build-back-to-your-source/)
* [Configure caching between builds](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-caching-between-builds/)
* [Optimize your Site](/documentation/developer-articles/optimize-your-site/)

## Scheduling your builds

Scheduling a build allows you to edit your Site when you have the time and release your changes in the future.

For a more in-depth explanation of build scheduling, including manual vs automatic scheduling, please read our documentation:

* [Schedule your builds manually](/documentation/developer-articles/scheduling-your-builds-manually/)
* [Schedule your builds automatically](/documentation/developer-articles/scheduling-your-next-build-automatically/)

## Site Mounting

<comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site-mounting.yml">Site Mounting</comp.GlossaryTerm> makes one site dependent on one or more other CloudCannon sites. Files from a remote site will be accessible to the local site at build time, and any updates to the remote site will trigger a build of the local site.

For a more in-depth explanation of Site Mounting, including how to add and remove Mounted Sites, please read our documentation:

* [What is Site Mounting?](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-site-mounting/)
* [Mount a Site](/documentation/developer-articles/mount-a-site/)
* [Remove a mounted Site](/documentation/developer-articles/remove-a-mounted-site/)

## Output Files and URLs

When you build your Site, your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/ssg.yml">SSG</comp.GlossaryTerm> creates output files that visitors see on the Internet. CloudCannon uses these output files for the Visual Editor preview and Collection Browser screenshots. You can configure how CloudCannon matches output files to source files and controls output URLs for collections.

For a more in-depth explanation of output files and URLs, please read our documentation:

* [What is an output file?](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-an-output-file/)
* [Update the output URL for a collection](/documentation/developer-articles/update-the-output-url-for-a-collection/)
* [Disable output URL matching for a collection](/documentation/developer-articles/disable-output-url-matching-for-a-collection/)

## Headless Mode

If you don't want to build your Site in CloudCannon, you can enable Headless Mode. This disables building and hosting on CloudCannon while still allowing CloudCannon to manage your content. Headless Mode is useful when you use an external build and hosting setup.

For a more in-depth explanation of Headless Mode, please read our documentation:

* [What is Headless Mode?](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-headless-mode/)
* [Enable Headless Mode](/documentation/developer-articles/enable-headless-mode/)

## Plugins

CloudCannon injects build plugins (such as the Eleventy plugin) by default. If this clashes with your build, you can manage plugins manually to control how they are installed and configured.

For a more in-depth explanation of managing build plugins, please read our documentation:

* [How to manage the build plugin manually in Eleventy](/documentation/developer-articles/how-to-manage-the-build-plugin-manually-in-eleventy/)
