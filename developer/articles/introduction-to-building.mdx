A <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/b/build.yml">build</comp.GlossaryTerm> is when CloudCannon converts all your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site.yml">Site</comp.GlossaryTerm> files into a single, functional website. Building your Site in CloudCannon enables you to check all your files function well together, preview screenshots of your pages in the [Collection](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-collection/) browser, view a preview of your Site live on a [Testing Domain](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-testing-domain/) and [Custom Domain](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/), and use the [Visual Editor](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-visual-editor/) for an intuitive editing experience.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Building is an optional step. If your Site is dynamic, or you only want to use CloudCannon as a CMS for your Git repository, you don’t need to build.
</comp.Notice>

In the Building section of our documentation, we cover:

* [What is a Site build?](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-a-site-build/) — Learn about the basics of Site building, including when to build, how to trigger a build, and how to read build logs.
* [Configuring your builds](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-your-first-build/) — Set up and manage your build settings.
* Extending your builds — Add more functions to your build.
* Scheduling your builds — Learn how to schedule builds [manually](/documentation/developer-articles/scheduling-your-builds-manually/) or [automatically](/documentation/developer-articles/scheduling-your-next-build-automatically/).
* [Site Mounting](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-site-mounting/) — Make files from one Site available to another at build time.

Let’s briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## Configuring your builds

CloudCannon needs to know a few details about your Site to build it, such as which <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/ssg.yml">SSG</comp.GlossaryTerm> you are using and what commands to run. You can manage these settings on the *Site Details* and *Build Configuration* pages under *Site Settings*.

For a more in-depth explanation of build configuration, including how to set up your first build, manage your build settings, or lock builds, please read our documentation:

* [Configure your first build](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-your-first-build/)
* [Select your SSG](/documentation/developer-articles/select-your-ssg/)
* [Configure your command line options](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-your-command-line-options/)
* [Configure your environment variables](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-your-environment-variables/)
* [Pin your dependency version](/documentation/developer-articles/pin-your-dependency-version/)
* [Lock builds for your Site](/documentation/developer-articles/lock-builds-for-your-site/)

## Extending your builds

You can add more functions to your build to collect information from your Site, improve your build time, and more.

For a more in-depth explanation of the various ways you can extend your build, including adding build hooks and caching, please read our documentation:

* [Build hooks](/documentation/developer-articles/extending-your-build-process-with-hooks/)
* [Including the .git folder](/documentation/developer-articles/including-git-folder-in-your-build/)
* [Initial Site settings](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-your-initial-site-settings/)
* [Committing build files](/documentation/developer-articles/saving-files-from-your-build-back-to-your-source/)
* [Configure caching between builds](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-caching-between-builds/)
* [Optimize your Site](/documentation/developer-articles/optimize-your-site/)

## Scheduling your builds

Scheduling a build allows you to edit your Site when you have the time and release your changes in the future.

For a more in-depth explanation of build scheduling, including manual vs automatic scheduling, please read our documentation:

* [Schedule your builds manually](/documentation/developer-articles/scheduling-your-builds-manually/)
* [Schedule your builds automatically](/documentation/developer-articles/scheduling-your-next-build-automatically/)

## Site Mounting

<comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site-mounting.yml">Site Mounting</comp.GlossaryTerm> makes one site dependent on one or more other CloudCannon sites. Files from a remote site will be accessible to the local site at build time, and any updates to the remote site will trigger a build of the local site.

For a more in-depth explanation of Site Mounting, including how to add and remove Mounted Sites, please read our documentation:
