Your source <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/f/file.yml">files</comp.GlossaryTerm> are the most important part of any <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site.yml">Site</comp.GlossaryTerm> on CloudCannon. They hold the content, data and code to power your chosen static site generator (<comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/ssg.yml">SSG</comp.GlossaryTerm>). These files are extremely important to keep backed up with the changes made to them tracked. This is why the majority of the software development world uses <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/g/git.yml">Git</comp.GlossaryTerm>, which offers all we need to keep our files safe and up to date. Git enables teams to work together on a set of files (a repository) with inbuilt conflict resolution, branching/merging, and accountability.

Syncing in CloudCannon refers to a two-way connection to your own <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/g/git-repository.yml">Git repository</comp.GlossaryTerm>. The goal with syncing is to:

1. Connect a branch of your repository to a Site and pull in your files
2. Run a <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/b/build.yml">build</comp.GlossaryTerm> on those files (Covered under Building)
3. Produce an editing and <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/h/hosting.yml">hosting</comp.GlossaryTerm> environment that enables non-developers to contribute to your code and content

Once connected, any change pushed to your repository will be synced to CloudCannon, and any saves made on CloudCannon will push back to your repository. This allows the whole team to contribute to your Git repository in a way that they are comfortable. Developers get to use their local environment to build with their own tools. Everyone else gets a nice visual editing interface through CloudCannon which can be optimized to their workflows by the Developers. Everyone is happy with the benefits of Git baked in.

In the Syncing section of our documentation, we cover:

* [Git Providers](/documentation/developer-articles/connecting-a-github-repository-as-your-source/) — connect your repository from GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
* [Authenticate your Git provider](/documentation/developer-articles/authenticate-your-git-provider/) — authorize CloudCannon to access your repository.
* [Enable Git LFS](/documentation/developer-articles/enable-git-lfs/) — use Git Large File Storage for large files.
* [Backups](/documentation/developer-articles/creating-backups-of-your-source-files/) — create backups of your source files.
* [Syncing Errors](/documentation/developer-articles/resolve-syncing-errors/) — resolve syncing errors when they occur.

Let's briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## Publishing, Merging and Pull requests

Most repositories have a main branch which stores the main version of the code. Some repositories have other branches which separate changes from the main branch. Bringing these changes into the main can be done in two ways:

1. [Merging](/documentation/developer-articles/merging-and-pull-requests/): A direct <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/m/merge.yml">merge</comp.GlossaryTerm> with no review process.
2. [Pull requests](/documentation/developer-articles/merging-and-pull-requests/): An audit flow built into Git providers that requires reviewers and automated testing to pass.

On CloudCannon this feature is called Publishing. This can be configured to match how your team uses Git.

For a more in-depth explanation of publishing, including how merging and pull requests work, please read our documentation:

* [Merging and pull requests](/documentation/developer-articles/merging-and-pull-requests/)

## Branching

Sites are connected to a single branch on a repository. For branching we need to set up a home for the entire repository. In CloudCannon, this home is called a <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/p/project.yml">Project</comp.GlossaryTerm>.

[Projects](/documentation/developer-articles/create-a-project/) allow you to configure branching and have a high level overview of the Sites that are using the same repository. Creating a project allows the rest of the team to create new branches. These newly created branches are connected to a Site and built using the predefined build settings. New Sites are configured to publish back to the branch they were originally created from.

For a more in-depth explanation of branching and Projects, please read our documentation:

* [Create a Project](/documentation/developer-articles/create-a-project/)

## Supported Git Providers

CloudCannon supports a wide range of cloud and self-hosted options. If you don't see your Git solution available, be sure to ask support or your sales representative.

For a more in-depth explanation of connecting your repository, please read our documentation:

* [GitHub Cloud](/documentation/developer-articles/connecting-a-github-repository-as-your-source/) and [GitHub Enterprise](/documentation/developer-articles/connecting-a-github-enterprise-server-repository-as-your-source/)
* [GitLab Cloud](/documentation/developer-articles/connecting-a-gitlab-respository-as-your-source/) and [GitLab Self-hosted](/documentation/developer-articles/connecting-a-self-hosted-gitlab-repository-as-your-source/)
* [Bitbucket](/documentation/developer-articles/connecting-a-bitbucket-respository-as-your-source/)
