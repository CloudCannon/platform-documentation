CloudCannon is a <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/g/git.yml">Git-backed</comp.GlossaryTerm> <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/c/cms.yml">Content Management Software</comp.GlossaryTerm>, allowing you to store your website source files securely on a *Git Provider*. CloudCannon will automatically <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/syncing.yml">Sync</comp.GlossaryTerm> your files whenever you create a *Site*, trigger a *Sync*, or your website files are updated via CloudCannon or an IDE. This means that no matter what software your team uses, everyone always has access to the latest version of your files.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  You can upload your website files directly from your local storage, but we highly recommend using a *Git Provider* like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
</comp.Notice>

In the Syncing section of our Developer documentation, we cover:

* Git — Learn how to get your website files from your *Git Repository* onto CloudCannon
* Direct Upload — Learn how to upload your website files from local storage to CloudCannon
* Syncing Errors — Learn how to resolve *Syncing Errors* when CloudCannon detects that incoming changes conflict with recently saved content

Let's briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## Git

CloudCannon supports several cloud and self-hosted *Git Providers*. You can authenticate your provider, control which repository a *Site* syncs from, and enable large file storage for faster syncing.

For a more in-depth explanation of *Git* in CloudCannon, please read our documentation:

* [Authenticate your Git Provider](/documentation/developer-articles/authenticate-your-git-provider/)
* [Connect a GitHub Enterprise Server](/documentation/developer-articles/connecting-a-github-enterprise-server-repository-as-your-source/)
* [Connect a self-hosted GitLab repository](/documentation/developer-articles/connecting-a-self-hosted-gitlab-repository-as-your-source/)
* [Enable Git LFS](/documentation/developer-articles/enable-git-lfs/)

## Direct Upload

Although not technically syncing, you can upload your website files directly from your local storage when you create a Site. You can still use the majority of CloudCannon's features, except for *Syncing* and *Publishing*.

For a more in-depth explanation of connecting your repository, please read our documentation:

* [Add files with Direct Upload](/documentation/developer-articles/create-a-site-with-direct-upload/)

## Syncing Errors

CloudCannon will [pause automatic syncing](/documentation/user-articles/why-is-syncing-paused/) when incoming changes from your *Git Repository* conflict with unsaved changes on your CloudCannon *Site*. If saving those changes doesn't resolve this issue, there are several solutions for *Syncing Errors*.

For a more in-depth explanation of connecting your repository, please read our documentation:

* [Resolve Syncing Errors](/documentation/developer-articles/resolve-syncing-errors/)
