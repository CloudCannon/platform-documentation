A “build” is when CloudCannon converts all your Site files into a single, functional website. By building your Site in CloudCannon, you can make the most of features such as:

* [The Visual Editor](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-visual-editor/)
* Preview screenshots for pages in your [Collection](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-collection/) browser
* The [Testing Domain](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-testing-domain/)
* Hosting your Site on a [Custom Domain](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/)

## What happens during a build?

CloudCannon uses a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) system. Every time you trigger a build of your Site, CloudCannon will:

1. Download your files onto our server.
2. Run your selected install commands (e.g., `npm install`, `bundle install`).
3. Run your selected build commands (e.g., `npm run build`).
4. Index your output files.
5. Upload your output files to CloudCannon to generate previews (i.e., the test domain, visual editor, and in-app screenshots) and deliver them to your live domain (if you are [hosting with CloudCannon](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-cloudcannon-dns/)).

Additionally, you can [configure build hooks](/documentation/developer-articles/extending-your-build-process-with-hooks/) to run extra commands during your Site build. Build hooks are useful for downloading external data, running test commands, and more.

CloudCannon runs your build commands using `bash` in an isolated environment powered by `Ubuntu`. In addition to bash, CloudCannon includes several other programs and libraries your Site may need, such as Deno, Go, Node.js, and Ruby. You can [pin a version of these dependencies](/documentation/developer-articles/pin-your-dependency-version/) to maintain consistency between builds.

## Starting a build

<comp.Notice info_type="permissions">
  <p><strong>Permissions required</strong></p><p>Members of the Owners, Developers, or Technical Editors <a href="/documentation/user-articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/">Default Permission Groups</a>, or <a href="/documentation/developer-articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/">Custom Permission Groups</a> with the <code>site:build</code> (or, more specifically, <code>site:build:trigger</code>) permission, can trigger a <em>Site</em> build.</p>
</comp.Notice>

Setting up your first Site build requires some configuration. For more information, please read our documentation on [configuring your first build](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-your-first-build/). Once you have completed your first build you can trigger subsequent builds at any time.

You can start a build by:

* Committing edits to your Git repository after [editing your files](/documentation/user-articles/edit-your-files/) in CloudCannon or locally
* Updating your build configuration, such as your [SSG](/documentation/developer-articles/select-your-ssg/), [command line options](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-your-command-line-options/), [caching options](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-caching-between-builds/), or [unlocking builds on your Site](/documentation/developer-articles/lock-builds-for-your-site/).
* Clicking the *Rebuild* button on the *Summary* tab of your *Site Dashboard*.
* Configuring [manual build scheduling](/documentation/developer-articles/scheduling-your-builds-manually/) or [automatic build scheduling](/documentation/developer-articles/scheduling-your-next-build-automatically/).
* Using the CloudCannon API.

<comp.Notice info_type="pricing">
  **This feature is available through a private Beta.**

  The CloudCannon API is currently available through a private Beta. Want to chat about whether this feature is right for you? Our support team is always <a href="mailto:success@cloudcannon.com?subject=A%20question%20about%20the%20CloudCannon%20API" rel="noreferrer">happy to hear from you</a>.
</comp.Notice>

You can prevent a Site from building by [locking builds](/documentation/developer-articles/lock-builds-for-your-site/).

## Reading your build output logs

CloudCannon produces a log every time it runs a build. You can use your build log to follow CloudCannon's build process and diagnose your build if CloudCannon runs into an error.

While CloudCannon is building your Site, you can read the build output files by clicking on the *View Output* button in the notification at the bottom right of the app. This will open the build terminal.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/builds/what-is-a-build/2024-08/CloudCannon-Documentation-Build-Terminal-Modal.png" alt="A screenshot of the Content Editor with the Build Terminal modal open shows the progress of the current Site build." title="The Build Terminal modal" type="screenshot"/>

The build terminal has three tools: the *Copy Output* button and the checkboxes for *Scroll to bottom* and *Show timing*. The *Copy Output* button lets you copy your build log as plain text. The status of the *Scroll to bottom* and *Show timing* checkboxes will persist between builds. These checkboxes control whether the terminal displays the beginning or the end of the log by default and whether event times are logged, respectively.

You can view all your build logs on the *Builds* tab of your *Site Dashboard*.

## Caching between builds

To improve the speed of your builds, CloudCannon attempts to send consecutive builds from a single Site to the same server. You can configure file caching so that CloudCannon only uses server time for files updated between builds. This allows you to skip expensive and repetitive operations.

Caching is great for minimizing the effect of build steps that are typically slow, such as image optimization, installing dependencies, and external data fetching. For more information, please read our documentation on [configuring caching between builds](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-caching-between-builds/).
