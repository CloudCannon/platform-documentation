Accounts in CloudCannon are organized around <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/o/organization.yml">Organizations</comp.GlossaryTerm>. An Organization is the top-level container for your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site.yml">Sites</comp.GlossaryTerm>, <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/t/team-member.yml">team members</comp.GlossaryTerm>, and <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/b/billing.yml">billing</comp.GlossaryTerm>. As a Developer, you may need to create Organizations for clients, transfer Sites between Organizations, or manage account-level security settings.

Articles in this section are useful for developers responsible for setting up *Organizations*, managing client accounts, or configuring account-level security.

In the Accounts section of our Developer documentation, we cover:

* Organizations — Learn how to create and manage *Organizations*, and transfer Sites between them
* Partner Program — Learn how to manage web agency clients in CloudCannon

Let's briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## Organizations

*Organizations* are the billing unit in CloudCannon, containing all your *Sites*, *Team Members*, and *Custom Domains*. When you create a CloudCannon account, CloudCannon will automatically make you an *Organization* on a free trial; however, you can create and be a member of as many *Organizations* as you want.

For a more in-depth explanation of *Organizations*, please read our documentation:

* [Creating a new Organization](/documentation/developer-articles/creating-a-new-organization/)
* [Transferring Sites between Organizations](/documentation/developer-articles/transferring-sites-between-organizations/)

## Partner Program

CloudCannon's [Partner Program](/partner-program/) is designed for agencies to manage client websites while providing independent editing and billing. As a member of the *Partner Program* you will have access to exclusive features to make managing several *Organizations* easier.

For a more in-depth explanation of the Partner Program in app, please read our documentation:

* [Create a Client Organization](/documentation/developer-articles/create-a-client-organization/)
