An output URL is the URL your SSG outputs your files to during a [Site build](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-site-build/).  After each successful build, CloudCannon automatically determines the likely output URL to match an [output file](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-output-file/) to a source file, enabling the [Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-visual-editor/) and screenshots in the *Collection Browser*.

If CloudCannon has incorrectly determined the output URL for your source files, you may notice the wrong webpage screenshot in the gallery section of your *File Cards* (or no screenshot), or that the *Visual Editor* opens to an incorrect webpage. To fix this issue, you can explicitly specify the output URL for each *Collection* using a template string.

To update the output URL CloudCannon uses to match a output files to source files:

1. Navigate to the *Collection* for which you want to update the output URL CloudCannon uses.
2. Turn on *Configuration Mode* using the switch on the right of the *Site Header*. Purple *Edit Configuration* buttons will appear in the *Collection Browser*.
3. Click the *Edit Advanced* in the top right of the *Collection Browser*. CloudCannon will open the *Edit Advanced* data panel.
4. Identify the *URL* text field and enter the template string for the correct output URL.
5. Save the change to your *Site*.

CloudCannon will automatically update which output URL it uses to match output files to source files for that *Collection*.

## Template string placeholders

You can use a template string to define the correct output URL for matching output files in a *Collection*. Template strings allow you to use placeholders as well as plain text.

You can use fixed or data placeholders, and filters to modify the value of data placeholders, allowing you to reference structured data from your files to create the correct URL format.

### Fixed placeholders

The following fixed placeholders are available for your output URL template string:

* `[filename]` — Populated by the original filename including the file extension.
* `[slug]` — Populated by the original filename excluding the file extension. If the filename is "index", this will result in an empty string.
* `[relative_path]` — Populated by the original file name including the file extension, relative to the *Collection* path.
* `[relative_base_path]` — Populated by the original file name excluding the file extension, relative to the *Collection* path.
* `[full_slug]` — An alias for the template path `[relative_base_path]/[slug]`.
* `[path]` — Populated by the original file name including the file extension, relative to your *Site* source.
* `[base_path]` — Populated by the original file name excluding the file extension, relative to your *Site* source.
* `[collection]` — Populated by the key for the *Collection* to which the file belongs.
* `[ext]` — Populated by the last file extension in the original file path.

Let's go through an example.

The `url` template string `/[relative_bath_path]/[slug]/` for our "Pages" *Collection* will resolve to the following output URLs:

* The file `/pages/index.md` becomes the output URL `/` (e.g., a Home landing page).
* The file `/pages/about.md` becomes the output URL `/about`.
* The file `/pages/contact/index.md` becomes the output URL `/contact/`.
* The file `/pages/contact/book-an-appointment.md` becomes the output URL `/contact/book-an-appointment`

### Data placeholders

You can reference any front matter field from your file in your output URL template string by using the key name in curly brackets (e.g., `{key}`).

You can also apply filters to your data placeholders by using the `|` character after your front matter key name, followed by the name of the filter.

Let's go through an example.

The `url` template string `/news/{date|year}/{date|month}-{date|day}_{title|slugify}/` for our "News" *Collection* will resolve to the following output URLs:

* The file `/news/our-next-feature.md` with the front matter fields `title: Our next feature!` and `date:05/11/2026` becomes the output URL `/2026/05-11_our-next-feature`.

For a complete list of filters available for data placeholders in your output URL template string, please read our documentation on [template strings](/documentation/articles/configure-your-template-strings/).
