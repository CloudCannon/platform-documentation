You can configure CloudCannon to commit built/generated files back to your source repository. This ensures that any generated files are consistent between CloudCannon and your source repository.

For example, if your site uses `npm`, you may want to automatically commit `package-lock.json` to your repository whenever it changes (e.g., by updating `package.json`).

### SYNC\_PATHS

To configure file updates:

1. Navigate to *Site Settings* / *Build*
2. Add a new environment variable called `CLOUDCANNON_SYNC_PATHS`.
3. Add a comma-separated list of files and/or folders.

CloudCannon will use the value of this variable to determine which file's updates should be committed when your site builds. If you set a folder to be updated its entire contents will also be updated.
