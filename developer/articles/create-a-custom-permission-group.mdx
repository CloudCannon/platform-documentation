</comp.Notice>

To create a custom [Permission Group](/documentation/user-articles/what-are-permission-groups/) in your [Organization](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-an-organization/):

1. Navigate to the *Team* page under *Org settings*.
2. Click on the *Groups* tab.
3. Under the *Groups* tab, click on the *\+ Add new Group* button in the top right to open the *Create a new Group* page.
4. Enter the name of the Custom Permission Group.
5. Click the *Add permission* button to open the *Add permission* modal.
6. Select the scope for this permission using the *Scope* dropdown. If you select Base Domain, Group, Project, or Site, you must also choose the Target to that scope with the *Target* dropdown. Selecting a scope will automatically filter the resource tree.
7. Using the resource tree, select the resources you want to add and what actions you want to allow for each resource (i.e., Read, Write, or Create).
8. Click the *Add* button.
9. Repeat steps five to eight until you have added all the permissions you require.
10. If you want to include any [exceptions](/documentation/developer-articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/#exceptions) in your Permission Group, click the *Add exception* button to open the *Add exception* modal.
11. Select the scope, target (if applicable), and resources for your exception.
12. Click the *Add* button.
13. Repeat steps ten to twelve until you have added all the exceptions you require.
14. Click the *Create group* button.

CloudCannon will add the new Permission Group to the *Groups* tab on the *Team* page. You are now able to [add team members to your custom permission group](/documentation/developer-articles/add-a-team-member-to-a-permission-group/).

For more information, including a list of all available permissions, read our reference documentation on [permissions](/documentation/developer-articles/permissions-reference/).
