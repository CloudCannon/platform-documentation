<comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site.yml">Sites</comp.GlossaryTerm> in CloudCannon are where your content lives. Each Site connects to a branch of your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/g/git-repository.yml">Git repository</comp.GlossaryTerm> and provides an editing environment for your team. Understanding how Sites work is essential for configuring CloudCannon to match your workflow.

CloudCannon Sites are highly configurable. You can customize how your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/c/collection.yml">collections</comp.GlossaryTerm> appear, which editing interfaces your team uses, how new <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/f/file.yml">files</comp.GlossaryTerm> are created, and what appears in your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site-navigation.yml">Site Navigation</comp.GlossaryTerm>. All of this is controlled through configuration files stored in your repository.

In the Sites section of our documentation, we cover:

* [CloudCannon Configuration Files](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-the-cloudcannon-configuration-file/) — learn about the configuration file at the heart of your CloudCannon experience.
* [Create your configuration file](/documentation/developer-articles/create-your-cloudcannon-configuration-file/) — set up your first configuration file.
* [Configuration Mode](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-configuration-mode/) — configure your Site using the CloudCannon <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/u/ui.yml">UI</comp.GlossaryTerm>.
* [Collections](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-collection/) — define groups of content files for your Site.
* [Configure your collections](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-your-collections/) — customize how collections appear and behave.
* [Card previews](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-your-card-previews/) — control how collection items appear in the browser.
* [Flags](/documentation/developer-articles/what-are-flags/) — use configuration options to customize behavior.

Let's briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## CloudCannon Configuration Files

The CloudCannon Configuration File is the heart of your Site customization. It allows you to define collections, configure editing interfaces, set up Site Navigation, and control how new files are created. Your configuration file can be JSON, YAML, or YML format.

For a more in-depth explanation of the configuration file, including how to create and customize it, please read our documentation:

* [What is the CloudCannon Configuration File?](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-the-cloudcannon-configuration-file/)
* [Create your CloudCannon configuration file](/documentation/developer-articles/create-your-cloudcannon-configuration-file/)

## Configuration Mode

<comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/c/configuration-mode.yml">Configuration Mode</comp.GlossaryTerm> provides a visual interface for configuring your Site. You can use it to modify settings without editing configuration files directly, making it easier to experiment with different options.

For a more in-depth explanation of Configuration Mode, please read our documentation:

* [What is Configuration Mode?](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-configuration-mode/)
* [Using the configuration cascade](/documentation/developer-articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/)

## Collections

<comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/c/collection.yml">Collections</comp.GlossaryTerm> are groups of related files with a repeated format. They form the foundation of how content is organized in CloudCannon. You might have a collection for blog posts, team members, or product pages.

For a more in-depth explanation of Collections, including how to configure and customize them, please read our documentation:

* [What is a collection?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-collection/)
* [Configure your collections](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-your-collections/)
* [Set a default editing interface](/documentation/developer-articles/set-a-default-editing-interface/)

## Cards

<comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/c/card.yml">Cards</comp.GlossaryTerm> are the visual previews of collection items in the CloudCannon interface. You can configure how cards display information, including which fields appear and how they are formatted.

For a more in-depth explanation of card configuration, please read our documentation:

* [Configure your card previews](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-your-card-previews/)

## Flags

<comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/f/flags.yml">Flags</comp.GlossaryTerm> are configuration options that control specific behaviors in CloudCannon. They allow you to fine-tune how your Site works, from <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/i/input.yml">input</comp.GlossaryTerm> behavior to editing interface options.

For a more in-depth explanation of Flags, please read our documentation:

* [What are Flags?](/documentation/developer-articles/what-are-flags/)
