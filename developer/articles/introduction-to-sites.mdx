You can edit content on CloudCannon through <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site.yml">Sites</comp.GlossaryTerm>. Each *Site* is connected to a *Branch* in your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/g/git-repository.yml">Git Repository</comp.GlossaryTerm> and you can connect multiple *Sites* to a single *Branch*. You can customize the appearance and function of each *Site* to create the editing experience best suited to your team.

Articles in this section provide information about the *CloudCannon Configuration File* and are useful for developers responsible for customizing CloudCannon.

In the Sites section of our Developer documentation, we cover:

* CloudCannon Configuration Files — Learn about the configuration file at the heart of your CloudCannon experience.
* Configuration Mode — Learn how to edit your *Site* configuration from any page and see it update in real time.
* Collections — Learn
* Cards — Learn
* Commit Messages — Learn
* Backups — Learn
* Flags — Learn

Let's briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## CloudCannon Configuration Files

The <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/c/configuration-files.yml">CloudCannon Configuration File</comp.GlossaryTerm> allow you to define preferences and settings for your *Site* to customize its functionality and appearance. CloudCannon supports `.yml` (recommended), `.yaml`, and `.json` *Configuration Files,* and you can have one or several files depending on your desired workflow and permissions.

For a more in-depth explanation of the *CloudCannon Configuration File*, please read our documentation:

* [What is the CloudCannon Configuration File?](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-the-cloudcannon-configuration-file/)
* [Create your CloudCannon configuration file](/documentation/developer-articles/create-your-cloudcannon-configuration-file/)
* [Define a custom Configuration File path](/documentation/developer-articles/define-a-custom-configuration-file-path/)
* [Why split your Configuration File?](/documentation/developer-articles/why-split-your-configuration-file/)
* [Defining the same key in multiple Configuration Files](/documentation/developer-articles/defining-the-same-key-in-multiple-configuration-files/)
* [Best practice for splitting your Configuration File](/documentation/developer-articles/best-practice-for-splitting-your-configuration-file/)
* [Split your Configuration File](/documentation/developer-articles/split-your-configuration-file/)

## Configuration Mode

The <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/c/configuration-mode.yml">Configuration Mode</comp.GlossaryTerm> switch in the top right of your *Site Header* or *Editing Interface Header* toggles the visibility of *Configuration Buttons* in the app. You can use these to modify the configuration of specific elements and see your changes update the <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/u/ui.yml">UI</comp.GlossaryTerm> in real time.

For a more in-depth explanation of *Configuration Mode*, please read our documentation:

* [What is Configuration Mode?](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-configuration-mode/)
* [Using the configuration cascade](/documentation/developer-articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/)

## Collections

&nbsp;

<comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/c/collection.yml">Collections</comp.GlossaryTerm> are groups of related files with a repeated format. They form the foundation of how content is organized in CloudCannon. You might have a collection for blog posts, team members, or product pages.

For a more in-depth explanation of Collections, please read our documentation:

* [Configure your collections](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-your-collections/)
* [Set a default editing interface](/documentation/developer-articles/set-a-default-editing-interface/)

## Cards

<comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/c/card.yml">Cards</comp.GlossaryTerm> are the visual previews of collection items in the CloudCannon interface. You can configure how cards display information, including which fields appear and how they are formatted.

For a more in-depth explanation of card configuration, please read our documentation:

* [Configure your card previews](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-your-card-previews/)

## Commit Messages

<comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/c/card.yml">Cards</comp.GlossaryTerm> are the visual previews of collection items in the CloudCannon interface. You can configure how cards display information, including which fields appear and how they are formatted.

For a more in-depth explanation of card configuration, please read our documentation:

* [Configure your card previews](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-your-card-previews/)

## Backups

<comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/f/flags.yml">Flags</comp.GlossaryTerm> are configuration options that control specific behaviors in CloudCannon. They allow you to fine-tune how your Site works, from <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/i/input.yml">input</comp.GlossaryTerm> behavior to editing interface options.

For a more in-depth explanation of Flags, please read our documentation:

* [What are Flags?](/documentation/developer-articles/what-are-flags/)

## Flags

<comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/f/flags.yml">Flags</comp.GlossaryTerm> are configuration options that control specific behaviors in CloudCannon.
