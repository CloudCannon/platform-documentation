<comp.Notice info_type="permissions">
  <p><strong>Permissions required</strong></p><p>Members of the Owners or Developers <a href="/documentation/user-articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/">Default Permission Groups</a>, or <a href="/documentation/developer-articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/">Custom Permission Groups</a> with the <code>org:settings:git:provider:write</code> permission, can manage GitHub App installations.</p>
</comp.Notice>

A GitHub App installation grants CloudCannon access to repositories on a specific GitHub account or organization. You can manage which installations are connected to your *Organization* through *Org Settings*.

When scoped installations are enabled, each *Site* you create selects an installation first, which determines which repositories are available in the *Repository* dropdown.

## View your installations

To view the GitHub App installations connected to your *Organization*:

1. Click the *Org Settings* button in the *App Sidebar*.
2. Navigate to *GitHub* under the *Files* heading.

Below your authentication status, the *Installations* section shows your connected installations as clickable cards. Click a card to view its details, including the installation ID and account type.

If no installations are connected, CloudCannon will show a message and an *Add Installation* button.

## Add an installation

You can add a GitHub App installation in two places: from *Org Settings* or during *Site* creation.

### From Org Settings

1. Navigate to *Org Settings* &gt; *Files* &gt; *GitHub*.
2. Click *Add Installation*.
3. If available installations are detected from your GitHub account, select one and click *Add*. Otherwise, click *Install GitHub App* to install the app on a new GitHub account.

### During Site creation

If you are an Owner of the *Organization*, you can also add an installation directly from the *Create a Site* page:

1. Select *GitHub repository* from the *File source* dropdown.
2. If no installations are available, click *Install GitHub App* to install the CloudCannon GitHub App on a new GitHub account or organization.
3. The new installation will appear in the *Installation* dropdown once connected.

### Install the GitHub App for the first time

If no GitHub App installations are available at all, you need to install the CloudCannon GitHub App on your GitHub account:

1. Click *Install GitHub App* from either the *GitHub* page in *Org Settings* or the *Site* creation page.
2. GitHub will prompt you to select which account or organization to install the app on.
3. Choose whether to grant access to all repositories or only select repositories.
4. After installation, return to CloudCannon and bind the new installation to your *Organization*.

## Remove an installation

To disconnect a GitHub App installation from your *Organization*:

1. Navigate to *Org Settings* &gt; *Files* &gt; *GitHub*.
2. Click the installation card you want to remove.
3. On the installation detail page, click *Remove Installation* and confirm.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Removing an installation does not uninstall the GitHub App from your GitHub account. It only disconnects the installation from your CloudCannon *Organization*. Existing *Sites* that use repositories from that installation will continue to work, but you will not be able to create new *Sites* with repositories from that installation until it is re-added.
</comp.Notice>

## Installation permissions

Not all members of your CloudCannon *Organization* can add installations. CloudCannon enforces the following rules:

* **Organization installations** — Only users who are admins of the corresponding GitHub organization can connect the installation to CloudCannon. Regular GitHub organization members cannot add installations, even if they can see repositories from them.
* **Personal installations** — Only the owner of the GitHub account can connect their personal installation.

This restriction exists because the GitHub API returns all installations a user can access (read repositories from), but does not distinguish between read access and administrative access. CloudCannon checks your GitHub organization role at bind time to prevent unauthorized connections.

If you do not see an installation you expect in the *Available installations* list, verify that you have admin access to the corresponding GitHub account or organization.
