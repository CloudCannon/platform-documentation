<comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/a/assets.yml">Assets</comp.GlossaryTerm> are often the most visually important part of your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site.yml">Site</comp.GlossaryTerm>. They are also usually the largest. Storing assets in a <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/g/git-repository.yml">Git repository</comp.GlossaryTerm> can quickly become an issue. Git repositories usually max out around 2GB of storage. The size and number of files can also contribute to a slower build. It is a good idea to investigate an alternative storage for assets. To help, CloudCannon can seamlessly connect to your external asset storage. This allows your editors to upload and choose images from any editing interface.

External asset storage is often referred to as a <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/d/dam.yml">DAM</comp.GlossaryTerm> (Digital Asset Manager) and they can do a lot more than just store the files. DAMs can attach extra metadata to your assets, add complex sorting and even do handy image transformations on the fly. Alternatively, they can just store your assets and serve them from a <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/c/cdn.yml">CDN</comp.GlossaryTerm> (Content Delivery Network).

Articles in this section are useful for developers responsible for configuring asset storage and managing large files in CloudCannon.

In the Assets section of our Developer documentation, we cover:

* DAMs — Learn how to connect external storage like S3, Cloudinary, Azure, and more
* Managing your connected DAMs — Learn how to configure and manage your DAM connections
* Upload paths — Learn how to control where assets are uploaded and how they are named

Let's briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## DAMs

CloudCannon integrates with several DAMs to store your images and documents outside your Git repository. This keeps your repository lightweight and your builds fast. Your editors can upload and select assets from any editing interface, and the DAM serves them from a CDN.

CloudCannon integrates with: Azure Blob Storage, Cloudflare R2, Cloudinary, Digital Ocean, Google Cloud Storage, S3, and Tenovos. If you require a DAM we do not currently support, please [reach out to our support team](/documentation/support/).

For a more in-depth explanation of DAMs, including how to connect and configure them, please read our documentation:

* [Creating an Azure DAM](/documentation/developer-articles/creating-an-azure-dam/)
* [Creating a Cloudflare R2 DAM](/documentation/developer-articles/creating-a-cloudflare-r2-dam/)
* [Creating a Cloudinary DAM](/documentation/developer-articles/creating-a-cloudinary-dam/)
* [Creating a DigitalOcean Spaces DAM](/documentation/developer-articles/creating-a-digitalocean-spaces-dam/)
* [Creating a Google Cloud Storage DAM](/documentation/developer-articles/creating-a-google-cloud-storage-dam/)
* [Creating an S3 DAM](/documentation/developer-articles/creating-an-s3-dam/)
* [Creating a Tenovos DAM](/documentation/developer-articles/creating-a-tenovos-dam/)
* [Integrating your DAM with CloudCannon](/documentation/developer-articles/integrating-your-dam-with-cloudcannon/)
* [Managing your connected DAMs](/documentation/developer-articles/managing-your-connected-dams/)

## Managing uploads

Upload paths control where new assets are saved when your team uploads files. You can configure different paths for site uploads and DAM uploads. Paths support template strings with placeholders for dynamic naming based on the file or collection context.

For a more in-depth explanation of upload paths and asset management, please read our documentation:

* [Managing your connected DAMs](/documentation/developer-articles/managing-your-connected-dams/)
