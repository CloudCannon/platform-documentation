<comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/a/assets.yml">Assets</comp.GlossaryTerm> are often the most visually important part of your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site.yml">Site</comp.GlossaryTerm>, but they can also be the largest. Storing large assets in your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/g/git-repository.yml">Git repository</comp.GlossaryTerm> can become an issue, as most *Git Repositories* have a maximum storage amount, and larger *Repositories* have slower <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/b/build.yml">Build</comp.GlossaryTerm> times.

You can configure a <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/d/dam.yml">Digital Asset Manager</comp.GlossaryTerm> to store your assets externally and connect it to your CloudCannon *Site*. *DAMs* also allow you to attach extra metadata to your assets, add complex sorting, and perform image transformations.

Articles in this section are useful for developers responsible for configuring asset storage and managing large files in CloudCannon.

In the Assets section of our Developer documentation, we cover:

* DAMs — Learn how to connect external storage like S3, Cloudinary, Azure, and more
* Configuring paths — Learn how to configure where assets are uploaded and how they are served

Let's briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## DAMs

CloudCannon integrates with several DAM providers to store your images and documents outside your Git repository. Your editors can upload and select assets from any editing interface, and the DAM serves them from a CDN.

For a more in-depth explanation of DAMs, including how to connect and configure them, please read our documentation:

* [Creating an Azure DAM](/documentation/developer-articles/creating-an-azure-dam/)
* [Creating a Cloudflare R2 DAM](/documentation/developer-articles/creating-a-cloudflare-r2-dam/)
* [Creating a Cloudinary DAM](/documentation/developer-articles/creating-a-cloudinary-dam/)
* [Creating a DigitalOcean Spaces DAM](/documentation/developer-articles/creating-a-digitalocean-spaces-dam/)
* [Creating a Google Cloud Storage DAM](/documentation/developer-articles/creating-a-google-cloud-storage-dam/)
* [Creating an S3 DAM](/documentation/developer-articles/creating-an-s3-dam/)
* [Creating a Tenovos DAM](/documentation/developer-articles/creating-a-tenovos-dam/)
* [Managing your connected DAMs](/documentation/developer-articles/managing-your-connected-dams/)
* [Integrating your DAM with CloudCannon](/documentation/developer-articles/integrating-your-dam-with-cloudcannon/)

## Configuring paths

For finer control of your assets, you can configure where CloudCannon will save new assets after a team member uploads one, and update the DAM asset URLs to use relative paths.

For a more in-depth explanation of upload paths and asset management, please read our documentation:

* [Adjusting the uploads path](/documentation/developer-articles/adjusting-the-uploads-path/)
* [DAM assets with relative paths](/documentation/developer-articles/dam-assets-with-relative-paths/)
