<comp.Notice info_type="permissions">
  <p><strong>Permissions required</strong></p><p>Members of the Owners <a href="/documentation/user-articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/">Default Permission Group</a> can migrate an Organization to scoped GitHub installations.</p>
</comp.Notice>

If your *Organization* was created before scoped GitHub installations were available, you can migrate to take advantage of fine-grained repository access control. The migration is additive — it enables the new workflow without disrupting your existing *Sites*.

## What changes with scoped installations

With scoped installations enabled:

* When creating a new *Site*, you select a GitHub App installation before choosing a repository. The *Installation* dropdown determines which repositories appear in the *Repository* dropdown.
* Each installation corresponds to a specific GitHub account or organization, giving you precise control over which repositories are available.
* You can manage installations from the *GitHub* page in *Org Settings* &gt; *Files*, where installations appear as clickable cards.

Existing *Sites* continue to sync normally. The migration only affects how new *Sites* select repositories.

## How to migrate

1. Click the *Org Settings* button in the *App Sidebar*.
2. Navigate to *GitHub* under the *Files* heading.

Below the authentication section, a migration card will display the migration status for your *Organization*, including:

* **Detected installations** — GitHub App installations found on your authenticated GitHub account.
* **Unresolved Sites** — existing *Sites* whose repositories are not yet covered by a bound installation.
* **Needs binding** — whether any detected installations need to be connected to your *Organization*.

### Step 1: Bind installations

If there are detected installations that are not yet bound:

1. Review the list of available installations.
2. Click *Bind installations* to connect them to your *Organization*.

This ensures your existing *Sites* will continue to have access to their repositories under the new scoped workflow.

### Step 2: Review coverage

After binding, review the migration status to confirm all your existing *Sites* are covered. If any *Sites* are listed as unresolved, you may need to install the CloudCannon GitHub App on additional GitHub accounts or grant access to additional repositories.

### Step 3: Enable scoped installations

Once all installations are bound and *Sites* are covered:

1. Click *Enable scoped installations*.
2. CloudCannon will enable the scoped workflow for your *Organization*.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Enabling scoped installations is a one-way action. Once enabled, all new GitHub *Sites* will use the installation-scoped workflow. You can still add and remove installations at any time from the *GitHub* page in *Org Settings*.
</comp.Notice>

## Troubleshooting

### Some Sites are listed as unresolved

This means the repositories used by those *Sites* are not accessible through any of the bound installations. To resolve this:

* Install the CloudCannon GitHub App on the GitHub account or organization that owns those repositories.
* Ensure the app has access to the relevant repositories (you can configure this in your GitHub settings).
* Bind the new installation to your *Organization*.

### I don't see any installations to bind

Make sure you have authenticated your GitHub account in *Org Settings* &gt; *Files* &gt; *GitHub*. CloudCannon can only detect installations for authenticated GitHub accounts.

If you have authenticated but still see no installations, you may need to [install the GitHub App](/documentation/developer-articles/manage-your-github-app-installations/) on your GitHub account first.
