Connecting to your self-hosted GitLab allows you to work on your websites locally and have the changes sync to CloudCannon. File changes made on CloudCannon also get synced back to your self-hosted GitLab repository.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  To connect to a *GitLab.com* repository instead, follow the instructions listed for [GitLab](/documentation/developer-articles/connecting-a-gitlab-respository-as-your-source/).
</comp.Notice>

## Connecting to an instance

Before syncing with a repository in your self-hosted GitLab, you need to connect CloudCannon to your self-hosted instance. You only need to do this once per account.

To connect to your self-hosted GitLab instance:

1. Navigate to *Org Settings* &gt; *Files* &gt; *Self-hosted GitLab*.
2. Enter the details for your self-hosted instance of GitLab.
3. Click *Configure Self Hosted GitLab*.

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/gitlab-self-hosted-settings.png" alt="Self hosted GitLab entry interface" title="" type="screenshot"/>

The details for this page come from the GitLab server under *User Settings / Applications*.

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/files-source-syncing-gitlab-settings.png" alt="Settings page from Gitlab" title="" type="screenshot"/>

The Redirect URI is [https://app.cloudcannon.com/self\_hosted\_gitlab/authorize/](https://app.cloudcannon.com/self_hosted_gitlab/authorize/) The minimal scopes required are:

1. api
2. read\_user
3. read\_repository
4. write\_repository
5. openid

Once completed, the key and secret will be available for use in CloudCannon. The URLs should match the form placeholders.

## Authenticate

After configuring your server, you will see the *Authentication* tab. You can connect to GitLab via one of two methods.

### Connecting with your user account

You can connect to GitLab by authenticating with your user account. This will give your CloudCannon *Organization* access to the same GitLab repositories you have access to.

Click the *Authenticate* button. This redirects you to your self-hosted GitLab instance. Log in and authorize CloudCannon access to your self-hosted GitLab account, after which you will be redirected back to CloudCannon.

### Authenticating with a group access token

Alternatively, you can create a group access token in GitLab and save that token in CloudCannon. This will give your CloudCannon *Organization* access to all the resources scoped to your token. See GitLab's [Group access tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/settings/group_access_tokens.html) documentation for how to create and configure a token.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  For full functionality on CloudCannon, your group access token should have (at least) the Maintainer role, and the `api`, `read_api`, `read_repository`, and `write_repository` scopes.
</comp.Notice>

Copy the token into the *Group Access Token* field. You will also need to provide the expiry date of the token. CloudCannon will send a warning email to all owners of your *Organization* when the token is about to expire.

Click *Save and authenticate* to finish.

## Syncing with a repository

To connect a self-hosted GitLab repository and start syncing files:

1. Click the *Sites* button in the *App Sidebar* to open the *Sites Browser*.
2. Click *Create a Site*.
3. Select *Self-hosted GitLab repository* from the *File source* dropdown.
4. Select a repository and branch. If you don't have an appropriate branch ready, create a new one in GitLab and refresh this page.
5. Enter a name for your *Site* and click *Create Site and start syncing*.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Any existing files on your website will be replaced with the contents of the selected repository. Click *Create Site and start syncing* to continue, or exit the page to cancel the process.
</comp.Notice>

Your self-hosted GitLab is now connected. Changes you push to the Git repository are pulled in by CloudCannon. Any changes made on CloudCannon are automatically committed and pushed.

## Configuring your GitLab connection

Once you've connected your GitLab server, you can configure CloudCannon to support your particular infrastructure. You can find these configuration options under the *Server* tab at *Org Settings* &gt; *Files* &gt; *Self-hosted GitLab* &gt; *Server*. The options you have for configuring CloudCannon are:

* Minimum Access Level,
* Custom Headers, and
* Custom CA Certificate.

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/self-hosted-gitlab-settings.png" alt="Self Hosted GitLab settings interface" title="" type="screenshot"/>

The **Minimum Access Level** setting allows you to change the minimum access CloudCannon requires to a GitLab repo to connect to it. By default CloudCannon requires Maintainer access to a repo before syncing to it. Self Hosted GitLab allows custom access level permissions so a lower access level may be sufficient, depending on your setup.

The **Custom Headers** setting allows you to configure additional headers for CloudCannon to use when connecting to your GitLab server. Custom headers are passed using Git's `http.extraHeader` configuration option and in the form `key:value`.

The **Custom CA Certificate** allows you to upload a PEM encoded certificate or certificate chain for CloudCannon to trust during Git operations. The certificate is passed using Git's `http.sslCAInfo` configuration option.

## Unauthenticate

If you need to revoke CloudCannon's access to your self-hosted GitLab account:

1. Navigate to *Org Settings* &gt; *Files* &gt; *Self-hosted GitLab* &gt; *Authentication* tab.
2. Click the *Unauthenticate* button.

Unauthenticating severs the token link but preserves the server configuration. Existing *Sites* retain their files and configuration, but future syncs will fail with a provider error until you re-authenticate.

## Disconnect server

If you need to completely remove the self-hosted GitLab configuration from your *Organization*:

1. Navigate to *Org Settings* &gt; *Files* &gt; *Self-hosted GitLab* &gt; *Danger Zone* tab.
2. You must unauthenticate first before the disconnect button becomes available.
3. Click *Disconnect Self Hosted GitLab*.

Disconnecting destroys the server configuration entirely. You will need to re-enter all instance details to reconnect. Sites currently syncing through this server will fail on their next sync with a provider error until a new connection is established.
