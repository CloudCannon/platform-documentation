Command line options instruct CloudCannon how to run your SSG and your Site.

You can configure the following options:

* **Install Command** — the command to install any dependencies required for your Site.
* **Build Command** — the command to build your Site.
* **Output Path** — the location your Site will build to.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If you have yet to [configure your first Site build](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-your-first-build/), CloudCannon will suggest command line options based on your SSG and the contents of your Site files.
</comp.Notice>

To configure your command line options:

1. Navigate to the *Build configuration* page under *Site Settings*.
2. Under *Command line options*, enter your *Install Command*, *Build Command*, and *Output Path*.
3. Click the *Update Site* button.

Command line options are often used in conjunction with environment variables. For more information, please read our documentation on [configuring your environment variables](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-your-environment-variables/).
