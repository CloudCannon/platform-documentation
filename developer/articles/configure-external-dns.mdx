<comp.Notice info_type="permissions">
  **Permissions required**

  Members of the Owners or Developers [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/), or [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/) with the `base-domain:settings:dns` permission, can edit DNS details on a Custom Domain's dedicated Domain page.
</comp.Notice>

If you are hosting your website through CloudCannon and selected external DNS as your DNS provider, CloudCannon will ask you to update the DNS records on your DNS provider. Specifically, you need to add a CNAME record to direct queries for any subdomains to CloudCannon's hosting servers, and two A records to specify the IP addresses of the appropriate CloudCannon hosting servers for the your Custom Domain.

For more information on DNS records, please read our documentation on [DNS](/documentation/articles/what-is-dns/#what-is-a-nameserver).

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  If you are using Cloudflare as your DNS provider, you will need to configure your DNS records differently. For more information, please read the section on [configuring Cloudflare proxy](/documentation/articles/configure-external-dns/#configure-cloudflare-proxy).
</comp.Notice>

These instructions assume you have [connected a Custom Domain to your Organization](/documentation/articles/connect-a-custom-domain-to-your-organization/) and selected external DNS.

To configure DNS records for an external provider:

1. Log in to CloudCannon and select the Organization with the Custom Domain you want to update.
2. Click the *Domains* button in the *App Sidebar*. CloudCannon will open the *Domains browser*.
3. Identify the domain you want to configure and click on the *Domain* card. CloudCannon will open the *Domain* page for this Custom Domain.
4. On the *DNS* tab, CloudCannon will list the CNAME record and A records for your Custom Domain.
5. Log in to your DNS Provider and follow their instructions to update your DNS records to match those provided by CloudCannon.

Your DNS Provider will process your updated DNS records. This should take a few minutes, but may take up to 24 hours.

## Configure Cloudflare Proxy

CloudCannon hosting uses Cloudflare. This means if you use Cloudflare as your DNS Provider and have Cloudflare's Proxy feature enabled for your DNS records, you will not be able to proxy directly to the normal CloudCannon CNAME (i.e., sites.cloudcannon.com) as it will result in a 1001 DNS Error.

To resolve this issue, you can either turn off Orange Cloud or set up Cloudflare Proxy with CloudCannon Origin and add a CNAME record to your DNS provider.

These instructions assume you have [connected a Custom Domain to your Organization](/documentation/articles/connect-a-custom-domain-to-your-organization/), selected external DNS, and use Cloudflare Proxy.

To configure DNS records for an external provider:

1. Log in to CloudCannon and select the Organization with the Custom Domain you want to update.
2. Click the *Domains* button in the *App Sidebar*. CloudCannon will open the *Domains browser*.
3. Identify the domain you want to configure and click on the *Domain* card. CloudCannon will open the *Domain* page for this Custom Domain.
4. On the *Network* tab, CloudCannon will list all your subdomains in the *Subdomains browser*. Identify the subdomain you want to configure and click on the *Subdomain* card (Note: this could be your base domain).
5. Under *Hosting Setup*, click the *Configure* button. CloudCannon will open the *Configure hosting setup* modal.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Your Site might be cached externally if you use Cloudflare Proxy. In this case, your Site won't show any updates until you manually clear your cache.

## Single Origin

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  We do not recommend this option unless you have specific set up requirements. For assistance setting up your DNS, please contact our friendly [support team](/support/).
</comp.Notice>

In some cases, you may need to configure your DNS records to point directly at CloudCannon's host origin rather than *sites.cloudcannon.com*. This bypasses the normal benefits of hosting on CloudCannon:

* The ability for CloudCannon to auto-generate a wildcard SSL certificate for your domain and its subdomains.
* Faster DNS lookup speed due to a globally distributed edge caching network.

Most commonly, you might use this setup if you need to point your base domain at CloudCannon while also using an external DNS.
