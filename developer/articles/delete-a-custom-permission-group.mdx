Alternatively, you can delete a Group from the *Team* page by clicking on the *Context Menu* in the top right of a Group card and selecting *Delete Group*.

CloudCannon will delete this Permission Group, and all members will lose any permissions associated with the Group.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Each team member in your Organization must be a member of at least one Permission Group. If you delete a team member's last Permission Group, this action will also remove them from your Organization.
