CloudCannon is a <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/g/git.yml">Git-backed</comp.GlossaryTerm> <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/c/cms.yml">CMS</comp.GlossaryTerm>, allowing you to store your website source files securely on a *Git Provider*. One benefit of *Git* is the capacity to work on content changes in parallel with separate *Branches* and control when changes are published to your live website. In CloudCannon, you can configure a <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/p/project.yml">Project</comp.GlossaryTerm> for managing *Sites* connected to *Branches* in a single *Git Repository*, including designating a "Main" *Branch* and defining publishing workflows.

Articles in this section are useful for developers responsible for configuring publishing workflows, commit messages, and branching in CloudCannon.

In the Publishing section of our Developer documentation, we cover:

* Projects — Learn how to group multiple *Sites* connected to a single *Git Repository* and enable upstream publishing
* Publishing Methods — Learn how to configure the method of publishing changes from one branch to another

Let's briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## Projects

In CloudCannon, a <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/p/project.yml">Project</comp.GlossaryTerm> is a group of *Sites* connected to *Branches* from a single *Git Repository*. Creating a *Project* allows you to designate a "Main" *Branch* in your *Repository* and define branching rules.

For a more in-depth explanation of *Projects*, please read our documentation:

* [Create a Project](/documentation/developer-articles/create-a-project/)
* [Add related links to your project](/documentation/developer-articles/add-related-links-to-your-project/)

## Publishing Methods

You can refine your publishing workflows in CloudCannon, choosing which <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/p/publish-branch.yml">Publish Branch</comp.GlossaryTerm> each *Site* should publish to, selecting whether publishing is automatic or requires a <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/p/pull-request.yml">Pull Request</comp.GlossaryTerm>, and defining templates for *Pull Requests* for documenting your website changes.

For a more in-depth explanation of publishing methods, please read our documentation:

* [Connect a Publish Branch](/documentation/developer-articles/connect-a-publish-branch/)
* [Disable branch publishing](/documentation/developer-articles/disable-branch-publishing/)
* [Merging and pull requests](/documentation/developer-articles/merging-and-pull-requests/)
