Publishing in CloudCannon is how changes from your editing environment flow back to your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/g/git-repository.yml">Git repository</comp.GlossaryTerm>. When your team saves content in CloudCannon, those changes are <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/c/commit.yml">committed</comp.GlossaryTerm> and pushed to your connected branch. Publishing encompasses commit messages, projects, and the workflows that move changes from branch <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site.yml">Sites</comp.GlossaryTerm> to your main Site.

Articles in this section are useful for developers responsible for configuring publishing workflows, commit messages, and branching in CloudCannon.

CloudCannon supports different publishing workflows to match how your team uses Git. You can configure direct publishing to the main branch, or set up a staging workflow where changes are reviewed before going live. Commit messages can be customized to include useful context for your Git history.

In the Publishing section of our Developer documentation, we cover:

* Commit Messages — Learn how to configure how commit messages are generated when your team saves
* Upstream commit message templates — Learn how to customize commit messages for Client Sharing
* Projects — Learn how to organize Sites that share a repository and configure branching
* Connect a Publish Branch — Learn how to set up staging workflows with branch Sites
* Pull request templates — Learn how to add templates to <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/p/pull-request.yml">pull requests</comp.GlossaryTerm> created by CloudCannon
* Merging and pull requests — Learn how CloudCannon integrates with Git provider workflows
* Disable branch publishing — Learn how to control which branches can publish changes

Let's briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## Commit Messages

Commit messages record what changed when your team saves content. CloudCannon can generate commit messages automatically, or you can configure custom templates that include the file path, user, and other context.

For a more in-depth explanation of commit message configuration, please read our documentation:

* [Configure your commit messages](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-your-commit-messages/)
* [Configure an upstream commit message template](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-an-upstream-commit-message-template/)
* [Configure the commit details for clients](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-the-commit-details-for-clients/)

## Projects

Projects group Sites that share the same Git repository. They provide a high-level view of your Sites and allow you to configure branching settings. Creating a Project enables your team to create new branch Sites from a template.

For a more in-depth explanation of Projects, please read our documentation:

* [Create a Project](/documentation/developer-articles/create-a-project/)
* [Add related links to your project](/documentation/developer-articles/add-related-links-to-your-project/)

## Publishing Methods

CloudCannon supports different publishing methods depending on your workflow. You can publish directly to your main branch, or use a <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/p/publish-branch.yml">Publish Branch</comp.GlossaryTerm> workflow where changes are merged or go through pull requests before reaching your live Site.

For a more in-depth explanation of publishing methods, please read our documentation:

* [What is a Publish Branch?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-publish-branch/)
* [Connect a Publish Branch](/documentation/developer-articles/connect-a-publish-branch/)
* [Update from a Publish Branch](/documentation/user-articles/update-from-a-publish-branch/)
* [Disable branch publishing](/documentation/developer-articles/disable-branch-publishing/)
* [What is a pull request template?](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-a-pull-request-template/)
* [Configure a pull request template](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-a-pull-request-template/)
* [Merging and pull requests](/documentation/developer-articles/merging-and-pull-requests/)

## Publishing, Merging and Pull requests

Most repositories have a main branch which stores the main version of the code. Some repositories have other branches which separate changes from the main branch. Bringing these changes into the main can be done in two ways:

1. [Merging](/documentation/developer-articles/merging-and-pull-requests/): A direct <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/m/merge.yml">merge</comp.GlossaryTerm> with no review process.
2. [Pull requests](/documentation/developer-articles/merging-and-pull-requests/): An audit flow built into Git providers that requires reviewers and automated testing to pass.

On CloudCannon this feature is called Publishing. This can be configured to match how your team uses Git.

For a more in-depth explanation of publishing, including how merging and pull requests work, please read our documentation:

* [Merging and pull requests](/documentation/developer-articles/merging-and-pull-requests/)
* [What are publishing conflicts?](/documentation/user-articles/what-are-publishing-conflicts/)
* [Resolve publishing conflicts](/documentation/user-articles/resolve-publishing-conflicts/)
