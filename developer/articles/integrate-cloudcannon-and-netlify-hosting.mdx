[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is a platform to deploy your website or web app that integrates well with CloudCannon. You can use Netlify to host your static site and CloudCannon to edit and manage your content. This is particularly useful if you want to use Netlify hosting, but need a user friendly interface for non-technical content creators.

You can integrate CloudCannon and Netlify by [configuring a build deploy](/documentation/articles/configure-build-deploys/) from your CloudCannon Site to an output repository, then connecting Netlify to the output repository. Every time someone updates your Site content, CloudCannon deploys the build files to your output repository for Netlify to host.

If you want, you can follow Netlify's [Getting Started](https://docs.netlify.com/get-started/) documentation.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  These instructions assume you already have CloudCannon Site and have configured build deploys. For more information please read our [starter guides](/documentation/guides/) and [build deploy](/documentation/articles/configure-build-deploys/) documentation.
</comp.Notice>

To integrate your output repository with Netlify:

1. Log in or sign up to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/login).
2. On the Netlify Dashboard, click the *Import from Git* button to add a new Git repository. If you already have a Netlify Site, click the *Add new site* button in the top right of the Dashboard.
3. On the *Connect to a Git provider* page, select your Git provider. Netlify and CloudCannon both support GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. If you have not already, you must authenticate your Git provider through Netlify.
4. On the *Select repository* page, select the output repository for your CloudCannon Site.
5. On the *Configure site and deploy* page, enter the details for your build settings, in particular the *Branch to deploy,* *Build command*, and *Publish directory*. You build command and publish directory will depend on your SSG.
6. Click the *Deploy* button.

Now, whenever you update your content in CloudCannon, the changes will deploy to your output repository and Netlify will update your live Site.
