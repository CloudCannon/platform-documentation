You can prevent a Site from building each time you [save your changes](/documentation/user-articles/save-your-changes/) by turning on *Building Locked* in the *Site Settings*. Locking builds on your Site is useful if you want to manage deployment manually.

CloudCannon uses your most recent, successful build to generate previews for the [Visual Editor](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-visual-editor/), the [Test Domain](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-testing-domain/), and screenshots in your [Collection](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-collection/) browser. When you lock builds on your Site, previews from the most recent successful build will remain live but will be out-of-date with any subsequent changes.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  CloudCannon automatically locks builds if you have not [configured your first build](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-your-first-build/) or selected [Headless Mode](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-headless-mode/) on your Site.
</comp.Notice>

To lock builds for your Site:

1. Navigate to the *Build configuration* page under *Site Settings*.
2. Check the *Building Locked* checkbox.
3. Click the *Update Site* button.

You can enable builds again by unchecking the *Building Locked* checkbox at any time.
