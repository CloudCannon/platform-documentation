Connecting GitHub allows you to work on your websites locally and have the changes sync to CloudCannon. File changes made on CloudCannon are also synced back to GitHub.

CloudCannon uses the CloudCannon GitHub App to access your repositories. Your *Organization* connects to one or more GitHub App installations, and each installation grants access to repositories on a specific GitHub account or organization.

## Authenticate GitHub

Before connecting a repository, you must authenticate your GitHub account with CloudCannon:

1. Navigate to *Org Settings* &gt; *Files* &gt; *GitHub* &gt; *Authentication* tab.
2. Click the *Authenticate* button.
3. Follow the GitHub prompts to authorize CloudCannon.

You only need to authenticate once per *Organization*.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If you previously authenticated with an older version of the CloudCannon GitHub integration, you may be prompted to re-authenticate when you next interact with GitHub settings. This ensures your credentials work with the latest GitHub App.
</comp.Notice>

## Connect a GitHub App installation

After authenticating, you need at least one GitHub App installation connected to your *Organization*. Installations determine which repositories CloudCannon can access.

1. Navigate to *Org Settings* &gt; *Files* &gt; *GitHub* &gt; *Authentication* tab.
2. Click *Add Installation*.
3. If available installations are detected, select one and click *Add*. Otherwise, click *Install GitHub App* to install the CloudCannon GitHub App on your GitHub account or organization.

You can choose to grant access to all repositories or only select repositories during installation.

For more details, see [Manage your GitHub App installations](/documentation/developer-articles/manage-your-github-app-installations/).

<comp.Notice info_type="permissions">
  <p><strong>Permissions required</strong></p><p>Members of the Owners or Developers <a href="/documentation/user-articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/">Default Permission Groups</a>, or <a href="/documentation/developer-articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/">Custom Permission Groups</a> with the <code>org:settings:git:provider:write</code> permission, can manage GitHub App installations.</p>
</comp.Notice>

## Create a Site from a GitHub repository

Once you have authenticated and connected at least one installation:

1. Click the *Sites* button in the *App Sidebar* to open the *Sites Browser*.
2. Click *Create a Site*.
3. Select *GitHub repository* from the *File source* dropdown.
4. Use the *Installation* dropdown to choose which GitHub account's repositories you want to browse.
5. Use the *Repository* dropdown to select a repository from the chosen installation.
6. Choose a branch using the *Branch setup* section.
7. Enter a name for your *Site* and click *Create Site and start syncing*.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Any existing files on your website will be replaced with the contents of the selected repository. Click *Create Site and start syncing* to continue, or exit the page to cancel the process.
</comp.Notice>

GitHub is now connected. Changes you push to the Git repository are pulled in by CloudCannon. Any changes made on CloudCannon are automatically committed and pushed.

## View connected Sites

The *Sites* tab shows all *Sites* in your *Organization* that use GitHub as their file source. Navigate to *Org Settings* &gt; *Files* &gt; *GitHub* &gt; *Sites* tab to view them.

## Unauthenticate GitHub

If you need to revoke CloudCannon's access to your GitHub account:

1. Navigate to *Org Settings* &gt; *Files* &gt; *GitHub* &gt; *Authentication* tab.
2. Click the *Unauthenticate* button.

Unauthenticating removes CloudCannon's access token for GitHub. Existing *Sites* retain their files and configuration, but future syncs will fail with a provider error until you re-authenticate. Your *Site* repository and branch settings are preserved, so re-authenticating restores syncing without needing to reconfigure each *Site*.

## Migrating to scoped GitHub installations

If your *Organization* was set up before scoped installations were available, you can migrate to take advantage of fine-grained repository access control.

1. Navigate to *Org Settings* &gt; *Files* &gt; *GitHub* &gt; *Upgrade* tab.
2. A migration card will appear with steps to enable scoped installations.
3. Bind any available installations to your *Organization*.
4. Review the coverage report to ensure all your existing *Sites* are covered by the bound installations.
5. Click *Enable scoped installations* to complete the migration.

Existing *Sites* continue working during and after migration. The migration is additive — it enables the new installation-scoped workflow without disrupting your current setup.

For more details, see [Migrate to scoped GitHub installations](/documentation/developer-articles/migrate-to-scoped-github-installations/).
