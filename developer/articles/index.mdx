Welcome to CloudCannon's Developer Documentation. These articles cover everything you need to know about customizing CloudCannon.

A Developer is anyone who customizes CloudCannon for use by their team members or clients by configuring the UI, settings, file management, hosting, and more. A Developer can also be a User, and even if you don't use CloudCannon, it is often helpful to understand the CMS experience from the User's perspective (see our [User Articles](/documentation/user-articles/)).

As a Developer, you can work in the CloudCannon web app ([https://app.cloudcannon.com/](https://app.cloudcannon.com/)) or your local development environment, whichever you prefer. For some settings, you will need to use CloudCannon's User Interface (UI). The articles in this section of our documentation are designed to explain how CloudCannon works and provide instructions for configuring your CMS experience.

If you need any more help with your CloudCannon website, please don't hesitate to contact our friendly [support team](/support/).
