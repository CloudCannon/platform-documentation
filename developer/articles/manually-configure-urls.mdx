By default, CloudCannon automatically detect the output URLs for your files and assigns them at [build](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-a-site-build/) time. This is useful as you do not need to manually assign output URLs to each of your files.

However, this behavior may not be right for your Site if it has a larger number of files or custom Site configuration. For these Sites, CloudCannon's URLs assigning behavior may slow down your build time. For these Sites, you can disable automatic output URLs in CloudCannon and manually configure your output URLs.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Before disabling CloudCannon's automatic URL detection, you must configure the `collections\_config.\[\*\].url` key for all output [Collections](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-collection/).
</comp.Notice>

To manually configure your URLs:

1. Navigate to the *editing* page under *Site Settings*.
2. Click on the *Edit your configuration file* button to open your CloudCannon configuration file.
3. Navigate to the *Collections* array under the *Collections and Paths* section.
4. Click on each output Collections in the *Collections* array and ensure you have configured the *URL* key for each Collection.
5. When you are happy with your manually configured URLs for each output Collection, navigate to the *Build Configuration* page under *Site Settings*.
6. Check the *Manually Configure URLs* flag under *Build system options*.
7. Click the *Update Configuration and Build* button.

CloudCannon will immediately build your Site using the manually configured URLs.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Build-Configuration-Manually-Configure-URLs" alt="A screenshot of the Build Configuration page shows the checkbox for Manually Configure URLs under the Build system options section." type="screenshot" />

If you would prefer to configure the output URLs for your Collections in the Source Editor or your local development environment, you can achieve the same configuration with the following code:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````

collections_config:
  blog:
    path: content/blog
    url___1___: /travel/[slug].html

``````````
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  With automatic URL detection disabled, CloudCannon will use the explicitly configured output URL `/travel/[slug].html` for files in this Collection.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>
