<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Since October 2025, this method of visual editing has been deprecated. CloudCannon cannot guarantee support for this feature. Please consider using [Editable Regions](/documentation/user-articles/what-are-editable-regions/) or Bookshop.
</comp.Notice>

You can edit markdown files in the Visual Editor using an in-place Rich Text editor embedded on your page.

To do so, add the `data-cms-edit="content"` attribute to the relevant element on your site. For example:

<comp.CodeBlock language="html" source="page.html">
```
<div data-cms-edit="content">
  {{ content }}
</div>
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

When encountering this attribute, CloudCannon will replace the children of the tagged element with the Content Editor, connected to the Markdown content of the opened file.
