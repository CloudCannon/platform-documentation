You can configure three links for the Client Dashboard to help Clients find the necessary resources for your Site.

* **Preview URL** — Links to the preview of your live Site (e.g., the custom domain or [.cloudvent.net testing domain](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-testing-domain/)).
* **Documentation URL** — Links to the location where Clients can find documentation for your Site.
* **Support URL** — Links to the location where Clients can find support (e.g., a mailto with your support email address).

These links will appear in the *Site Navigation* and on the *Site Dashboard.*

To configure the links on the Client Dashboard:

1. Navigate to the *Client Sharing* page under *Site settings*.
2. Click on the *Settings* tab.
3. Enter the preview link in the *Preview URL* field.
4. Enter the documentation link in the *Documentation URL* field.
5. Enter the support link in the *Support URL* field.
6. Click the *Update* button at the bottom of the page.

CloudCannon will update the links on the Client Dashboard. Clients must refresh their page to see the updated links.
