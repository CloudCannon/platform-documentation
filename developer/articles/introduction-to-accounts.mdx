Accounts in CloudCannon are organized around <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/o/organization.yml">Organizations</comp.GlossaryTerm>. An Organization is the top-level container for your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site.yml">Sites</comp.GlossaryTerm>, <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/t/team-member.yml">team members</comp.GlossaryTerm>, and <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/b/billing.yml">billing</comp.GlossaryTerm>. As a Developer, you may need to create Organizations for clients, transfer Sites between Organizations, or manage account-level security settings.

Organizations have their own billing, <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/c/custom-domain.yml">Custom Domains</comp.GlossaryTerm>, and team members. If you work with multiple clients or need to separate projects, creating separate Organizations can help keep everything organized. <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/m/multi-factor-authentication.yml">Multi-factor Authentication</comp.GlossaryTerm> adds an extra layer of security to protect your account.

In the Accounts section of our documentation, we cover:

* [Organizations](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-an-organization/) — learn what an Organization is and how it structures your CloudCannon account.
* [Creating a new Organization](/documentation/developer-articles/creating-a-new-organization/) — set up a new Organization for a project or client.
* [Transferring Sites between Organizations](/documentation/developer-articles/transferring-sites-between-organizations/) — move a Site from one Organization to another.
* [Create a Client Organization](/documentation/developer-articles/create-a-client-organization/) — create a separate Organization for client billing and access.
* [Multi-factor Authentication](/documentation/developer-articles/enable-multi-factor-authentication/) — add an extra layer of security to your account.
* [Enforce Multi-factor Authentication](/documentation/developer-articles/enforce-multi-factor-authentication/) — require MFA for all Organization members.

Let's briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## Organizations

Organizations are the top-level container for your CloudCannon account. Each Organization has its own Sites, team members, billing, and Custom Domains. You might have one Organization for your own projects and another for each client.

For a more in-depth explanation of Organizations, including how to create and manage them, please read our documentation:

* [What is an Organization?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-an-organization/)
* [Creating a new Organization](/documentation/developer-articles/creating-a-new-organization/)
* [Create a Client Organization](/documentation/developer-articles/create-a-client-organization/)
* [Transferring Sites between Organizations](/documentation/developer-articles/transferring-sites-between-organizations/)

## Multi-factor Authentication

Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) adds a second factor to your login process, typically a code from an authenticator app. This helps protect your account even if your password is compromised. Organization Owners can optionally require MFA for all team members.

For a more in-depth explanation of Multi-factor Authentication, please read our documentation:

* [Enable Multi-factor Authentication](/documentation/developer-articles/enable-multi-factor-authentication/)
* [Enforce Multi-factor Authentication](/documentation/developer-articles/enforce-multi-factor-authentication/)
