Accounts in CloudCannon are organized around <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/o/organization.yml">Organizations</comp.GlossaryTerm>. An Organization is the top-level container for your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site.yml">Sites</comp.GlossaryTerm>, <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/t/team-member.yml">team members</comp.GlossaryTerm>, and <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/b/billing.yml">billing</comp.GlossaryTerm>. As a Developer, you may need to create Organizations for clients, transfer Sites between Organizations, or manage account-level security settings.

Articles in this section are useful for developers responsible for setting up Organizations, managing client accounts, or configuring account-level security.

In the Accounts section of our Developer documentation, we cover:

* Organizations — Learn what an Organization is and how to create, manage, and transfer Sites between them
* Multi-factor Authentication — Learn how to add an extra layer of security to your account and require MFA for Organization members

Let's briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## Organizations

Organizations are the top-level container for your CloudCannon account. Each Organization has its own Sites, team members, billing, and Custom Domains. You might have one Organization for your own projects and another for each client.

For a more in-depth explanation of Organizations, including how to create and manage them, please read our documentation:
