Connecting GitLab allows you to work on your websites locally and have the changes sync to CloudCannon. File changes made on CloudCannon also get synced back to GitLab.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  To connect to a *self-hosted GitLab* repository instead, follow the instructions listed for [Self-Hosted GitLab](/documentation/developer-articles/connecting-a-self-hosted-gitlab-repository-as-your-source/).
</comp.Notice>

## Authenticate GitLab

Before connecting a repository, you must authenticate your GitLab account with CloudCannon. Navigate to *Org Settings* &gt; *Files* &gt; *GitLab* &gt; *Authentication* tab. You can connect using one of two methods.

### Connecting with your user account

You can connect to GitLab by authenticating with your user account. This will give your CloudCannon *Organization* access to the same GitLab repositories you have access to.

1. Click the *Authenticate with GitLab* button.
2. Follow the GitLab prompts to authorize CloudCannon.

You will be redirected back to CloudCannon once authorization is complete.

### Authenticating with a group access token

Alternatively, you can create a group access token in GitLab and save that token in CloudCannon. This will give your CloudCannon *Organization* access to all the resources scoped to your token.

See GitLab's [Group access tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/settings/group_access_tokens.html) documentation for how to create and configure a token.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  For full functionality on CloudCannon, your group access token should have (at least) the Maintainer role, and the `api`, `read_api`, `read_repository`, and `write_repository` scopes.
</comp.Notice>

Copy the token into the *Group Access Token* field. You will also need to provide the expiry date of the token. CloudCannon will send a warning email to all owners of your *Organization* when the token is about to expire.

Click *Save and authenticate* to finish.

You only need to authenticate once per *Organization*.

## Create a Site from a GitLab repository

Once you have authenticated:

1. Click the *Sites* button in the *App Sidebar* to open the *Sites Browser*.
2. Click *Create a Site*.
3. Select *GitLab repository* from the *File source* dropdown.
4. Use the *Repository* dropdown to select a repository. If you don't have one for this website, create a new one in GitLab and refresh this page.
5. Choose a branch using the *Branch setup* section.
6. Enter a name for your *Site* and click *Create Site and start syncing*.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Any existing files on your website will be replaced with the contents of the selected repository. Click *Create Site and start syncing* to continue, or exit the page to cancel the process.
</comp.Notice>

GitLab is now connected. Changes you push to the Git repository are pulled in by CloudCannon. Any changes made on CloudCannon are automatically committed and pushed.

## View connected Sites

The *Sites* tab shows all *Sites* in your *Organization* that use GitLab as their file source. Navigate to *Org Settings* &gt; *Files* &gt; *GitLab* &gt; *Sites* tab to view them.

## Unauthenticate GitLab

If you need to revoke CloudCannon's access to your GitLab account:

1. Navigate to *Org Settings* &gt; *Files* &gt; *GitLab* &gt; *Authentication* tab.
2. Click the *Unauthenticate* button.

Unauthenticating removes CloudCannon's access token for GitLab. Existing *Sites* retain their files and configuration, but future syncs will fail with a provider error until you re-authenticate. Your *Site* repository and branch settings are preserved, so re-authenticating restores syncing without needing to reconfigure each *Site*.
