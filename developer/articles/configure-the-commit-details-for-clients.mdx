By default, when a Client edits your Site, the commit details will contain the name “CloudCannon” and email address “support@cloudcannon.com”.

You can configure the commit details for Clients to create a more accurate history of changes made to your Site.

To configure the commit details for a Client:

1. Navigate to the *Client Sharing* page under *Site settings*.
2. Click on the *Author* tab.
3. Under the *Author* tab, enter the name and email address you want to appear in the commit history.
4. Click the *Update* button.
