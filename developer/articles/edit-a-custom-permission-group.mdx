## Add a permission or exception to a Custom Permission Group

To add a permission to an existing [Custom Permission Group](/documentation/developer-articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/):

1. Navigate to the *Team* page under *Org settings*.
2. Click on the *Groups* tab.
3. Under the *Groups* tab, click on the Permission Group you want to delete. This will open the *Permission Group* page.
4. Click on the *Settings* tab.
5. Click on the *Add permission* or *Add exception* button to open the appropriate modal.
6. Select the scope using the *Scope* dropdown. If you select Base Domain, Group, Project, or Site, you must also choose the Target to that scope with the *Target* dropdown. Selecting a scope will automatically filter the resource tree.
7. Using the resource tree, select the resources you want to add and what actions you want to allow for each resource (i.e., Read, Write, or Create).
8. Click the *Add* button.
9. Once you are happy with the changes to your Permission Group, click the *Update group* button.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Custom-Permission-Group-Settings" alt="A screenshot of the Marketing Team Permission Group page shows permissions and the Add Permission button." type="screenshot" />

CloudCannon will add the new permission to your Custom Permission Group. All members of that group will automatically gain the new permission.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Alternatively, you can add a new permission or exception by cloning an existing one. This method is more efficient when you need to create many similar permissions (e.g., several permissions with a Site scope targeting different Sites).

  To clone a permission or exception, click on the *Context Menu* and select *Clone*. You can now edit the cloned item.
