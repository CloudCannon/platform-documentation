Sharing your CloudCannon *Sites* allows you to provide everyone on your team with access to your content. You can configure which resources they have access to, what actions they can perform, and how they log in to CloudCannon.

Articles in this section are helpful for developers responsible for configuring access to CloudCannon.

In the Sharing section of our Developer documentation, we cover:

* Custom Permission Groups — Learn how to create your own *Permission Groups* and specify which resources Group members can access
* Site Sharing — Learn how to give a team member permission to access a specific *Site* in your Organization
* Client Sharing — Learn how to create a site-specific password to share your content with people outside of CloudCannon
* SSO/SAML — Learn how to set up Single Sign-On for greater security
* Multi-factor Authentication — Learn how to add an extra layer of security to your account and require MFA for Organization members

Let’s briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## Custom Permission Groups

<comp.Notice info_type="pricing">
  **This feature is available on our** [**Team and Enterprise plans**](/pricing/)**.**
</comp.Notice>

CloudCannon provides Default Permission Groups for every <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/o/organization.yml">Organization</comp.GlossaryTerm>, but for more fine-grained permission control, you can use *Custom Permission Groups*. <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/c/custom-permission-group.yml">Custom Permission Groups</comp.GlossaryTerm> allow you to define exactly what resources its members can access and what actions they can perform.

For a more in-depth explanation of *Custom Permission Groups*, please read our documentation:

* [What are Custom Permission Groups?](/documentation/developer-articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/)
* [Create a Custom Permission Group](/documentation/developer-articles/create-a-custom-permission-group/)
* [Delete a Custom Permission Group](/documentation/developer-articles/delete-a-custom-permission-group/)
* [Edit a Custom Permission Group](/documentation/developer-articles/edit-a-custom-permission-group/)
* [Best practices for Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/developer-articles/best-practices-for-custom-permission-groups/)

## Site Sharing

You can share a specific *Site* with collaborators from outside your CloudCannon *Organization* without giving them access to all your *Sites*. There are two *Default Permission Groups* for *Site Sharing*, equivalent to the *Technical Editors* and *Editors* groups.

For a more in-depth explanation of *Site Sharing*, please read our documentation:

* [Add a team member to Site Sharing](/documentation/developer-articles/add-a-team-member-to-site-sharing/)
* [Remove a team member from Site Sharing](/documentation/developer-articles/remove-a-team-member-from-site-sharing/)
* [Edit a team member's Site Sharing Permission Group](/documentation/developer-articles/edit-a-team-members-site-sharing-permission-group/)

## Client Sharing

You can share a specific *Site* with collaborators who do not have CloudCannon accounts and configure a simplified *Site* interface for them. Clients can log in using a Site-specific password and make changes to your content.

For a more in-depth explanation of *Client Sharing*, please read our documentation:

* [Turn on Client Sharing for a Site](/documentation/developer-articles/turn-on-client-sharing-for-a-site/)
* [Configure the commit details for clients](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-the-commit-details-for-clients/)
* [Customize the Client Sharing Permission Group](/documentation/developer-articles/customize-the-client-sharing-permission-group/)
* [Configure the Client login page](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-the-client-login-page/)
* [Configure the Client Dashboard support links](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-the-client-dashboard-support-links/)

## SSO/SAML

<comp.Notice info_type="pricing">
  **This feature is available on our** [**Enterprise plans**](/pricing/)**.**
</comp.Notice>

CloudCannon supports <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/sso.yml">Single Sign-On</comp.GlossaryTerm> using a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). By configuring SSO/SAML, you can authenticate your team members through an external application when they log in to CloudCannon.

For a more in-depth explanation of SSO/SAML, please read our documentation:

* [What is SSO/SAML?](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-sso-saml/)
* [Add SSO/SAML authentication](/documentation/developer-articles/add-sso-saml-authentication/)
* [Edit SSO/SAML authentication](/documentation/developer-articles/edit-sso-saml-authentication/)
* [Remove SSO/SAML authentication](/documentation/developer-articles/remove-sso-saml-authentication/)

## Multi-factor Authentication

Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) adds a second factor to your login process, typically a code from an authenticator app. This helps protect your account even if your password is compromised. Organization Owners can optionally require MFA for all team members.

For a more in-depth explanation of Multi-factor Authentication, please read our documentation:

* [Enable Multi-factor Authentication](/documentation/developer-articles/enable-multi-factor-authentication/)
* [Enforce Multi-factor Authentication](/documentation/developer-articles/enforce-multi-factor-authentication/)
