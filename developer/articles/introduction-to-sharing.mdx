Sharing in CloudCannon enables you to invite people to edit and review your content, maintain your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site.yml">Sites</comp.GlossaryTerm>, and manage your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/o/organization.yml">Organization</comp.GlossaryTerm>.

Articles in this section are helpful for developers responsible for configuring access control, Permission Groups, and sharing options in CloudCannon.

There are multiple ways to control how you share your content in CloudCannon. You can specify which content your team is allowed to edit, select which <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/t/team-member.yml">team members</comp.GlossaryTerm> can perform privileged actions (such as managing your billing or approving changes to your live website), and hide actions and files from the CloudCannon interface to create a more intuitive experience for non-technical team members.

In the Sharing section of our Developer documentation, we cover:

* Organization team members — Learn what a team member is and how to add or remove them from your Organization
* Permission Groups — Learn what a Permission Group is and what permissions are included in CloudCannon's Default Permission Groups
* Custom Permission Groups — Learn how to create your own Permission Groups and specify which resources Group members can access
* Site Sharing — Learn how to give a team member permission to access a specific Site in your Organization
* Client Sharing — Learn how to create a site-specific password to share your content with people outside of CloudCannon
* SSO/SAML — Learn how to set up Single Sign-On for greater security

Let’s briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## Organization team members

Team members are people you have invited to your [Organization](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-an-organization/). Your team members will help you manage your content and account administration. The maximum number of team members allowed per Organization will depend on your [pricing plan](/pricing/).

For a more in-depth explanation of Organization team members, including how to add and remove team members or join and leave Organizations, please read our documentation:

* [What is a team member?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-team-member/)

## Permission Groups

In CloudCannon, permissions determine what actions a team member is allowed to perform in your Organization. The Permission Groups a team member belongs to will determine what permissions they have.

CloudCannon offers several Default Permission Groups, allowing Organization Owners to decide the appropriate level of access for each team member. For Team and Enterprise plan customers, CloudCannon also offers the capacity to create Custom Permission Groups, so Owners can decide exactly what resources each member is allowed to interact with and how.

For a more in-depth explanation of Permission Groups, including how to manage your Groups and those of your team members, what permissions are included in the Default Permission Groups, and how to create Custom Permission Groups, please read our documentation:

* [What are Permission Groups?](/documentation/user-articles/what-are-permission-groups/)
* [What are Default Permission Groups?](/documentation/user-articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/)
* [What are Custom Permission Groups?](/documentation/developer-articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/)
* [Create a Custom Permission Group](/documentation/developer-articles/create-a-custom-permission-group/)
* [Delete a Custom Permission Group](/documentation/developer-articles/delete-a-custom-permission-group/)
* [Edit a Custom Permission Group](/documentation/developer-articles/edit-a-custom-permission-group/)
* [Best practices for Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/developer-articles/best-practices-for-custom-permission-groups/)

## Site Sharing

Site Sharing allows you to provide a team member access to an individual Site rather than all Sites in your Organization. You can use Site Sharing to share as many Sites as you need to with a single team member. CloudCannon provides two Permission Groups for Site Sharing team members so that you can select the correct level of access for each member.

For a more in-depth explanation of Site Sharing, including how to add and remove team members or switch a member’s Site Sharing Permission Group, please read our documentation:

* [Share a Site with Site Sharing](/documentation/user-articles/share-a-site-with-site-sharing/)
* [Add a team member to Site Sharing](/documentation/developer-articles/add-a-team-member-to-site-sharing/)
* [Remove a team member from Site Sharing](/documentation/developer-articles/remove-a-team-member-from-site-sharing/)
* [Edit a team member's Site Sharing Permission Group](/documentation/developer-articles/edit-a-team-members-site-sharing-permission-group/)

## Client Sharing

Client Sharing allows you to share a Site with someone who does not have a CloudCannon account by creating a Site-specific password. Clients can log in to your Site with this password and edit content through a pared-back version of the CloudCannon interface. Each Site with Client Sharing will contribute to the number of team members allowed per Organization.

For a more in-depth explanation of Client Sharing, including how to turn on Client Sharing, configure Client commit messages, and add support links to the Client Dashboard, please read our documentation:

* [What is Client Sharing?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-client-sharing/)
* [Turn on Client Sharing for a Site](/documentation/developer-articles/turn-on-client-sharing-for-a-site/)
* [Configure the commit details for clients](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-the-commit-details-for-clients/)
* [Customize the Client Sharing Permission Group](/documentation/developer-articles/customize-the-client-sharing-permission-group/)
* [Configure the Client login page](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-the-client-login-page/)
* [Configure the Client Dashboard support links](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-the-client-dashboard-support-links/)

## SSO/SAML

CloudCannon supports Single Sign-On (SSO) using a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for customers on our [Enterprise plan](/pricing/). SSO/SAML provides a way to authenticate your team through an external application and communicate that authentication to CloudCannon.

For a more in-depth explanation of SSO/SAML, including how to configure SSO/SAML in CloudCannon, please read our documentation:

* [What is SSO/SAML?](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-sso-saml/)
* [Add SSO/SAML authentication](/documentation/developer-articles/add-sso-saml-authentication/)
* [Edit SSO/SAML authentication](/documentation/developer-articles/edit-sso-saml-authentication/)
* [Remove SSO/SAML authentication](/documentation/developer-articles/remove-sso-saml-authentication/)
