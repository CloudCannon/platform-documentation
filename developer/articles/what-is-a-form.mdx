<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  This feature is only available for Sites [hosted through CloudCannon](/documentation/articles/what-is-web-hosting/#hosting-on-cloud-cannon). If you host your Site externally, or use CloudCannon in [Headless Mode](/documentation/articles/what-is-headless-mode/), this feature will not work.
</comp.Notice>

CloudCannon forms allow you to collect information submitted by visitors to your website without requiring a backend server.

You can view all the submitted data in your CloudCannon inbox, forward submissions to an email address of your choice, or use webhooks to forward submission data to a supported third-party app.

CloudCannon currently supports:

* [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/)
* [Make](https://www.make.com/en)
* [Slack](https://slack.com/)
* [Zapier](https://zapier.com/)

You can also export all form submission from CloudCannon.

To use CloudCannon forms, you must [create a forms inbox](/documentation/articles/create-a-forms-inbox/), [connect a form inbox to your Site](/documentation/articles/connecting-your-site-to-an-inbox/), and add form fields to a page. You can also [view form submissions](/documentation/articles/viewing-your-form-submissions-in-cloudcannon/) through the *Inbox* link in your *Site Navigation*, [configure form submissions forwarding](/documentation/articles/configure-form-submission-forwarding/), and protect your forms from spam and bot activity by adding [CAPTCHA](/documentation/articles/what-is-captcha/).

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  If you are using CloudCannon [legacy forms](/documentation/articles/legacy-form-documentation/), we highly recommend migrating to our current forms. For more information, please read our guide on [migrating from legacy forms](/documentation/guides/legacy-forms-migration/).
