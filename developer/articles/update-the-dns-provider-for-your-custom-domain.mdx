<comp.Notice info_type="permissions">
  **Permissions required**

  Members of the Owners or Developers [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/), or [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/) with the `base-domain:settings:dns` permission, can edit the DNS provider for a Custom Domain.
</comp.Notice>

When you first [connect a Custom Domain to your Organization](https://exuberant-baseball.cloudvent.net/documentation/articles/connect-a-custom-domain-to-your-organization/), CloudCannon requires you to select a DNS provider for your domain. You can update your DNS provider at any time.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Updating your DNS provider can cause downtime for anything connected to your domain, such as your website or custom email address. Please make sure you have a copy of your existing DNS records before you change providers.

  If you need help updating your DNS, please contact our friendly [support team](/support/).
</comp.Notice>

CloudCannon periodically removes the DNS records for Custom Domains that no longer use CloudCannon DNS. Please ensure you have a correct copy of your DNS record details before you switch from CloudCannon DNS to External DNS.

These instructions assume you have [connected a Custom Domain to your Organization](/documentation/articles/connect-a-custom-domain-to-your-organization/).

To update the DNS provider for your Custom Domain:

1. Log in to CloudCannon and select the Organization with the Custom Domain you want to update.
2. Click the *Domains* button in the *App Sidebar*. CloudCannon will open the *Domains browser*.
3. Identify the domain you want to update and click on the *Domain* card. CloudCannon will open the *Domain* page for this Custom Domain.
4. Navigate to the *Details* section under the *Domain Settings* tab.
5. Use the radio buttons under *DNS Provider* to select either *CloudCannon DNS* or *External DNS*.
6. Click the *Update Domain* button.

CloudCannon will update the expected DNS provider for your Custom Domain.

If you switch to CloudCannon DNS, you may have to configure your nameservers and add DNS records. For more information, please read our documentation on [configuring your nameservers](/documentation/articles/configure-your-nameservers-for-cloudcannon-dns/) and [managing DNS records using CloudCannon DNS](/documentation/articles/manage-dns-records-using-cloudcannon-dns/).

If you switch to External DNS, you may have to update your DNS records on your DNS provider. For more information, please read our documentation on [configuring external DNS](/documentation/articles/configure-external-dns/).
