## Disable setup prompts

During the onboarding and Site creation process, CloudCannon will guide you using setup prompts in your *Site Navigation*. By default, these prompts disappear from the *Site Navigation* once you have completed you Site setup, but they can return if CloudCannon detects your Site no longer has the minimum recommended configuration (e.g., you delete your [CloudCannon configuration file](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-cloudcannon-configuration-file/)).

You can disable these prompts by checking the *Disable setup prompts* flag on the *Flags* page of your Site, under *Site Settings*.

If you disable this flag, CloudCannon will not be able to warn you about incomplete setup in your *Site Navigation*. Instead you can find these warnings under the *Needs attention* section on your *Status* page.
