<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  <p>As of October 2024, CloudCannon uses the Unified Configuration format for your CloudCannon configuration file by default for all new Sites. Site created before this data can also upgrade to the Unified Configuration format.</p><p>For more information, please read our guide on <a href="/documentation/developer-guides/unified-configuration-migration-guide/">migrating to Unified Configuration</a> or contact our friendly <a href="/support/">support team</a>.</p>
</comp.Notice>

These flags may not be visible to all users depending on your Site and Organization configuration.

## Step 1: Enable live configuration and data reloading

The *Enable live configuration and data reloading* flag controls whether CloudCannon will automatically load changes to your data and configuration files without the need for a build. Enabling this flag may override the configuration from your last successful build.

All Sites can enable this behavior independantly from migrating to the Unified Configuration file format. You can enable this behavior by checking the *Enable live configuration and data reloading* flag on the *Flags* page of your Site, under *Site Settings*.

For more information, please read our documentation on [Live Configuration and Data Editing](/documentation/developer-guides/unified-configuration-migration-guide/live-configuration-and-data-editing/).

## Step 2: Use Unified Configuration

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Please do not enable this flag before reading our [migration guide](/documentation/developer-guides/unified-configuration-migration-guide/).
</comp.Notice>

The *Use Unified Configuration* flag controls whether CloudCannon will expect your CloudCannon configuration file to be in the Unified Configuration file format. All Sites created on new Organizations after October 2024 use Unified Configuration by default.

You can enable this behavior by checking the *Use Unified Configuration* flag on the *Flags* page of your Site, under *Site Settings*.

You can also enable this behavior on an Organization level checking the *Use Unified Configuration* flag on the *Flags* page of your Site, under *Org Settings*. This Organization level flag will ensure all new Sites created in your Organization use the Unified Configuration format.
