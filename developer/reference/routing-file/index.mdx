  title: Routing File
---
Routing determines what content is returned to a visitor's browser when they request a URL. Custom routing allows you to extend the default behavior.

This reference covers all keys available in CloudCannon for configuring your `routing.json` file. For more information, please read our documentation on [Routing](/documentation/articles/what-is-routing/) in general and [configuring custom routing](/documentation/articles/configure-custom-routing/).

All custom routing options are configured in the `routing.json` file in the `.cloudcannon` folder within your root directory.

For IDE autocomplete and validation, see our [JSON Schemas and TypeScript Types](/documentation/developer-reference/#json-schemas-and-typescript-types).
