Welcome to CloudCannon's Developer Reference. This section contains complete documentation for all configuration files and settings available in CloudCannon.

## Configuration File

The CloudCannon configuration file (`cloudcannon.config.*`) is the primary way to customize your CloudCannon experience. It controls collections, inputs, editing interfaces, and much more.

[View Configuration File Reference](/documentation/developer-reference/configuration-file/)

## Initial Site Settings File

The initial site settings file (`.cloudcannon/initial-site-settings.json`) streamlines the Site creation process by pre-configuring your SSG, hosting mode, and build settings.

[View Initial Site Settings Reference](/documentation/developer-reference/initial-site-settings-file/)

## Routing File

The routing file (`.cloudcannon/routing.json`) configures custom redirects and HTTP headers for CloudCannon hosted Sites.

## Permissions

Permissions control what actions your team members can perform within your Organization. Configure these through Permission Groups.
