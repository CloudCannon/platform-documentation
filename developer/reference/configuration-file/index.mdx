Your CloudCannon configuration file allows you to customize your app experience by configuring CloudCannon's appearance and functionality.

This reference covers all keys available in your CloudCannon configuration file. To learn more about the configuration file, please read our documentation on the [CloudCannon configuration file](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-cloudcannon-configuration-file/).

The configuration file can be named `cloudcannon.config.yml`, `cloudcannon.config.yaml`, `cloudcannon.config.json`, `cloudcannon.config.cjs`, or `cloudcannon.config.js` and should be placed in the root directory of your repository.
