  title: Initial Site Settings File
---
When you create a new Site on CloudCannon, the syncing and building steps require you to provide values for your Site configuration (e.g., SSG, hosting mode, and build commands). Rather than enter these details during Site creation, you can configure them in an initial site settings file.

The `/.cloudcannon/initial-site-settings.json` file is useful for streamlining your Site creation process. If you manage website templates or a Site repository that you might upload to CloudCannon multiple times, specifying your build configuration in advance will make this process more efficient.

You can update these values in your *Site Settings* at any time. CloudCannon only uses the initial site settings file during Site creation.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If you create a Site by branching an existing one, CloudCannon will copy the Site settings from the original branch and ignore the initial Site settings file.
