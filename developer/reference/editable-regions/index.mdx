  title: Permissions
---
Permissions control what actions your team members can perform within your [Organization](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-organization/). The permissions of each team member are determined by which [Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-permission-groups/) they belong to. For each Permission Group, you can configure a set of permissions and give those permissions to every Group member.

<comp.Notice info_type="pricing">
  **This feature is available on our Team and Enterprise plans.**

  In CloudCannon, [default](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/) and [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/) are available depending on your [pricing plan](/pricing/). You cannot configure the permissions for Default Permission Groups.
</comp.Notice>

For more information about permission groups, please read our documentation on [Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-permission-groups/) in general, [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/), or [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/).
