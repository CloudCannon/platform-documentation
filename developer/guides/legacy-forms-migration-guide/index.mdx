The new CloudCannon forms offer improved compatibility with new SSGs, reduced build times, and increased security. This guide will provide you with all the resources you need to safely migrate your existing legacy forms to the new CloudCannon forms.

If you were using legacy forms on a site, CloudCannon will have automatically created and attached a new forms Inbox to that site. That Inbox will have a single *Legacy* target, so your forms will continue working normally until you're ready to migrate.
