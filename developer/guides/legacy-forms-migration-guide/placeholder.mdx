### Migrating email forms

To migrate a legacy email form, you can follow this guide for forwarding from an Inbox to email. Your target value will be the email address in your `_to` input. The new email target only supports a single address, so if you have multiple addresses in your `_to` input or you're using the `_cc` input you'll have to create a target for each of those addresses individually.

### Migrating hooks forms

To migrate a legacy webhook form, you can follow the guide for integrating CloudCannon forms with your specific service:

* [IFTTT](/documentation/articles/integrating-your-forms-with-ifttt/)
* [Integromat](/documentation/articles/integrating-your-forms-with-integromat/)
* [Zapier](/documentation/articles/integrating-your-forms-with-zapier/)
  Your target value will be the webhook URL in your `_hook` input.

### Removing your legacy target

Once you have set up your new targets, you're now ready to remove your *Legacy* target from your Inbox.

To remove your *Legacy* target:

1. Remove all `_to`, `_cc`, and `_hook` inputs from your legacy forms. It's important to do this first so that you don't leak any private information after you delete your *Legacy* target and the form is no longer encrypted.
2. Navigate to the forms menu in your Organization settings, under *Hosting &gt; Forms.*
3. Click the *Manage* button on the Inbox connected to your site.
4. Open the context menu for the *Legacy* target with the three dots button, and click *Delete.*

With the *Legacy* target removed, CloudCannon will skip the encrypting forms on your site for all future builds. Your form's previously encrypted details will persist until your site next builds.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Legacy forms are deprecated. It is recommended that you migrate to the new  forms feature. This will speed up your build process and enable a new range of features. Legacy forms will not work with all SSGs.
</comp.Notice>

Create forms on your site and send the submissions to an email address or integrate with your own workflows.

To create a form:

1. Add an HTML form to a page
2. Set the `method` attribute to **post**
3. Set the `action` to where the visitor is redirected after the form submission
4. Add form fields with `name` attributes to collect data from visitors

<comp.CodeBlock language="html" source="contact.html">
```
<form method="post" action="/success.html">
  <label>Email Address</label>
  <input type="text" name="email">

  <label>Name</label>
  <input type="text" name="name">

  <label>Message</label>
  <textarea name="message"></textarea>

  <label>Urgent</label>
  <input type="checkbox" name="urgent">

  <label>Type of Enquiry</label>
  <input type="radio" name="_subject" value="Sales Enquiry"> Sales
  <input type="radio" name="_subject" value="General Enquiry"> General

  <input type="hidden" name="_to" value="sales@example.com,support@example.com">
  <input type="hidden" name="_cc" value="sales.tracker@example.com">
  <input type="text" name="_gotcha" style="display: none;">

  <input type="submit" value="Send Message">
</form>
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

CloudCannon sends named form data to email addresses of your choosing. Alternatively, [use a hook](/documentation/developer-articles/extending-your-build-process-with-hooks/#webhooks) to integrate with services like Zapier or IFTTT.

## Special Fields

Use these fields to customize the email CloudCannon sends through the form. The fields can be hidden or visible, depending on your requirements.

`_to` *(required)* - the address (or addresses) that CloudCannon sends the email to. Send the email to multiple addresses by separating them with commas.

If a `_hook` is defined, this field will not be used.

<comp.CodeBlock language="html" source="contact.html">
```
<input type="hidden" name="_to" value="contact@example.com">
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

`_replyto` or `email` - the value used for the Reply-To header in the email. Use this to ensure clients reply to the visitor rather than a default CloudCannon address.

<comp.CodeBlock language="html" source="contact.html">
```
<label>
  Your Email Address
  <input type="text" name="_replyto">
</label>
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

`_subject` - the subject of the email.

<comp.CodeBlock language="html" source="contact.html">
```
<select name="_subject">
  <option>General Enquiry</option>
  <option>Quote Request</option>
  <option>Support</option>
</select>
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

`_cc` - the value used for the CC header in the email. Use this to send a copy in another address (or addresses) without sending it directly. Send a copy of the email to multiple addresses by separating them with commas.

<comp.CodeBlock language="html" source="contact.html">
```
<input type="hidden" name="_cc" value="contact@example.com">
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

`_hook` - instead of sending an email, a webhook can be supplied for the data to be sent to. See [Webhooks](#using-webhooks) for configuration details.

<comp.CodeBlock language="html" source="contact.html">
```
<input type="hidden" name="_hook" value="https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/1234567/abcdef/">
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

`_gotcha` - honeypot field for preventing untargeted spam. CloudCannon does **not** send the email if this field has a value. Hide it with CSS to prevent visitors filling it out.

<comp.CodeBlock language="html" source="contact.html">
```
<input type="text" name="_gotcha" style="display: none;">
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  For better spam prevention try using [Google reCAPTCHA](/documentation/developer-articles/reducing-spam-by-adding-google-recaptcha/).
</comp.Notice>

## Security

these fields are encrypted before being served to protect your information and prevent spam.

* `_to`
* `_cc`
* `_hook`

## Submitting with AJAX

Submitting a form with JavaScript saves a page load after sending a message, providing a seamless experience. Viewers without JavaScript enabled will fall back to the normal flow.

To submit your form with JavaScript:

1. Build and test your form
2. Override the submit event on your form
3. Change the page to notify your viewers the message was sent

Start with this JavaScript snippet and adapt it for your site:

<comp.CodeBlock language="javascript" source="script.js">
```
// Helper function to get form data in the supported format
function getFormDataString(formEl) {
    var formData = new FormData(formEl),
      data = [];

  for (var keyValue of formData) {
      data.push(encodeURIComponent(keyValue[0]) + "=" + encodeURIComponent(keyValue[1]));
  }

  return data.join("&");
}

// Fetch the form element
var formEl = document.getElementById("contact-form");

// Override the submit event
formEl.addEventListener("submit", function (e) {
    e.preventDefault();

  if (grecaptcha) {
      var recaptchaResponse = grecaptcha.getResponse();
    if (!recaptchaResponse) { // reCAPTCHA not clicked yet
      return false;
    }
  }

  var request = new XMLHttpRequest();

  request.addEventListener("load", function () {
    if (request.status === 302) { // CloudCannon redirects on success
      // It worked
    }
  });

  request.open(formEl.method, formEl.action);
  request.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
  request.send(getFormDataString(formEl));
});
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

## Using Webhooks

Create your own workflow around form submissions.

The `_hook` field allows you to supply a webhook that you control to process the form submission. The data is sent as a **POST** request with the Content Type `application/json`.

We currently allow hooks from the following platforms to be used:

* [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) - [*Documentation*](https://zapier.com/help/create/code-webhooks)
* [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) - [*Help Page*](https://help.ifttt.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010230347-The-Webhooks-Service)

If you have use cases beyond these platforms, [send us a message](/support/).

#### IFTTT

Note that IFTTT does not support custom **JSON** keys. Webhook Applets have access to the three keys `value1`, `value2` and `value3`, the quantity and naming is fixed. This means that you will have to reflect this structure in your form. For example:

<comp.CodeBlock language="html" source="contact.html">
```
<label>Email Address</label>
<input type="email" name="value1">
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Zapier does not have a limitation on the number of fields or custom keys.

## Rate Limiting

Forms hosted on CloudCannon are limited to 750 submissions per 10 days. [Contact us](https://cloudcannon.com/contact) if you need this limit expanded.
