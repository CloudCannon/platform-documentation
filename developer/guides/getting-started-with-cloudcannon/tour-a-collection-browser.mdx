The next task in the *Getting Started with Editing* in-app guide is *Tour a Collection Browser*, which will point out important UI in the *Collection Browser*. If you would rather continue configuring CloudCannon, feel free to skip this task.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Tour-Collections-Task" alt="A screenshot of the Tour a Collection Browser task in the Getting Started in-app guide shows a Start your tour button." title="The Site Dashboard" type="ui-snippet"/>

The *Collections* you selected in the *Edit Collections* modal are visible in your *Site Navigation*. Click on a *Collection* to open the *Collection Browser*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Navigation-New-Collections" alt="A screenshot of the Site Navigation shows that several Collections are now present." title="The Site Navigation" type="ui-snippet"/>

You may notice that several UI elements in your *Collections Browser* are purple. That's because these elements are all configurable, allowing you to customize your CloudCannon experience using *Configuration Mode*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Configuration-Mode-On" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows several UI elements highlighted in Configuration Mode purple." title="The Collection Browser" type="screenshot"/>

For now, let's hide this UI by clicking on the purple *Configuration Mode switch* on the right of your *Site Header* to turn it off.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Header-Tools" alt="A screenshot of the Site Header tools shows the Avatar List, Configuration Mode toggle, and the Save button with one unsaved change." title="The Site Header tools" type="ui-snippet"/>

Your *Collection Browser* allows you to browse, sort, and filter your *Collection* files, add new ones, and perform file actions like cloning or deleting.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Unconfigured-Collection" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows several tools for browsing, sorting, and filtering your Collection files." title="The Collection Browser" type="screenshot"/>

At the top of your *Collection Browser*, underneath your *Site Header*, is the *Collection Header*. This section contains important identifying information about your *Collection*, such as the *Name*, and *Documentation Link* or *Description* (if configured).

Under the *Collection Header* are the *Collection Browser Controls*: the *Sort* *menu*, *View* *menu*, *Filter* text field, and the *\+ Add menu*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser controls shows the Change sorting menu, Change view menu, Filter text field, and the + Add menu." title="The Collection Browser controls" type="ui-snippet"/>

The *Sort* *menu* allows you to change how CloudCannon sorts your Collection files. By default, you can sort your files alphabetically by file path, or numerically by file size, date and time of file creation, or date and time the file was last modified.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls-Sort-Dropdown" alt="A screenshot of the Change sorting menu in the Collection Browser shows a dropdown with several options for sorting Collection files." title="The Change sorting menu" type="ui-snippet"/>

The *View* *menu* allows you to change how your files appear in the *Collection Browser*. You can switch between three view options: *List*, *Card*, and *Gallery*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls-View-Dropdown" alt="A screenshot of the Change view menu in the Collection Browser shows a dropdown with several options for Collection file appearance." title="The Change view menu" type="ui-snippet"/>

The default view in your *Collection Browser* is the *Gallery* view. When the *Gallery* view option is selected, the *Collection Browser* displays the file name, file path (if it is an output *Collection*), the icon for the *Collection*, and has a gallery section for each file in a rectangular *Card*. The gallery section of the *Card* can display an image from within the file or a preview screenshot of the webpage.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-View-Gallery" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows files in Gallery view, with an image section for each file." title="The Collection Browser in Gallery view" type="screenshot"/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p>The gallery section of your <em>File</em> <em>Card</em> can also display a "No preview available" or "Failed to load image" warning.</p><p>"No preview available" indicates that the preview screenshot has not been configured. This will be the case for Sites that have not been built. We'll cover screenshots more in the <a href="/documentation/guides/set-up-visual-editing/">Set up Visual Editing</a> guide.</p><p>"Failed to load image" indicates that an error has occurred, and CloudCannon could not load the preview screenshot. Refreshing your browser may fix this.</p>
</comp.Notice>

When the *Card* view option is selected, the *Collection Browser* displays the file name, file path, and the icon for the Collection for each file in a rectangular *Card*. This is similar to the *Gallery* view, except without a section for an image.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-View-Card" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows files in Card view." title="The Collection Browser in Card view" type="screenshot"/>

When the *List* view option is selected, the *Collection Browser* displays the file name, file path, and the icon for the Collection for each file in a horizontal *Card*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-View-List" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows files in List view." title="The Collection Browser in List view" type="screenshot"/>

By typing in the *Filter* text field, you can filter your Collection files to show file paths that match a given string.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls-Filtered-Files" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows that a text string in the Collection Filter has filtered the files shown." title="The Collection Browser" type="screenshot"/>

The *\+ Add* button allows you to add new files and folders to a Collection, which you can save back to your Git repository.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls-Add-Menu-Dropdown" alt="A screenshot of the + Add menu in the Collection Browser shows a dropdown with options to add a new file or folder." title="The + Add menu" type="ui-snippet"/>

In the next step of this guide, we'll cover how to save your *Configuration File* back to your Git repository.
