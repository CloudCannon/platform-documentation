After you create your account, CloudCannon will open your *Organization Home* page.

<comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/o/organization.yml">Organizations</comp.GlossaryTerm> are the highest level of content management on CloudCannon, containing all your websites, team members, and resources in CloudCannon. When you sign up, CloudCannon will automatically create an *Organization* for you.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p>You can also join other people's <em>Organizations</em> by invitation, which will allow you to manage their content.</p>
</comp.Notice>

To help you get started on CloudCannon, the *Home* page of your *Organization* has an in-app guide called *Getting Started: Setting up your Organization*. These tasks provide a list of goals for optimally setting up CloudCannon.

We'll cover the first few tasks in this guide: *Welcome Tour*, *Create a Site*, *Authenticate with a Git provider*, and *Create a Site from a Git repository*. The remaining optional *Organization* tasks are covered in other guides.

Each task has a heading, description, and documentation link.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  **A quick note about Documentation...**

  CloudCannon links to helpful documentation in multiple places throughout the App. When you see the question mark symbol next to a link, or on its own next to a title, clicking on it will open the relevant page on the CloudCannon Documentation website in a modal.

  <comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Organization-Home-Task-Title-Inline-Docs-Link" alt="A screenshot of the title of an onboarding task shows the blue open book icon, indicating a relevant docs link for this topic." title="Task with inline docs link" type="ui-snippet"/>
</comp.Notice>

The first task in the in-app guide is *Welcome Tour*. You can click the *Start your tour* button or, if you would rather go straight to configuring your first *Site*, skip this step of the guide.

Let's take a look at some of the UI for your *Organization*.

On the left is the *App Sidebar*. This contains several tools for managing your *Organization* and *Account*. At the top are links to your *Home*, *Sites*, *Projects*, *Domains*, and *Org Settings* pages. We'll cover each of these in greater detail later, or in other guides relevant to those sections. For now, it's important to note the link to the *Home* page at the top of the *App Sidebar*. If you get stuck, return to this page for more guidance.

At the bottom of the *App Sidebar* is the *Updates* button and your *Account Menu*. Clicking on the *Updates* button will open the *App Updates* modal with a list of CloudCannon's most recent changelogs.

Clicking on your *Avatar* and *Name* will open the *Account Menu*. Here you can find a link to your *Account Settings*, message our friendly [support team](/support/), and log out of CloudCannon with the *Log Out* button, as well as navigate to other *Organizations* (if you are a member of multiple Orgs).

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-App-Sidebar-Account-Menu" alt="A screenshot of the footer of the App Sidebar shows links for the Updates modal and the Account Menu." title="The App Sidebar Footer" type="ui-snippet"/>

Now that you are more acquainted with your *Organization*, let's add your website files. In the next step of this guide, we'll create a *Site* from our website Git repository and sync our files to CloudCannon.
