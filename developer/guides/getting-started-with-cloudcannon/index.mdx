Welcome to the Getting Started with CloudCannon guide!

This guide is an excellent starting point for developers new to CloudCannon. We recommend that you complete this guide first, as other developer guides on the CloudCannon Documentation website may rely on the steps outlined here.

CloudCannon is a Git-based Content Management System designed to help teams (or individuals) manage their website content and code. Developers can commit changes to a Git repository that syncs to CloudCannon. At the same time, CloudCannon provides an interface that allows non-technical team members to effortlessly update the content stored in your Git repository, without needing to know anything about Git, Markdown, or HTML. All your files are stored safely and securely in your Git repository — no vendor lock-in.

In this guide, we'll cover how to create an account, add your files to a *Site*, and set yourself up for success on CloudCannon with a *Configuration File* and *Collections*. By the end of this guide, you will have set up a basic *Site* in CloudCannon with WYSIWYG editing, ready for you to manage your content.

Before we begin, this guide assumes you already have a website and your files are uploaded to a Git repository. Although you can <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/developer-articles/create-a-site-with-direct-upload/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upload files directly</a> from your local storage, we highly recommend using a Git repository.
