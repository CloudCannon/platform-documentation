The next task in the *Getting Started with Editing* in-app guide is to *Create your CloudCannon Configuration File*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-No-Config" alt="A screenshot of the Site Dashboard shows the Getting Started in-app guide with a task to create your CloudCannon Configuration File." title="The Site Dashboard" type="screenshot"/>

The *CloudCannon Configuration File* is the heart of your CloudCannon experience, allowing you to customize the functionality and appearance of your *Site*. You can configure your *Site Navigation*, Editing Interfaces, file appearance in the app, how CloudCannon adds new files, and more by adding formatted content to your *Configuration File*.

As we go through the later steps of this guide, we'll add more to our *Configuration File*. Let's create one.

Click the *\+ Create my Configuration File* button in your in-app guide under the *Create your CloudCannon Configuration File* task. CloudCannon will open the *Create my Configuration File* modal.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Create-Config-File-Task" alt="A screenshot of the Create your CloudCannon Configuration File task from the Getting Started in-app guide shows the Create my Configuration File button." title="The Create a Configuration File task" type="ui-snippet"/>

The *CloudCannon Configuration File* is stored at the root of your website directory by default and can be YAML or JSON. When you answer the questions in this modal, CloudCannon will create the `/cloudcannon.config.yml` file in the root of your repository.

## Select your *Static Site Generator*

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Create-Config-File-Modal" alt="A screenshot of the Create my Configuration File modal shows a dropdown for selecting your SSG and a checkbox for Use a custom source." title="The Create my Configuration File modal" type="screenshot"/>

To start with, CloudCannon needs to know which <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/ssg.yml">Static Site Generator</comp.GlossaryTerm> your *Site* uses. An SSG is a tool for generating a static HTML website from your files. CloudCannon supports various SSGs, from Astro, Eleventy, and Hugo to Jekyll, MkDocs, and Lume. You can choose whichever SSG is appropriate for your website files.

CloudCannon will use the information found in your files to suggest an *SSG*. You can click on the *Use* button under the right side of the *Static Site Generator* dropdown to populate it with CloudCannon's suggestion, or select an option from the list of CloudCannon's supported *SSGs*.

At the bottom of the *Create my Configuration File* modal is the *Preview* button. Clicking this button will show you a preview of the initial content of your *CloudCannon Configuration File*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Create-Config-File-Modal-Code" alt="A screenshot of the Create my Configuration File modal shows the initial content CloudCannon will add to your Configuration File." title="The Create my Configuration File modal" type="screenshot"/>

## Select your *Source Folder* (optional)

CloudCannon needs to know the base path for your SSG source files relative to the root of your directory, called the *Source Folder*. Most websites use the root of their repository as the *Source Folder*.

However, if your source is nested in your repository (such as if you have a mono-repo), you should check the *Use a custom source* box and enter the file path in the *Source Folder* text field.

## Select your *Collections*

Click the *Next* button on the bottom right of the *Create my Configuration File* modal.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Add-Collections-Modal" alt="A screenshot of the Create my Configuration File modal shows a tree structure of potential Collections detected in your files." title="The Create my Configuration File modal" type="screenshot"/>

On the next page of the modal, CloudCannon asks you to select your *Collections*. A <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/c/collection.yml">Collection</comp.GlossaryTerm> is a group of files you want to edit in CloudCannon, and will match a folder in your *Git Repository* (e.g., a folder of pages, blog posts, product descriptions, or data files).

Once you select your *Collections,* they will appear in your *Site Navigation* for easy access. On the right of the modal, you can see a preview of the default name and icon CloudCannon will assign to each *Collection* (you can change these later), along with the number of content files each *Collection* will contain.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Add-Collections-Modal-Detected-Collection" alt="A screenshot of a detected Collection in the Create my Configuration File modal." title="A Detected Collection" type="ui-snippet"/>

CloudCannon will automatically detect which folders in your *Git Repository* contain content files and suggest that you turn these into *Collections*. By default, suggested *Collections* are checked in the *Create my Configuration File* modal. If you are happy with these *Collections*, click the *Create my Configuration File* button at the bottom of the modal, and CloudCannon will add `cloudcannon.config.yml` to the root of your repository.

Alternatively, you can deselect any folders you don't want to edit in CloudCannon using the checkbox before clicking the *Create my Configuration File* button.

Congratulations! You've made your first change to your website content: adding a file. You might notice that the *Save* button in the top right now has a red "1" notification. This indicates that you have made a change to one file. Don't click the *Save* button just yet—we'll talk about saving changes to your *Site* in the [save your Configuration File](/documentation/developer-guides/getting-started-with-cloudcannon/save-your-configuration-file/) step of this guide.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Header-Tools" alt="A screenshot of the Site Header tools shows the Avatar List, Configuration Mode toggle, and the Save button with one unsaved change." title="The Site Header tools" type="ui-snippet"/>

You might also notice a new UI element next to the *Save* button. This is the *Configuration Mode switch*. Now that we have a *Configuration File*, we can use *Configuration Mode* to customize our *Site* and store our preferences.

In the next step of this guide, we'll use *Configuration Mode* to group our files into user-friendly *Collections*.
