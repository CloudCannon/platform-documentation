The next task in the *Getting Started with Editing* in-app guide is *Tour your new Site*, which points out important UI on your new *Site*. If you would rather continue configuring CloudCannon, feel free to skip this task.

Click the *Start your tour* button and let CloudCannon show you around.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Tour-Site-Task" alt="A screenshot of the Site Dashboard shows the Getting Started in-app guide with a task to Tour your new Site." title="The Site Dashboard" type="ui-snippet"/>

## General *Site* UI

At the top of your *Site* is the *Site Header*, and on the left is the *Site Navigation* and *App Sidebar*.

The *Site Header* displays key information about your *Site* in the top left, such as your *Site* icon, name, and branch, and important tools in the top right, such as the *Avatars* of all the team members viewing a *Site* and the *Save* button. More tools will appear in your *Site Header* as you set up your *Site*.

The *Site Navigation*...

We introduced the *App Sidebar* in a [previous step of this guide](/documentation/developer-guides/getting-started-with-cloudcannon/your-organization-on-cloudcannon/). If you ever navigate away from your *Site* and need to find it again, you can click the *Sites* button in your *App sidebar* and use the *Sites Browser* to find it again.

## The *Site Dashboard*

The majority of your screen is taken up by your current *Site* page: in this case, the *Site Dashboard*. Your *Site Dashboard* is the homepage for your *Site*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Tour-Site-Task" alt="A screenshot of the Site Dashboard shows the Getting Started in-app guide with a task to Tour your new Site." title="The Site Dashboard" type="screenshot"/>

The *Site Dashboard* is the first link in your *Site Navigation*. Next to this link are the *Status* indicator and the *Guide progress* indicator, which show the status of your most recent sync and build and how far you have progressed through your active in-app guide.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

The *Site Dashboard* is broken down into several tabs, including *Summary*, *Activity*, *Syncs*, and *Guides*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-New-Site-Dashboard-Tabs" alt="A screenshot of the Site Dashboard tabs on a new Site shows the Summary, Activity, Syncs, and Guides tabs." title="The Site Dashboard Tabs" type="ui-snippet"/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Depending on how you configure your *Site*, additional tabs, such as *Builds* and *Build Deploys*, can appear on your *Site Dashboard*.
</comp.Notice>

On the *Summary* tab of your *Site Dashboard*, CloudCannon will display summary information about your *Site*. For new *Sites*, CloudCannon has the *Getting Started with Editing* in-app guide in the center, with suggested tasks for configuring your *Site*. Underneath the in-app guide is a list of your recent activity. On the right, the *Summary* tab also gives a preview of your most recent sync.

On the *Activity* tab of your *Site Dashboard*, CloudCannon will show you a list of recent activity on your *Site* in reverse chronological order. This list refreshes every time you sync your *Site* or update your *Site Settings*. This list includes:

* Every change made to your files from within CloudCannon or your Git provider (including the author, date, time, and commit message, if applicable).
* When your *Site* has Syncing or Output errors.
* Any changes made to your *Site Settings*, or *Branch* and *Publish Branch* settings.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-New-Site-Dashboard-Activity-Tab" alt="A screenshot of the Activity tab on the Site Dashboard shows two activity item." title="The Activity tab" type="screenshot"/>

On the *Syncs* tab of your *Site Dashboard*, CloudCannon will show you a list of syncing logs for your *Site* in reverse chronological order.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-New-Site-Dashboard-Syncs-Tab" alt="A screenshot of the Syncs tab on the Site Dashboard shows one Sync log." title="The Syncs tab" type="screenshot"/>

On the *Guides* tab of your *Site Dashboard*, CloudCannon will show you a list of in-app guides. You can see the number of available guides in a notification by the name of the tab.

Right now, we are working through *Getting Started with Editing*. There are several other guides you can follow to configure other features in CloudCannon after you have finished *Getting Started with Editing*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-New-Site-Dashboard-Guides-Tab" alt="A screenshot of the Guides tab on the Site Dashboard shows one active guide and several other available guides." title="The Guides tab" type="screenshot"/>

## The *Collection Browser*

When you selected your *Collections* in the [previous step of this guide](/documentation/developer-guides/getting-started-with-cloudcannon/create-your-cloudcannon-configuration-file/), CloudCannon added them to your *Site Navigation*. Click on one to open your *Collection Browser.*

## Using *Configuration Mode*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The *Collections* you selected in the *Edit Collections* modal are visible in your *Site Navigation*. Click on a *Collection* to open the *Collection Browser*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Navigation-New-Collections" alt="A screenshot of the Site Navigation shows that several Collections are now present." title="The Site Navigation" type="ui-snippet"/>

You may notice that several UI elements in your *Collections Browser* are purple. That's because these elements are all configurable, allowing you to customize your CloudCannon experience using *Configuration Mode*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Configuration-Mode-On" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows several UI elements highlighted in Configuration Mode purple." title="The Collection Browser" type="screenshot"/>

For now, let's hide this UI by clicking on the purple *Configuration Mode switch* on the right of your *Site Header* to turn it off.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Header-Tools" alt="A screenshot of the Site Header tools shows the Avatar List, Configuration Mode toggle, and the Save button with one unsaved change." title="The Site Header tools" type="ui-snippet"/>

Your *Collection Browser* allows you to browse, sort, and filter your *Collection* files, add new ones, and perform file actions like cloning or deleting.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Unconfigured-Collection" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows several tools for browsing, sorting, and filtering your Collection files." title="The Collection Browser" type="screenshot"/>

At the top of your *Collection Browser*, underneath your *Site Header*, is the *Collection Header*. This section contains important identifying information about your *Collection*, such as the *Name*, and *Documentation Link* or *Description* (if configured).

Under the *Collection Header* are the *Collection Browser Controls*: the *Sort* *menu*, *View* *menu*, *Filter* text field, and the *\+ Add menu*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser controls shows the Change sorting menu, Change view menu, Filter text field, and the + Add menu." title="The Collection Browser controls" type="ui-snippet"/>

The *Sort* *menu* allows you to change how CloudCannon sorts your Collection files. By default, you can sort your files alphabetically by file path, or numerically by file size, date and time of file creation, or date and time the file was last modified.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls-Sort-Dropdown" alt="A screenshot of the Change sorting menu in the Collection Browser shows a dropdown with several options for sorting Collection files." title="The Change sorting menu" type="ui-snippet"/>

The *View* *menu* allows you to change how your files appear in the *Collection Browser*. You can switch between three view options: *List*, *Card*, and *Gallery*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls-View-Dropdown" alt="A screenshot of the Change view menu in the Collection Browser shows a dropdown with several options for Collection file appearance." title="The Change view menu" type="ui-snippet"/>

The default view in your *Collection Browser* is the *Gallery* view. When the *Gallery* view option is selected, the *Collection Browser* displays the file name, file path (if it is an output *Collection*), the icon for the *Collection*, and has a gallery section for each file in a rectangular *Card*. The gallery section of the *Card* can display an image from within the file or a preview screenshot of the webpage.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-View-Gallery" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows files in Gallery view, with an image section for each file." title="The Collection Browser in Gallery view" type="screenshot"/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p>The gallery section of your <em>File</em> <em>Card</em> can also display a "No preview available" or "Failed to load image" warning.</p><p>"No preview available" indicates that the preview screenshot has not been configured. This will be the case for Sites that have not been built. We'll cover screenshots more in the <a href="/documentation/developer-guides/set-up-visual-editing/">Set up Visual Editing</a> guide.</p><p>"Failed to load image" indicates that an error has occurred, and CloudCannon could not load the preview screenshot. Refreshing your browser may fix this.</p>
</comp.Notice>

When the *Card* view option is selected, the *Collection Browser* displays the file name, file path, and the icon for the Collection for each file in a rectangular *Card*. This is similar to the *Gallery* view, except without a section for an image.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-View-Card" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows files in Card view." title="The Collection Browser in Card view" type="screenshot"/>

When the *List* view option is selected, the *Collection Browser* displays the file name, file path, and the icon for the Collection for each file in a horizontal *Card*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-View-List" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows files in List view." title="The Collection Browser in List view" type="screenshot"/>

By typing in the *Filter* text field, you can filter your Collection files to show file paths that match a given string.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls-Filtered-Files" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows that a text string in the Collection Filter has filtered the files shown." title="The Collection Browser" type="screenshot"/>

The *\+ Add* button allows you to add new files and folders to a Collection, which you can save back to your Git repository.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls-Add-Menu-Dropdown" alt="A screenshot of the + Add menu in the Collection Browser shows a dropdown with options to add a new file or folder." title="The + Add menu" type="ui-snippet"/>

In the next step of this guide, we'll cover how to save your *Configuration File* back to your Git repository.
