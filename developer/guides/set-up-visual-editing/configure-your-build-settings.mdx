    Learn how to enable Site builds on CloudCannon and configure your build
    settings for visual editing.
---
Before you can use the Visual Editor, you must have at least one successful build on CloudCannon.

Let's configure your build settings and complete a successful build. If you have already met these requirements, such as by completing the Host your website on the Internet guide, you can skip this step of the guide.

## Configure your build

To build your *Site*, CloudCannon needs to know a few details about how your website functions.

Click the *Configure your build* button in your in-app guide under the *Configure your Site's build settings* task.

CloudCannon will open the *Configure your build* modal.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Configure-Build-Modal" alt="A screenshot of the Configure your build modal." title="The Configure your build modal" type="screenshot"/>

CloudCannon can make suggestions for your build settings based on the SSG your *Site* uses and the contents of your files. You can enter your own build settings or accept a suggestion by clicking the *Use* button, and CloudCannon will populate the text field. If you are unsure about the correct build settings for your *Site*, please contact your developer or reach out to our friendly [support team](/support/).

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Build-Configuration-Install-Command-Suggestion" alt="A screenshot of the Install Command text field and CloudCannon's suggested value in a light blue box." title="The build suggestions box" type="ui-snippet"/>

Under the *Command line options* section, enter your *Install Command*, *Build Command*, *Output Path*, and *Environment Variables*. CloudCannon requires a value for *Output Path*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Build-Configuration-Command-Line-Options" alt="A screenshot of the Configure your build modal shows the command line options." title="The Configure your build modal" type="screenshot"/>

Under the *Build system options* section, enter your *Preserved Paths*, and choose whether you want to enable the *Preserve Output*, *Include .git folder*, and *Manually Configure URLs* settings.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Build-Configuration-Build-System-Options" alt="A screenshot of the Configure your build modal shows the build system options, including Preserved Paths." title="The Configure your build modal" type="screenshot"/>

Finally, under the *Library Versions* section, review the versions of *Hugo*, *Ruby*, *Node*, and *Deno*. If your website uses any of these libraries, please ensure the version number is correct.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Build-Configuration-Library-Versions" alt="A screenshot of the Configure your build modal shows the library versions for Hugo, Ruby, Node, and Deno." title="The Configure your build modal" type="screenshot"/>

When you are happy with your answers, click the *Update Configuration and Build* button. CloudCannon will start your first *Site* build using the configuration you defined.

## Your first build

Your first *Site* build should start immediately.

Whenever CloudCannon is building your *Site*, the *Building...* notification will appear in the bottom right of your screen. Clicking on the *View output* button on this notification will open the *Build output* modal.

The *Build output* modal displays the *Build log* for your current build. *Build logs* are useful for keeping track of your build progress and diagnosing any issues if your build fails.

You can access a list of all your past *Build logs* on the *Builds* tab of your *Site Dashboard*. CloudCannon added this tab to your *Dashboard* after you configured your first build.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Builds-Tab" alt="A screenshot of the Builds tab on the Site Dashboard shows a list of all past build logs for this Site." title="The Site Dashboard Builds tab" type="screenshot"/>

You can also see the progress of your most recent build on the *Summary* tab of your *Dashboard*, on the right under *Build*. You can trigger a new build at any time using the *Rebuild* button on the *Site Dashboard* or cancel a running build using the *Cancel build* button.

If your build fails, please reach out to our friendly [support team](/support/).

Once you have a successful build, a link to your [Testing Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-testing-domain/) will appear in your *Site Header*. You can click on this to see your live website in a new tab.

In the next step of this guide, we'll take a look at your output files and make sure CloudCannon has generated all the webpage previews you need for the Visual Editor.
