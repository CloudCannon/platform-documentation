    This key defines which structures are available for [Object inputs](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-object-input/) and [Array inputs](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-array-input/) at a given level of the configuration cascade.

    The following nested keys are available for each structure inside `_structures`:

    * `id_key`
    * `style`
    * `hide_extra_inputs`
    * `reorder_inputs`
    * `remove_empty_inputs`
    * `remove_extra_inputs`
    * `values` (required)

    This key has no default. If undefined at higher levels of the [configuration cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/), `_structures` will default to any values configured in the [CloudCannon configuration file](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-cloudcannon-configuration-file/).

    This key defines how CloudCannon shows Structure options to populate an Object or Array input. This can be using a Select-style search bar or a pop-up modal. Modals are useful when you have several value options for your Structure.

    Values can be one of the following: `select`, or `modal`.

    By default, this key is `select`.
  examples:
    - description: In this example, the `related_articles` Structure only has one option so a `select` searchbar is appropriate.

  description: |-
    This key defines which key within `values[*].value` CloudCannon should use to identify the Structure option. If CloudCannon cannot find this key in a Structure value, it will compare all other key names in the Structure value to find the correct one.

    By default, this key is `_type`.
  examples:
    - description: In this example, we have change the `id_key` from the default `_type` to `component` to match our existing configuration in the `content_blocks` Array input.

  description: |-
    This key toggles whether inputs that are not present in the Structure are visible in the [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-data-editor/). Hiding these inputs does not delete the data. You can see structured data keys from outside a Structure by opening a file in the [Source Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-source-editor/). This key has no effect if `remove_extra_inputs` is `true`.

    By default, this key is `false` (i.e, non-structure inputs are visible in the Data Editor).
  examples:
    - description: In this example, we don't want inputs outside of those listed in the Structure (e.g., old inputs from deprecated versions of this Structure) to appear in the Data Editor.

- name: remove_empty_inputs
  json_path: type.structure.remove_empty_inputs
  description: |-
    This key toggles whether CloudCannon will remove empty nested inputs from an Object or Array input that uses this Structure when you save the input configuration. CloudCannon consideres an input to be empty when its value is `null`, `' '`, or undefined.

    If this key is set to `true`, the `id_key` must be configured for this Structure, as removing inputs prevents CloudCannon from comparing Structure values. You can bring back empty inputs removed from an Object or Array input by re-adding the structure to the input.

    By default, this key is `false` (i.e, CloudCannon does not remove empty inputs).
  examples:
    - description: In this example, we want to delete any unnecessary nested inputs (i.e., input we choose not to provide a value for) from Object or Array inputs referenceing the `event_details` Structure.

    This key toggles whether inputs that are not present in the Structure are removed from the file before CloudCannon loads it in an editing interface. Saving the file will push this change to your Git repository.

  description: |-
    This key toggles whether CloudCannon should treat an entry in the `values` array as the default option for your Object or Array input. If multiple entries in the `values` array are set to `true`, CloudCannon will use the first entry.

    If CloudCannon cannot determine the type of an entry within the `values` array based on the `id_key` or matching inputs in the `values.value` array, it will fall back to the default entry.

    By default, this key is `false` (i.e., the entry is not the default option).
  examples:
    - description: In this example, we want the entry labelled `Employee` to be our default option for populating inputs configured with the `staff` Structure.

    By default, this key is `false` (i.e., Object and Array inputs using this Structure option are not tabbed).
  examples:
    - description: In this example, we want the `content` and `style` keys in our Structure to be tabs at the top of the Data Editor, with the `title` and `text`, and `color` and `font` keys nested within those tabs respectively.

    * `heading`
    * `inputs`

    By default, CloudCannon respects the order of inputs as configured in the `values.value` key and does not include any groups.
  examples:
    - description: 'In this example, we want to separate the inputs into two groups with descriptive headings: `title` and `subtitle` under the `Titles` heading, and `author` under the `Details` heading.'

    This key defines which inputs are available at a given level of the configuration cascade.

    The following nested keys are available for each input inside `_inputs`:

    * `type`
    * `label`
    * `comment`
    * `context`
    * `hidden`
    * `disabled`
    * `instance_value`
    * `cascade`
    * `options`

    This key has no default. If undefined at higher levels of the [configuration cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/), `_inputs` will default to any values configured in the [CloudCannon configuration file](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-cloudcannon-configuration-file/).
  examples:
    - description: In this example, we have configured the `date_created` Date input, which will automatically populate when you create a file using this input. Editors cannot alter this input as the interface is disabled.

    This key defines the dispaly name for a given value in a Structure. The name will appear in the *+ Add* button dropdown below an Object or Array input or in the Structures modal (if configured).

    By default, this key falls back to `unknown`.

    This key defines the appearance of a Card. You can configure Card preview for [Structures](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-structure/) and [Snippets](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-snippet/). This key is separate from the `preview` key and only affects the select and modal lists.

    The following nested keys are available:

    * `subtext`
    * `icon`
    * `icon_color`
    * `image`
    * `metadata`
    * `gallery`

    By default, CloudCannon uses the values configured for `preview`
