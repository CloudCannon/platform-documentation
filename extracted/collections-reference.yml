  description: |-
    This key defines the folder path for the collection key in which it is nested.

    The value for this key is relative to your [Site source](/documentation/articles/configuration-file-reference/#source). Each Collection must have a unique path.

    This key has no default.
  examples:
    - description: In this example, the files for the `blog` Collection are located in the `content/blog` folder.
      language: yaml
      code: |-
        collections_config:

      annotations: []
      source: cloudcannon.config.yml
- name: glob
  json_path: collections_config.*.glob
  description: |-
    This key defines globs which filter the files visible in the *Collection browser* for a given Collection. Values in this array are relative to the Collection [path](/documentation/articles/collections-reference/#path).

    Globs can be positive (e.g. `*.yml`), or negative (e.g. `!**/*.json`). Files are included in a Collection if they match any positive globs and do not match any negative globs. If you do not define any positive globs, CloudCannon will include all non-developer files in a Collection unless they match a negative
    glob.

    > For more information about developer files, please read our documentation on the [include\_developer\_files](/documentation/articles/collections-reference/#include_developer_files) key.

    Defining a negative glob for a Collection does not remove a file from the associated Collection folder in your Git repository. Similarly, defining a positive glob for a file in a folder outside your Collection path does not move the file.

    This key has no default.
  examples:
    - description: In this example, the *Collection browser* will show all files in the `data` folder except for the `secret.yml` file.
      language: yaml
      code: |-

      source: cloudcannon.config.yml
- name: url
  json_path: collections_config.*.url
  description: |-
    This key defines the output URL for files in a given Collection. CloudCannon uses the output URL in the [Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-visual-editor/), and on your [Testing Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-testing-domain/) and [Custom Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/).

      Values for this key can be a mix of plain text and template strings, and should begin and end with the `/` character. Template strings can contain data placholders and fixed placeholders, which CloudCannon will replace with the data it references when generating the output URL.

    > For more information about data placeholders and fixed placeholders, please read our documentation on [configuring your template strings](/documentation/articles/configure-your-template-strings/).

    By default, CloudCannon will use the key name of the Collection.
  examples:
    - description: In this example, the output URL for files in this Collection will be `/travel/` rather than the default `/blog/`.
      language: yaml
      code: |-
        collections_config:

  description: |-
    This key toggles whether CloudCannon will generate an output URL for a given Collection.

    Setting this key to `true` will prevent CloudCannon from generating an output URL for a Collection.

    By default, this key is `false` (i.e., generate an output URL for this Collection).
  examples:
    - description: In this example, `data` is an non-output Collection and we don't want output URLs generated.

- name: include_developer_files
  json_path: collections_config.*.include_developer_files
  description: |-
    This key toggles whether CloudCannon removes developer files from your *Collection browser*. CloudCannon excludes files that probably shouldn't be edited in a CMS from your *Collection browser*, for example files like `README.md` or `package.json`. CloudCannon excludes these files even if you have configured globs to allow them.

    Setting this key to `true` will allow CloudCannon to show developer files,
    assuming they are not filtered out by any configured
    [globs](/documentation/articles/collections-reference/#glob).

    By default, this key is `false` (i.e., do not include developer files).
  examples:
    - description: In this example, we want to see developer files in the *Collection browser* for the `data` Collection.
      language: yaml

- name: name
  json_path: collections_config.*.name
  description: |-
    This key defines the display name for a Collection. The name appears in the *Site Navigation* and at the top of the *Collection browser*. Changing the display name does not affect the Collection key name.

    By default, CloudCannon uses the Collection key name in title case (i.e., `blog_files` becomes "Blog Files").
  examples:
    - description: In this example, CloudCannon will call the `blog` Collection "Travel Blog" in the *Site Navigation* and the *Collection browser*.
      language: yaml
      code: |-
        collections_config:

- name: description
  json_path: collections_config.*.description
  description: |-
    This key defines the description text that appears on the *Collection browser* page. Collection descriptions are useful for adding extra context for your team members.

    CloudCannon supports a limited selection of Markdown formatting for the value of this key: links, bold, italic, subscript, superscript, and inline code.

    This key has no default.
  examples:
    - description: ''

    > For more information about the preview icon, please read our documentation on the [preview](/documentation/articles/configure-your-card-previews/) key.

    Values can be from [Google's Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Icons) library.

    By default, CloudCannon uses the Material Icon with the closest name to your Collection key name.

- name: sort
  json_path: collections_config.*.sort
  description: |-
    This key defines how CloudCannon sorts your Collection files when you first open your *Collection browser*. Configuring this key allows you to sort your Collection using a structured data key in your files.

    The following nested keys are available:

    * `key` (required)
    * `order`

    By default, CloudCannon sorts your Collection files alphabetically by filename in ascending order by default. However, if you have configured the [sort\_options](/documentation/articles/collections-reference/#sort_options) key, CloudCannon will use the first array item in `sort_options`.

    If you use the *Sort* dropdown in your *Collection browser* to order your Collection files, CloudCannon will preferentially use your most recent sorting method over the value configured in the `sort` key.
  examples:
    - description: In this example, CloudCannon will sort files in the `blog` Collection by the `date` key in the front matter of each file, in descending order.
      language: yaml
      code: |-
        collections_config:

- name: sort.key
  json_path: collections_config.*.sort.key
  description: |-
    This key defines which key CloudCannon should use to sort files in your *Collection browser*. You must define this key for the `sort` object to function.

    Value must be the name of a structured data key in your Collection files. If some files in your Collection do not have this data key, CloudCannon will sort those in ascending alphabetical order, after the file sorted by your data key in the *Collection browser*.

    This key has no default.
  examples:
    - description: In this example, CloudCannon will sort files in the `blog` Collection by the `date` key in the front matter of each file, in descending order.
      language: yaml

  json_path: collections_config.*.sort.order
  description: |-
    This key defines the order in which Collection files are sorted in your *Collection browser*. CloudCannon will sort files according to the value of `sort.key`.

    Values can be one of the following: `asc`, `ascending`, `desc`, or `descending`.

    By default, this key is `ascending`.
  examples:
    - description: In this example, CloudCannon will sort files in the `blog` Collection by the `date` key in the front matter of each file, in descending order.
      language: yaml

  description: |-
    This key defines the options for the *Sort* dropdown in a *Collection browser*. Configuring sort options for a Collection will remove CloudCannon's default sorting options from the *Sort* dropdown.

    The following nested keys are available for each entry in the `sort_options` array:

    * `key` (required)
    * `order`
    * `label`

    By default, CloudCannon provides sorting options for path, file size, file creation time, and last modified, in ascending and descending order. CloudCannon will also read data keys from your early Collection files and provide options to sort by those key values.
  examples:
    - description: In this example, the *Sort* dropdown in the `blog` *Collection browser* only contains options for sorting by `author` and `date` in ascending and descending order.
      language: yaml
      code: |-
        collections_config:
          blog:
            sort_options:

- name: sort_options.key
  json_path: collections_config.*.sort_options.[*].key
  description: |-
    This key defines which key an option in the *Sort* dropdown should use to sort files in your *Collection browser*. You must define this key for every entry in the `sort_options` array for the object to function.

    Value must be the name of a structured data key in your Collection files. If some files in your Collection do not have this data key, CloudCannon will sort those in ascending alphabetical order, after the file sorted by your data key in the *Collection browser*.

    This key has no default.
  examples:
    - description: In this example, the "Author (A-Z)" option in the *Sort* dropdown will use the `author` key to sort files in the `blog` *Collection browser*.
      language: yaml
      code: |-
        collections_config:
          blog:

      annotations: []
      source: cloudcannon.config.yml
- name: sort_options.order
  json_path: collections_config.*.sort_options.[*].order
  description: |-
    This key defines which order an option in the *Sort* dropdown should use to sort files in your *Collection browser*. CloudCannon will sort files according to the value of `sort_options.key` for each option in the *Sort* dropdown.

    Values can be one of the following: `asc`, `ascending`, `desc`, or `descending`.

    By default, this key is `ascending`.
  examples:
    - description: In this example, the "Author (A-Z)" option in the *Sort* dropdown will sort files in the `blog` *Collection browser* in ascending order.
      language: yaml
      code: |-

  json_path: collections_config.*.sort_options.[*].label
  description: |-
    This key defines the label used for a file sorting option in the *Sort* dropdown.

    This key has no default.
  examples:
    - description: In this example, the sorting method which uses the `author` key is called "Author (A-Z)" in the *Sort* dropdown.
      language: yaml

      annotations: []
      source: cloudcannon.config.yml
- name: singular_name
  json_path: collections_config.*.singular_name
  description: |-
    This key defines the singular noun for your Collection name. CloudCannon uses the singular noun in the *\+ Add* button in the top right of the *Collection browser* when you select the option to add a new file. This is useful if your Collection name is an irregular plural (e.g., "syllabi" or "syllabuses" to "syllabus").

    By default, CloudCannon removes the `s` character from regular plurals to create a singular noun (e.g., "posts" to "post").

    This key has no default.
  examples:
    - description: In this example, the *\+ Add* button option to add a Collection file will read "Add Team Member" rather that "Add Team".
      language: yaml
      code: |-

    Values can be one of the following: `visual`, `content`, or `data`.

    By default, CloudCannon will open the new file in an appropriate editing interface for that file type. If CloudCannon cannot determine an appropriate editing interface, it will show a warning.
  examples:
    - description: In this example, we want new draft blog files to open in the [Content Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-content-editor/).

  description: |-
    This key defines a path for files created using an option in the *\+ Add* button dropdown. This path overrides the path for the current Collection and subfolder open in the *Collection browser*. This key is useful if you need to specify a specific subfolder within a Collection.

    The value for this key is relative to your Collection [path](/documentation/articles/collections-reference/#path).

    By default, this key is the path for the current Collection and subfolder open in the *Collection browser*.
  examples:
    - description: In this example, we want team members in the `_posts` Collection to create new files in the`blog` subfolder of the `_drafts` Collection rather than the current *Collection browser* they have open. By configuring the `base_path` value to `/../_drafts/blog`, new files will be created in a different Collection subfolder (i.e., `_drafts`) when a team member selects this option from the *\+ Add* button dropdown.

    This key toggles whether team members can use the *+ Add* button in the top right of the *Collection browser* to add files to a Collection. This key does not affect your ability to add files using the *File browser*.

    Setting this key to *true* will prevent team members from adding new files through the *Collection browser*.

    By default, this key is `false` (i.e., team members can add to the Collection) for most SSGs. For Eleventy, Hugo, and Jekyll, this key defaults to `true` for the `data` Collection (all subfolders in the `data` folder are non-output Collections).

    If both `disable_add` and`disable_add_folder` are set to `true`, and you have not defined any other `add_options`, then the *\+ Add* button will not appear in the top right of the *Collection browser*.
