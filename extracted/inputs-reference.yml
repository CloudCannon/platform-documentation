    This key defines which inputs are available at a given level of the configuration cascade.

    The following nested keys are available for each input inside `_inputs`:

    * `type`
    * `label`
    * `comment`
    * `context`
    * `hidden`
    * `disabled`
    * `instance_value`
    * `cascade`
    * `options`

    This key has no default. If undefined at higher levels of the [configuration cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/), `_inputs` will default to any values configured in the [CloudCannon configuration file](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-cloudcannon-configuration-file/).

  description: |-
    This key changes the type of editing interface used for an Input. Each Input type has a different appearance and functionality, processes and accepts different types of values, and has different configuration options.

    Value can be one of the following: `auto`, `checkbox`, `switch`, `code`, `color`, `datetime`, `date`, `time`, `file`, `document`, `image`, `number`, `range`, `object`, `array`, `select`, `multiselect`, `choice`, `multichoice`, `text`, `textarea`, `email`, `html`, `markdown`, or `url`.

    If the type or value of an Input is misconfigured, CloudCannon will display an orange warning instead of an Input. If type is not configured for an Input, CloudCannon will attempt to determine Input type based on value or key name conventions.

    This key has no default.

- name: _inputs.*.options

  description: |-
    This key determines the configuration specific to each input type. If this key and nested keys are not defined, CloudCannon will use the default configuration options for that input type.

    This key has no default.

    For more information on options, please read our documentation on each input type.
  examples: []
- name: _inputs.*.hidden
  json_path: _inputs.*.hidden
  description: |-
    This key toggles the visibility of an input in the Data Editor or the sidebar of the Visual or Content Editor. Hidden inputs are useful when you want an input to exist, but not be visible or editable outside of the Source Editor.

    Value can be a boolean or a string. A boolean value of `true` will hide the input.

    A string value can hide an input based on the value of another input. You can reverse the value with a `!` character at the beginning.

    * `published` hides an input when the sibling input `published` is truthy
    * `!published` hides an input when the sibling input `published` is falsy

    For reverse values in `YAML` files, the string should be in `'` or `"` quotation marks.

    By default, this key follows the input naming convention where key names beginning with an underscore are hidden `true`.
  examples: []
- name: _inputs.*.disabled
  json_path: _inputs.*.disabled
  description: |-
    This key toggles whether the value of an input is editable in the Data Editor or the sidebar of the Visual or Content Editor. Disabled inputs are useful if you want CloudCannon to display the input value, but prevent team members from editing the value outside of the Source Editor.

    The value of this key can be a boolean or a string. A boolean value of `true` will prevent team members from editing the value.

    A string value can prevent team members from editing an input based on the value of another input. You can reverse the value with a `!` character at the beginning.

    * `published` hides an input when the sibling input `published` is truthy
    * `!published` hides an input when the sibling input `published` is falsy

    For reverse values in `YAML` files, the string should be in `'` or `"` quotation marks.

    By default, this key is `false` (i.e., team members can edit input values).
  examples:

  description: |-
    This key determines whether an input is automatically populated with a value when the input is created. This occurs when creating a new file, or adding array items containing this input.

    Valid values are `UUID` or `NOW`.

    * `UUID` generates a uuidv4 key (<a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/130298" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extremely unlikely to generate duplicates)</a>, useful for identifying unique items (e.g. `6ec0bd7f-11c0-43da-975e-2a8ad9ebae0b`)
    * `NOW` generates the current datetime in the Site's configured timezone

    This key has no default.
  examples: []
- name: _inputs.*.cascade
  json_path: _inputs.*.cascade
  description: |-
    This key determines whether CloudCannon should merge this input configuration with any matching, less specific configurations elsewhere in the configuration cascade.

    The [configuration cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/) works by finding the most specific `_inputs` entry. Usually, once an option is found in the cascade, there's no reason to keep looking. When this key is `true`, the cascade continues looking and each entry found is merged.

    This key allows you to define some options globally while using specific options for other keys at different levels of the cascade. For example, define a `comment` globally, but use collection-specific `label` for inputs in different collections. You can stop the cascade at any point in the configuration cascade by setting `cascade` to `false`.

    By default, this key is `true` (i.e., merges all configurations for an input in the cascade).
  examples: []
- name: _inputs.*.options.required
  json_path: _inputs.*.options.required
  description: |-
    This key toggles whether CloudCannon requires this Input to have a value. If set to `true`, CloudCannon will require you to enter a value to save your changes, or discard your unsaved changes.

    This key defines a [regular expression](https://re2js.leopard.in.ua/) that the Input value must match. When configured, CloudCannon will require you to enter a value that matches the REGEX pattern. If the Input already contains an invalid value, CloudCannon will require you to enter a valid string to save your changes, or discard your unsaved changes.

    Value must be a valid REGEX string. If your REGEX string includes a `\` character and CloudCannon Configuration File is a `.yml` file, use single quotes `'` around the string to avoid a build error.

    This key has no default.

    This key is available for Code, Color, File, Select, Text, Rich Text, and URL Inputs. To use this key in a Select Input, `allow_create` must be set to `true`.

    This key defines the earliest date and time, inclusive, that CloudCannon will allow in an Input. When configured, CloudCannon will prevent you from selecting an earlier date and time. If the Input already contains an earlier date and time, CloudCannon will require you to change it to a valid value to save your changes, or discard your unsaved changes.

    Value must be in [ISO8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) format. If `options.end_before` is also configured, this key cannot be a later date and time.
