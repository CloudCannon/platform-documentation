key_value_type:
  - Boolean
key_description: >-
  This key determines whether CloudCannon should merge this input configuration
  with any matching, less specific configurations elsewhere in the configuration
  cascade.


  The [configuration
  cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/) works by
  finding the most specific `_inputs` entry. Usually, once an option is found in
  the cascade, there's no reason to keep looking. When this key is `true`, the
  cascade continues looking and each entry found is merged.


  This key allows you to define some options globally while using specific
  options for other keys at different levels of the cascade. For example, define
  a `comment` globally, but use collection-specific `label` for inputs in
  different collections. You can stop the cascade at any point in the
  configuration cascade by setting `cascade` to `false`.


  By default, this key is `true` (i.e., merges all configurations for an input
  in the cascade).
