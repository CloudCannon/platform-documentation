key_description: >-
  This key defines the date and time, exclusive, that CloudCannon will allow in
  an Input. When configured, CloudCannon will prevent you from selecting a later
  date and time. If the Input already contains a later date and time,
  CloudCannon will require you to change it to a valid value to save your
  changes, or discard your unsaved changes.


  Value must be in <a
  href="https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">ISO8601</a> format. If `options.start_from` is also configured,
  this key cannot be an earlier date and time.


  This key has no default.


  This key is available for Date and Time Inputs.
