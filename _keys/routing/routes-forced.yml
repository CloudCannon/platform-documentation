  This key defines which URL should trigger this redirect rule. You must define
  this key for the redirect rule to function.


  Values can be a plain text string or REGEX (implemented by
  [re2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax)). URLs must always start with
  a `/` character. The REGEX functions `^` and `$` are implicit for each value
  of this key.


  This key has no default.

    In this example, we want to permanently redirect any users requesting the "/documentation/articles/choosing-your-ssg/" URL.
