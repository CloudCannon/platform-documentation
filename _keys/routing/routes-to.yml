  This key defines which URL this redirect rule should send visitors to. You
  must define this key for the redirect rule to function.


  Values can be a plain text string or REGEX (implemented by
  [re2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax)). URLs must always start with
  a `/` character. The REGEX functions `^` and `$` are implicit for each value
  of this key.


  This key has no default.


  <comp.Example>
    In this example, we want to permanently redirect any users requesting the "/documentation/articles/choosing-your-ssg/" URL to "/documentation/articles/select-your-ssg/".

    <comp.MultiCodeBlock language="JSON" source="routing.json">
    ``````````
    {
      "routes": [
        {
          "from": "/documentation/articles/choosing-your-ssg/",
          "to": "/documentation/articles/select-your-ssg/",
          "status": 308
        }
      ]
    }
