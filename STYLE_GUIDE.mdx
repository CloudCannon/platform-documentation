## 1. General Writing Rules

### 1.1 Voice and Tone

#### 1.1.1 Active Voice

Use active voice whenever possible. Active voice is clearer and more direct.

- ✅ **Good:** "CloudCannon syncs your files from your Git repository."
- ❌ **Avoid:** "Your files are synced by CloudCannon from your Git repository."

#### 1.1.2 Second Person ("You")

Address the reader directly using "you" and "your."

- ✅ **Good:** "You can configure your Collections at any time."
- ❌ **Avoid:** "Users can configure their Collections at any time."

#### 1.1.3 Conversational but Professional

Write as if you're explaining something to a colleague. Be friendly and approachable, but maintain professionalism.

- ✅ **Good:** "Let's walk through how to create your first Site."
- ❌ **Too casual:** "Alright, let's go create a Site real quick!"
- ❌ **Too formal:** "The user shall proceed to instantiate a Site entity."

#### 1.1.4 Present Tense (with exceptions)

Use present tense to describe how features work and what they do. Use future tense ("will") for outcomes immediately following user actions in instructions.

**Present Tense for General Descriptions:**
- ✅ **Good:** "Collections appear in the *Site Navigation* for easy access."
- ✅ **Good:** "CloudCannon automatically detects your Collections."
- ✅ **Good:** "These tools allow you to customize the order."
- ❌ **Avoid:** "Collections will appear in the *Site Navigation*."

**Future Tense for Immediate Outcomes in Instructions:**
- ✅ **Good:** "CloudCannon will open a new file in an editing interface." (immediately after you click)
- ✅ **Good:** "CloudCannon will commit your changes to your Git repository." (after you save)
- This signals to users what will happen next as a direct result of their action.

**Why Present Tense for Features?**
- Creates a sense of immediacy and confidence
- Describes current state and behavior, not hypothetical future
- Aligns with how users think ("What does this do?" not "What will this do?")
- More authoritative and direct

**Pattern to Follow:**
- **Explaining features:** Present tense
- **Describing UI behavior:** Present tense
- **Step outcomes in instructions:** Future tense ("will")
- **General capabilities:** Present tense

#### 1.1.5 Positive Language

Frame instructions positively. Tell readers what to do, not what to avoid (except in warnings).

- ✅ **Good:** "Enter your Site name in the text field."
- ❌ **Avoid:** "Don't leave the Site name field blank."

---

### 1.2 Grammar and Mechanics

#### 1.2.1 Punctuation

**Oxford Comma**
- Always use the Oxford comma (serial comma) in lists.
- ✅ **Good:** "You can add, edit, and delete files."
- ❌ **Avoid:** "You can add, edit and delete files."

**Periods in Lists**
- Use periods at the end of list items if they are complete sentences.
- Don't use periods if list items are fragments or single words.

**Hyphens and Dashes**
- Use hyphens (-) for compound modifiers: "CloudCannon-specific terms"
- Use em dashes (—) sparingly for emphasis or interruption (no spaces around them)
- Don't use double hyphens (--) in prose

**Contractions**
- Use common contractions (you'll, we'll, it's, don't) to maintain a conversational tone.
- Avoid contractions in error messages or warnings.

#### 1.2.2 Capitalization

**CloudCannon-Specific Terms**
- Capitalize CloudCannon concepts when referring to the specific CloudCannon feature or entity:
  - **Site** (the CloudCannon concept)
  - **Organization** (the CloudCannon concept)
  - **Collection** (the CloudCannon concept)
  - **Team Member** (a person in your CloudCannon Organization)
  - **Permission Group**
  - **Schema**
  - **Structure**
  - **Configuration File**
  - **Visual Editor**, **Content Editor**, **Data Editor**, **Source Editor**
  - **Collection Browser**, **File Browser**, **Sites Browser**, **Organizations Browser**
  - **Site Navigation**, **Site Header**, **App Sidebar**
  - **Git provider** (lowercase "provider")

- Use lowercase for general usage:
  - ✅ **Good:** "A Site is a website in CloudCannon."
  - ✅ **Good:** "Each site has its own configuration."
  - ✅ **Good:** "You can organize files into Collections."
  - ✅ **Good:** "A collection is a group of related files."

**UI Elements**
- Capitalize UI element names as they appear in the interface:
  - *+ Add* button
  - *Save* button
  - *Sort* dropdown
  - *View* menu
  - *Filter* text field
  - *Configuration Mode* toggle

**Headings**
- Use sentence case for headings (capitalize only the first word and proper nouns).
- ✅ **Good:** "Configure your first build"
- ❌ **Avoid:** "Configure Your First Build"

**File Names and Paths**
- Use lowercase for file extensions and paths.
- Use code formatting for file names: `cloudcannon.config.yml`

#### 1.2.3 Abbreviations and Acronyms

**First Use**
- Spell out abbreviations and acronyms on first use, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses.
- ✅ **Good:** "Single Sign-On (SSO) allows..."
- After first use, you may use the abbreviation alone.

**Common Exceptions**
- Don't spell out if the abbreviation is more common than the full term:
  - API (Application Programming Interface)
  - URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Git (not an abbreviation, but never written in all caps as GIT)

#### 1.2.4 Numbers

**Numerals vs. Words**
- Use numerals for: 10 and above, measurements, percentages, version numbers
- Spell out: One through nine (unless starting a list or in technical contexts)
- ✅ **Good:** "You have three options."
- ✅ **Good:** "The file is 50 MB."
- ✅ **Good:** "Select one of the 15 templates."

**Starting Sentences**
- Don't start sentences with numerals. Rewrite or spell out the number.
- ❌ **Avoid:** "15 templates are available."
- ✅ **Good:** "Fifteen templates are available." or "There are 15 templates available."

---

### 1.3 Terminology

#### 1.3.1 Product Names

**CloudCannon**
- Always capitalize as "CloudCannon" (not "Cloud Cannon" or "cloudcannon").
- Don't abbreviate.

**Static Site Generators**
- Use the official capitalization for SSG names:
  - Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy (not "11ty" in prose), Astro, Next.js, Gatsby, SvelteKit, Nuxt

**Git Providers**
- Use official capitalization:
  - GitHub (not "Github")
  - GitLab (not "Gitlab")
  - Bitbucket

**Other Products**
- Bookshop, Rosey, Deno
- Visual Studio Code (or VS Code)

#### 1.3.2 Consistent Terms

Use consistent terminology throughout documentation. Refer to the same thing with the same words.

**Preferred Terms:**
| Use This | Not This |
|----------|----------|
| Git repository | repo, git repo, repository (when Git context is clear) |
| Git provider | source provider, git host |
| Site files | source files (unless specifically referring to source code) |
| Configuration File | config file, configuration |
| front matter | frontmatter, Front Matter |
| webpage | web page |
| website | web site, site (when ambiguous with CloudCannon Site) |
| email | e-mail |
| sign in / log in | login (as a verb) |
| dropdown | drop-down, drop down |
| checkbox | check box |
| filename | file name |

**Avoid Jargon**
- When technical terms are necessary, explain them.
- Link to the glossary for CloudCannon-specific terms on first use in an article.

---

### 1.4 Formatting

#### 1.4.1 Italics

**Use Italics For:**
1. UI elements (buttons, menus, text fields, toggles, tabs, pages, dropdowns, etc.)
2. Configuration field names in external services (e.g., *AllowedOrigins* in Azure)

**UI Elements in All Documentation:**
- Italicize all UI element names using asterisks in Markdown/MDX.
- ✅ **Good:** "Click the *Save* button."
- ✅ **Good:** "Open the *Site Navigation*."
- ✅ **Good:** "Use the *+ Add* dropdown to create a new file."
- ❌ **Avoid:** "Click the Save button."

**External Configuration Fields:**
- Italicize field names from external services (Azure, AWS, etc.)
- ✅ **Good:** "*AllowedOrigins* must include `https://app.cloudcannon.com`"
- This distinguishes required field names from other text

**Don't Use Italics For:**
- Emphasis (use bold or Notice components instead)
  - Italics are reserved exclusively for UI elements and technical field names
- Code, file names, or paths (use inline code formatting instead)
- CloudCannon concept names (Site, Organization, Collection)
- Generic emphasis words (must, always, never) - use plain text

#### 1.4.2 Bold

**Use Bold For:**
1. Headings in Notice components (using `<strong>` tags)
2. Term names in bulleted definition lists (not inline)

**Headings in Notice Components:**

Use bold for headings, labels, or important callouts within Notice components.

✅ **Good (using markdown bold):**
```mdx
<comp.Notice info_type="pricing">
  **This feature is available on our [Enterprise plan](/pricing/).**

  Want to chat about whether this feature is right for you?
</comp.Notice>
```

**Term Names in Bulleted Definition Lists:**
- ✅ **Good:**
```markdown
* **User** — The team member who wants to access CloudCannon.
* **Identity Provider** — The cloud software that will authenticate the user's identity.
* **Service Provider** — The cloud application a user wants to log in to (i.e., CloudCannon).
```
- Use bold for the term being defined, followed by an em dash (—) and the definition
- This format is for lists of multiple related terms, not inline definitions

**Inline Definitions (Don't Use Bold):**
- ❌ **Avoid:** "A **Schema** is a preconfigured file template."
- ✅ **Good:** "A Schema is a preconfigured file template."
- Don't bold terms in inline definitions within sentences or paragraphs

**Don't Use Bold For:**
- UI elements (always use *italics* instead, even for external services)
  - Older documentation may use bold - should be updated to italics)
- Inline term definitions
- Emphasis (use Notice components instead)
- Button names or menu options

#### 1.4.3 Code Formatting

**Inline Code**
- Use backticks for:
  - File names: `cloudcannon.config.yml`
  - Paths: `/documentation/user-articles/`
  - Configuration keys: `collections_config`
  - Code values: `true`, `false`, `null`
  - HTML elements: `<div>`, `<img>`
  - CSS classes: `.c-docs-image`
  - Command-line commands: `deno task serve`

**Code Blocks**
- Use fenced code blocks with language specification.
- For configuration examples, use the `MultiCodeBlock` component with YAML/JSON translation.

```yaml
# Example configuration
collections_config:
  blog:
    path: content/posts
```

**Annotations in Code**
- Use numbered annotations (e.g., `___1___`, `___2___`) to mark code that needs explanation.
- Follow with `<comp.Annotation number="1">` components to explain each marker.

#### 1.4.4 Links

**Internal Links**
- Use absolute paths starting with `/documentation/`:
  - `/documentation/user-articles/` for user-focused articles
  - `/documentation/developer-articles/` for developer-focused articles
  - `/documentation/guides/` for guide series

**Link Text**
- Use descriptive link text. Don't use "click here" or "read more."
- ✅ **Good:** "For more information, read our documentation on [Collections](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-collection/)."
- ❌ **Avoid:** "For more information, click [here](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-collection/)."

**External Links**
- Use full URLs for external links.
- Add `target="_blank" rel="noopener"` for external links in HTML.

**Cross-Referencing**
- Link to related articles at the end of articles.
- Link to glossary terms on first use in articles.
- In glossary terms, don't use asterisks or special formatting for cross-references—just plain text.

### 1.5 Components

CloudCannon documentation uses custom components for enhanced formatting. Use these components consistently.

#### 1.5.1 Notice Component

Use for tips, information, warnings, and important notes.

```mdx
<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  This is an informational note.
</comp.Notice>
```

**Info Types:**
- `info` - General information or tips
- `important` - Important information that affects functionality
- `warning` - Cautions about potential problems

**Guidelines:**
- Place notices close to the relevant content.
- Keep notice text concise.
- Use proper HTML paragraph tags inside notices if needed: `<p>...</p>`

#### 1.5.2 DocShot Component

Use for UI screenshots and snippets.

```mdx
<comp.DocShot 
  docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard" 
  alt="A screenshot of the Site Dashboard shows the Getting Started guide." 
  title="The Site Dashboard" 
  type="screenshot"/>
```

**Types:**
- `screenshot` - Full interface screenshots
- `ui-snippet` - Closeup of specific UI elements

**Alt Text:**
- Always include descriptive alt text.
- Describe what's visible in the image and its context.

#### 1.5.3 MultiCodeBlock Component

Use for configuration examples that should be translatable between YAML and JSON.

```mdx
<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````
collections_config:
  blog:
    path: content/posts
``````````
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>
```

#### 1.5.4 DocsImage Component

Use for inline images that don't need the DocShot workflow.

```mdx
<comp.DocsImage 
  path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/path/to/image.png" 
  alt="Description of image" 
  title="Image Title" 
  type="screenshot"/>
```

---

### 1.6 Accessibility

**Write for Global Audiences**
- Use simple, clear language.
- Avoid idioms and cultural references.
- Use standard international date format (YYYY-MM-DD) or spell out dates (January 8, 2026).

**Screen Reader Considerations**
- Provide descriptive alt text for all images.
- Use proper heading hierarchy (don't skip levels).
- Don't rely solely on color or position to convey information.

**Inclusive Language**
- Use gender-neutral language.
- ✅ **Good:** "The user can configure their settings."
- ❌ **Avoid:** "The user can configure his settings."
- Use "they/their" as singular pronouns when needed.

- Use lowercase and hyphens

#### 2.1.2 Front Matter
```yaml
---
_schema: default
title: Descriptive Title of the Release
---
```

- Title should be descriptive, not just a date
- Title should be sentence case
- Use feature names as they appear in CloudCannon

nav_title: What is a [Concept]?
published: true
image: [URL to thumbnail]
description: Learn about [Concept] in CloudCannon.
article_category:
  - Explanation
article_topic:
  - [Relevant Topic]
tags: []
related_articles: []
related_links: []
---
```

#### 2.2.3 Title Pattern
- Always start with "What is" or "What are"
- Use "a" or "an" for singular concepts
- Use "are" for plural concepts
- Examples:
  - "What is a Collection?"

4. **Related Information** (final paragraph or section)
   - Link to configuration documentation
   - Link to instructional articles
   - Link to related concepts

#### 2.2.5 Writing Style

**Start with the Definition**
- ✅ **Good:** "A Collection is a group of related files with a similar format."
- ❌ **Avoid:** "When you're working in CloudCannon, you might wonder what Collections are."

**Use Examples**
- Include concrete examples: "(e.g., a folder of pages, blog posts, or data files)"

**Show, Don't Just Tell**
- Include screenshots for visual concepts
- Use code examples for technical concepts

**Link to Practical Actions**
- End with next steps: "For more information, please read our documentation on [configuring your Collections]."

---

- Example: "## Create a new file in the collection browser" and "## Upload from the File Browser"

**Conditionals**
- Use "if/then" structure for conditional steps
- ✅ **Good:** "If you have a DAM connected to your site, CloudCannon will prompt you to select a location."

---

### 2.4 Guides

Guides are multi-page tutorials that walk users through a complete task or workflow.

#### 2.4.1 File Structure
- Each guide is a folder containing multiple MDX files
- Include an `index.mdx` as the introduction
- Include a `_data.yml` file with guide metadata
- Name files descriptively: `create-a-site.mdx`, `configure-collections.mdx`

#### 2.4.2 Front Matter for index.mdx
```yaml
---
_schema: default
_uuid: [generated]
_created_at: [generated]
title: Introduction
nav_title: Introduction
order: 1
published: true
image: [guide thumbnail URL]
description: >-
  Brief description of what the guide will teach.

- **Industry acronyms:** DAM, SSG, API, CDN, DNS, HTTP, CORS, XSS, SSO, SAML
- **External services:** Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, AWS, Azure, Make, Zapier, Okta
- **File formats:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, YAML, JSON, Markdown, MDX
- **Generic web terms:** browser (web browser), domain (general concept), email, URL

**Possessive Forms:**
- Include apostrophe-s inside the italics: *Site's*, *Organization's*, *Collection's*
- ✅ **Good:** "A *Site's* configuration is stored in..."
- ❌ **Avoid:** "*Site*'s configuration is stored in..."

**No Bold or Emphasis**
- Don't bold the term being defined in the definition
- Keep formatting minimal and consistent

**Code Formatting**
- Use backticks for file names, configuration keys, and code values
- Example: "...in your `cloudcannon.config.yml` file."

#### 2.5.6 Cross-Referencing Other Terms

**Asterisks ONLY for UI Elements**
- Only use asterisks for UI elements, NOT for concept cross-references
- ✅ **Good:** "Collections appear in the *Site Navigation*."
- ✅ **Good:** "Each Team Member belongs to at least one Permission Group."
- ❌ **Avoid:** "Each *Team Member* belongs to at least one *Permission Group*."
- ❌ **Avoid:** "A *Collection* is a group of files in a *Site*."

**Mention Related Terms Naturally**
- Reference related glossary terms using plain text
- This helps users discover connections between concepts
- Example: "Team members help you edit and review content, maintain Sites, and manage your Organization."

#### 2.5.7 Documentation Links

**Path Format**
- Always use hyphenated format (NO `/documentation/` prefix in glossary links):
  - `/user-articles/[slug]/`
  - `/developer-articles/[slug]/`
- ✅ **Good:** `/user-articles/what-is-a-collection/`
- ❌ **Wrong:** `/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-collection/`
- ❌ **Wrong:** `/user/articles/what-is-a-collection/`

**Link Requirements**
- Link to the most relevant article when available
- Prefer explanation articles ("What is...") over instruction articles
- Leave empty for terms that don't require CloudCannon-specific documentation

**When to Leave Empty:**
- Generic file formats (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, YAML, JSON, etc.)
- External services and standards (GitHub, GitLab, AWS, Azure, API, HTTP, DNS)
- Static Site Generators (Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy, etc.) - unless CloudCannon has SSG-specific docs
- DAM providers (AWS S3, Azure Blob, Cloudflare R2)
- Subscription plans
- Generic technical terms (CORS, XSS, MIME)
- Self-explanatory UI elements (Avatar, Screenshot)

**Examples:**

✅ **Good Links:**
```yaml
documentation_link: /user-articles/what-is-a-collection/
documentation_link: /developer-articles/configure-your-collections/
documentation_link: /developer-guides/okta-sso-saml/
```

✅ **Acceptable Empty:**
```yaml
documentation_link:  # File format, no CloudCannon-specific article needed
```

❌ **Avoid Linking To:**
- Changelogs: `/new_changelogs/...`
- Generic tour links
- Incorrect path formats

#### 2.5.8 Abbreviations

**Format for Abbreviations**
```yaml
glossary_term_name: [Abbreviation]
term_description: >-
  An abbreviation of [Full Term]. [Abbreviation] is [definition and context].
documentation_link: [link or empty]
```

**Example:**
```yaml
_schema: default
glossary_term_name: SSO
term_description: >-
  An abbreviation of Single Sign-On. SSO allows users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple systems without re-entering credentials.
documentation_link: /user-articles/what-is-sso/
```

#### 2.5.9 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Too Brief:**
```yaml
term_description: A file in CloudCannon.
```

❌ **Too Long (should be in an article):**
```yaml
term_description: >-
  A Collection is a group of related files. To create a Collection, first open your configuration file, then add a collections_config key, then add your collection name, then configure the path, and then save your changes. CloudCannon will then display your Collection in the Site Navigation... [continues for 50+ more words]
```

❌ **Using "this" or "these":**
```yaml
term_description: >-
  This is where you organize your files.
```

❌ **Wrong documentation link format:**
```yaml
documentation_link: /user/articles/what-is-a-collection/
documentation_link: /documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-collection/
documentation_link: /new_changelogs/2022/08-10_some-feature/
```

❌ **Inconsistent italicization:**
```yaml
term_description: >-
  A *Collection* is a group of files in a *Site*.  # Don't italicize concepts
```

✅ **Good Examples:**

**Simple Term (2 sentences):**
```yaml
_schema: default
glossary_term_name: Collection
term_description: >-
  A group of related files with a similar format (e.g., a folder of pages, blog posts, or data files). Once you group your files into *Collections*, they appear in the *Site Navigation* for easy access.
documentation_link: /user-articles/what-is-a-collection/
```

**Complex Term (3 sentences):**
```yaml
_schema: default
glossary_term_name: Team Member
term_description: >-
  A person in the same CloudCannon Organization as you. Team members help you edit and review content, maintain Sites, and manage your Organization. Each team member has their own CloudCannon account and an individual history of all the changes they have made.
documentation_link: /user-articles/what-is-a-team-member/
```

**Abbreviation:**
```yaml
_schema: default
glossary_term_name: DAM
term_description: >-
  An abbreviation of Digital Asset Management. A DAM is a system for storing, organizing, and retrieving media files like images and videos.
documentation_link: /user-articles/introduction-to-assets-and-dams/
```

**Generic Term (no link):**
```yaml
_schema: default
glossary_term_name: YAML
term_description: >-
  A human-readable data serialization format commonly used for configuration files.
documentation_link:
```

#### 2.5.10 Quality Metrics and Best Practices

Based on comprehensive glossary reviews, aim for these quality benchmarks:

**Target Metrics:**
- **Description Length:** 80%+ of entries should be 2-3 sentences
- **Documentation Links:** 64%+ with links (remaining are intentionally empty for generic terms)
- **Path Format Consistency:** 100% using standardized formats
- **Typos:** 0
- **Alphabetical Organization:** 100% correct

**Regular Maintenance:**
- **Quarterly Review:** Check for new features requiring glossary entries
- **Link Validation:** Ensure documentation links remain valid
- **Consistency Audit:** Verify formatting rules are followed for new entries
- **Term Disambiguation:** Watch for overlapping or confusing terms

**When Adding New Terms:**
1. Check if the term is already defined under a different name
2. Verify alphabetical placement
3. Follow the 2-3 sentence structure
4. Apply italicization rules consistently
5. Use appropriate documentation link format or leave empty
6. Cross-reference related terms naturally in plain text
