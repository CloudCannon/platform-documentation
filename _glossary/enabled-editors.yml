  This key defines which editing interfaces are available by default for files
  in your Site. Whether an editing interface is available for a specific file is
  determined by other factors.


  Values can be one of the following: `visual`, `content`, or `data`. Specifying
  one or more editing interfaces will disable all unspecified editing
  interfaces. You cannot disable the Source Editor with this key.


  By default, this key is set to `visual`, `content`, and `data`.


  For more information, please read our documentation on the [Visual
  Editor](/documentation/articles/the-visual-editor/), [Content
  Editor](/documentation/articles/the-content-editor/), [Data
  Editor](/documentation/articles/the-data-editor/), and [Source
  Editor](/documentation/articles/the-source-editor/).
