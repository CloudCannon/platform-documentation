<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Building is an optional step. If your Site is dynamic, or you only want to use CloudCannon as a CMS for your Git repository, you don’t need to build. For more information, please read our guide on using [CloudCannon in Headless Mode](/documentation/guides/headless-starter-guide/).
</comp.Notice>

A "build" is when CloudCannon converts all your Site files into a single, functional website. Building your Site in CloudCannon enables you to check all your files function well together, preview screenshots of your pages in the [Collection](https://alive-camel.cloudvent.net/documentation/articles/define-your-collections/) browser, view your Site live on a [Testing](https://alive-camel.cloudvent.net/documentation/articles/viewing-your-site-on-a-testing-domain/) and [Custom Domain](https://alive-camel.cloudvent.net/documentation/articles/hosting-your-site-on-a-custom-domain/), and use the [Visual Editor](https://alive-camel.cloudvent.net/documentation/articles/the-visual-editor/) for an intuitive editing experience.

When you are ready to set up builds, click the *Return to setup* button in the *Site Navigation*. This will take you back to the *Summary* tab on the *Status* page.

Click the *Open build configuration* button to open the *Build configuration* page in your *Site Settings.*

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Clicking the *I don't want to build* button will opt you out of building and into Headless Mode. You can turn off Headless Mode at any time on the *Details* page under your *Site Settings*. For more information, please read our guide on using [CloudCannon in Headless Mode](/documentation/guides/headless-starter-guide/).

To configure your first Site build you must provide the command line options and environment variables required by your Site. Specifically, CloudCannon needs your *Install Command*, *Build Command*, and *Output Path*.

CloudCannon will suggest build commands for you based on your SSG and the contents of your files. You can click on CloudCannon's suggested values to use them in your configuration.

When you are happy with your build commands, click the *Update Configuration and Build* button.

CloudCannon will attempt to build your Site.

You can monitor the outcome of your first build on the *Summary* tab of the *Status* page.

After a successful first build, CloudCannon will build your Site every time it syncs an update from your repository, or when you [choose to trigger a build](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-site-build/#starting-a-build). This ensures your most recent content is always live.

If your build fails for any reason, CloudCannon will suggest common solutions to troubleshoot your build on the *Summary* tab of the *Status* page.

### Building your site

&nbsp;

As a bonus, CloudCannon also provides hosting. You can now access the live preview version of your site (not indexed by search engines) by clicking on the *Live site preview* button in the top left of the app. This will take you to your unique *.cloudvent.net* address.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Your new adjective-noun.cloudvent.net site will give you a preview after every change. Share this URL to show off your new site before your changes go live!
</comp.Notice>

If your site fails to build, you will have some debugging work to do. Read the build output or check the Status page to see the suggested fixes for your site. Double-check your build settings and try again.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  If the site returned a 404 on the index, you might have set the wrong output path. This can indicate that no files were present in the configured folder.
</comp.Notice>

You may need to run extra commands before or after your build to get your site in the right state. For example, you may need to install npm packages for your site.

On CloudCannon, you can run extra commands at different points of the build using a build hook. For more information, see <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/extending-your-build-process-with-hooks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the build hook documentation</a>.

If you can’t figure out why your site failed to build, don’t hesitate to <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get in touch with our support team</a>. We’re always here to help.
