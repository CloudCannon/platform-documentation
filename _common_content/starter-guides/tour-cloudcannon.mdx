  Once you have created your CloudCannon configuration file, CloudCannon will return you to the *Summary* tab of the *Status* page.

  This page will prompt you to set up your *Build configuration*, but don't worry about that for now. Building is an optional part of setting up your Site. We'll cover build configuration in later in this guide.

  For now, let's take a tour of CloudCannon!
</comp.Slot>

In this guide we'll look at <a href="https://jovial-pipe.cloudvent.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sendit</a>, a website template hosted through CloudCannon, but feel free to follow along with your own Site and content.

## Site Navigation

<comp.Slot name="Site-Navigation-tour">
  Your *Site Navigation* is the gray sidebar on the left of the app, next to your *App* *Navigation*. The *Site Navigation* sidebar contains information and tools you will use often.

  Your *Site Navigation* contains:

  * **Projects dropdown** — If your Site is part of a [Project](/documentation/articles/create-a-project/), the *Projects dropdown* shows you which Project your Site belongs to and which Sites (if any) it publishes to.
  * **Site icon, Site name, and branch name** — These are your basic Site details, so you know which Site you are editing.
  * Avatar? —
  * **The Save button** —
  * **The Publish button** —
  * **The Live site preview button** —
  * **Site Dashboard** —
  * **Collections** —
  * **Developer Tools** —

### Dashboard

The CloudCannon dashboard gives you an overview of your Site.

Here, you can see your live URL (either the [test domain](/documentation/articles/viewing-your-site-on-a-testing-domain/) or a [custom domain](/documentation/articles/hosting-your-site-on-a-custom-domain/)), view recent activity on your Site, and scroll through your Collections in the *Site Navigation*. If you have completed a build through CloudCannon, your dashboard will also show you a preview of your homepage.

The *Activity* tab shows more paginated Site activity in reverse chronological order.

The *Usage* tab shows your current bandwidth and build time utilization. If your plan has limited build time, you can use this tab to monitor your usage allowance.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/CloudCannon-Getting-Started-Usage-View.png" alt="A screenshot of the Usage tab in the CloudCannon app shows a bandwidth utilization graph for each day this month." title="Usage tab" type="screenshot"/>

### Collections

Your collections are listed in your *Site Navigation*. <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/define-your-collections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Collections</a> are groups of related content. CloudCannon will automatically detect your collections when you create your Site. You can also configure your collections to customize your team's user experience.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/CloudCannon-Getting-Started-Collections-View.png" alt="A screenshot of the Collections view in the CloudCannon app shows a preview of all the pages tagged as blog posts on the example website." title="Collections view" type="screenshot"/>

Each collection corresponds to a folder in your site files. Navigating to a collection shows a preview of each file and lets your team members see all the content at a glance.

<comp.Slot name="SSG_Pages_Data_Paragraphs"></comp.Slot>

### Developer Tools

All your team members can access the *Dashboard* and *Collections* views. Developer tools are only visible to team members with specific permissions.

* **Status** — Shows the current status of your Git sync, previous syncs, and build output.
* **Files** — Opens a browser containing all the source files on the site.
* **Settings** — Allows you to configure your build settings, hosting, sharing, and other site settings.

We will discuss permissions and Permission Groups more in the Collaboration section of this guide.

## Editing interfaces

We’ll go deeper into how to configure the CloudCannon editing interfaces later in this guide. For now, here’s an overview of each one.

### Visual Editor

[The Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/the-visual-editor/) is the most intuitive way to edit content on CloudCannon, with editable elements indicated on a preview of your site. Your content team can click on any editable element to change its content and see those changes as they would appear live.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/CloudCannon-Getting-Started-Visual-Editor-Popup.png" alt="A screenshot of the Visual Editor in the CloudCannon app shows a pop-up for editing content in a live preview of the home page." title="Visual editor pop-up" type="screenshot"/>

The Visual Editor also features a sidebar for managing front matter content. You can customize these inputs to give your editing team a more intuitive interface. For example, add a date input for a date field, including a small comment to indicate how a field should be used, or use a select box to reference other pages on the site or data in a data file.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/CloudCannon-Getting-Started-Visual-Editor-Sidebar.png" alt="A screenshot of the Visual Editor in the CloudCannon app shows a sidebar for editing front matter content for the home page." title="Visual editor sidebar" type="screenshot"/>

CloudCannon requires you to build your Site to use the Visual Editor. We'll cover how to build your Site later in this guide.

### Content Editor

[The Content Editor](/documentation/articles/the-content-editor/) is a rich text editor for markup files. This editor is useful if you want a distraction-free, clean writing interface, particularly for blog posts and other content with a simple layout. You can configure the WYSIWYG toolbar for your Content Editor to ensure you have all the tools you need and edit structured data in the front matter of your markup files using the sidebar.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/editing/editing-interfaces/2024-04/CloudCannon-Documentation-Content-Editor-Blog.png" alt="A screenshot of the Content Editor shows a WYSIWYG editor for the copy of a blog post and a sidebar for editing front matter content." title="The Content Editor" type="screenshot"/>

<comp.Slot name="SSG_Snippets_Paragraph"></comp.Slot>

### Data Editor

We have already seen the [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/the-data-editor/) — the sidebar for managing front matter in the Visual and Content Editor. The Data Editor also manages content in YAML, TOML, JSON, CSV, and TSV files. The Data Editor uses inputs to provide an editing interface for structure data in your files.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/editing/editing-interfaces/2024-04/CloudCannon-Documentation-Data-Editor-Home-Page.png" alt="A screenshot of the Data Editor shows editable fields for a data file." title="The Data Editor" type="screenshot"/>

### Source Editor

[The Source Editor](/documentation/articles/the-source-editor/) is an in-browser code editor, great for making small, quick changes. As with all the editing interfaces, any changes sync back to your Git repository.
