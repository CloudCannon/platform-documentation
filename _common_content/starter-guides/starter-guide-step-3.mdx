Once syncing is complete, CloudCannon will open the *Status* page of your Site.

The *Status* page will be your home during Site set-up, informing you of your next steps. Even after set-up is complete, the *Status* page will alert you if there are any errors in your Site configuration and make suggestions about how to improve your experience.

The next step for Site set-up is to create your CloudCannon configuration file. Your configuration file is the heart of your CloudCannon experience.

For now, you only need to select your Static Site Generator (SSG) and define your collections.

A collection is a group of related files with a similar format (e.g., a folder of pages, blog posts, or data files). In CloudCannon, your collections appear in the *App Navigation*. You can configure the name, icon, and headings for the collections in the *App Navigation* using your CloudCannon configuration file.

Click on the *Generate a configuration file* button to create your CloudCannon configuration file.
