Once syncing is complete, CloudCannon will open the *Status* page of your Site.

The *Status* page will be your home during Site set-up, informing you of your next steps. Even after set-up is complete, the *Status* page will alert you if there are any errors in your Site configuration and make suggestions about how to improve your experience.

The next step for Site set-up is to create your CloudCannon configuration file. Your configuration file is the heart of your CloudCannon experience.

&nbsp;

For now, you only need to select your SSG and define your collections.

Click on the *Generate a configuration file* button to create your CloudCannon configuration file.
