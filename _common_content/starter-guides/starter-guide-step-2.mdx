Let's take a look at a site hosted through CloudCannon: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://jovial-pipe.cloudvent.net/">Sendit</a>!

Our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/templates/sendit/">Sendit template</a> is an open-source site for multiple SSGs, available through GitHub. You can see a list of our available templates by selecting 'Edit with a template' when you launch a new site. For now, we'll use Sendit to show you around the CloudCannon app, but feel free to explore the site as we go.

## Site navigation

### Dashboard

The CloudCannon dashboard gives you an overview of your site. Here, you can preview your home page, your live URL, and view recent activity site-wide with a list of git commits.

The *Activity* tab shows more paginated site activity in reverse chronological order.

The *Usage* tab shows your current bandwidth and build time utilization. If your plan has limited build time, you can use this tab to monitor your usage allowance.

### Collections

Your collections are listed in the sidebar. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/define-your-collections/">Collections</a> are groups of related content.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/CloudCannon-Getting-Started-Collections-View.png" alt="A screenshot of the Collections view in the CloudCannon app shows a preview of all the pages tagged as blog posts on the example website." title="Collections view" type="screenshot"/>

Each collection corresponds to a folder in your site files. Navigating to a collection shows a preview of each file and lets your team members see all the content at a glance.

### Developer Tools

All your team members can access the *Dashboard*&nbsp;and *Collections* views. Developer tools are only visible to team members with specific permissions.

* **Status** — Shows the current status of your Git sync, previous syncs, and build output.
* **Files** — Opens a browser containing all the source files on the site.
* **Settings** — Allows you to configure your build settings, hosting, sharing, and other site settings.

We will discuss permission levels more in the Collaboration section of this guide.

## Editing interfaces

We’ll go deeper into how to configure the CloudCannon editors later in this guide. For now, here’s an overview of each one.

### Visual Editor

[The Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/the-visual-editor/) is the most intuitive way to edit content on CloudCannon, with editable elements indicated on a preview of your site. Your content team can click on any editable element to change its content and see those changes as they would appear live.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/CloudCannon-Getting-Started-Visual-Editor-Popup.png" alt="A screenshot of the Visual Editor in the CloudCannon app shows a pop-up for editing content in a live preview of the home page." title="Visual editor pop-up" type="screenshot"/>

The Visual Editor also features a sidebar for managing front matter content. You can customize these inputs to give your editing team a more intuitive interface. For example, add a date picker for a date field, including a small comment to indicate how a field should be used, or use a select box to reference other pages on the site or data in a data file.

### Content Editor

[The Content Editor](/documentation/articles/the-content-editor/) is a rich text editor for Markdown files. This editor is useful if you want a distraction-free, clean writing interface, particularly for blog posts and other content with a simple layout. The Content Editor view also shows the Data Editor in the left-hand panel, as pictured below.

### Data Editor

We have already seen the [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/the-data-editor/) — the sidebar for managing front matter in the Visual and Content Editor. The Data Editor also manages content in YAML, TOML, JSON, CSV, and TSV files.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/CloudCannon-Getting-Started-Data-Editor.png" alt="A screenshot of the Data Editor in the CloudCannon app shows editable fields for a data file." title="Data editor" type="screenshot"/>

### Source Editor

[The Source Editor](/documentation/articles/the-source-editor/) is an in-browser code editor, great for making small, quick changes. As with all the Editors, any changes sync back to your Git repository.
