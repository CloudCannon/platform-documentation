Let's take a look at a site hosted through CloudCannon: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://jovial-pipe.cloudvent.net/">Sendit</a>!

Our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/templates/sendit/">Sendit template</a>&nbsp;is an open-source site for multiple SSGs, available through GitHub. You can see a list of our available templates by selecting 'Edit with a template' when you launch a new site. For now, we'll use Sendit to show you around the CloudCannon app, but feel free to explore the site as we go.

## Site navigation

### Dashboard

The CloudCannon dashboard gives you an overview of your site. Here, you can preview your home page, your live URL, and view recent activity site-wide with a list of git commits.

![The Dashboard view in the CloudCannon app shows a preview of your home page, live URL, and recent commits.](https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/CloudCannon-Getting-Started-Dashboard-View.png "Dashboard view")

The Activity tab shows more paginated site activity in reverse chronological order.

The Usage tab shows your current bandwidth and build time utilization. If your plan has limited build time, you can use this tab to monitor your usage allowance.

### Pages

The Pages view lists the pages on your site. Clicking on a page will open it in an editing interface.

![The Pages view in the CloudCannon app shows a preview of all the pages on the example website.](https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/CloudCannon-Getting-Started-Pages-View.png "Pages view")

### Collections

Your collections are listed in the sidebar. [Collections](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/defining-your-collections/) are groups of related pages.

In this example site, the blog collection is defined by a ‘posts’ tag in the front matter of each page.

![The Collections view in the CloudCannon app shows a preview of all the pages tagged as blog posts on the example website.](https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/CloudCannon-Getting-Started-Collections-View.png "Collections view")

Each collection corresponds to a folder in your site files. Navigating to a collection shows a preview of each file and lets your team members see all the content at a glance.

### Data

The Data tab shows all your data files. Clicking on a page will open it in an editing interface.

![The Data view in the CloudCannon app shows a list of data files for the example website.](https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/CloudCannon-Getting-Started-Data-View.png "Data view")

### Developer Tools

All your team members can access the Dashboard, Pages, Collections, and Data views. Developer tools are only visible to team members with specific permissions.

* **Status** — Shows the current status of your Git sync, previous syncs, and build output.
* **Files** — Opens a browser containing all the source files on the site.
* **Settings** — Allows you to configure your build settings, hosting, sharing, and other site settings.

We will discuss permission levels more in the Collaboration section of this guide.

## Editing interfaces

We’ll go deeper into how to configure the CloudCannon editors later in this guide. For now, here’s an overview of each one.

### Visual Editor

[The Visual Editor](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/introducing-the-visual-editor/) is the most intuitive way to edit content on CloudCannon, with editable elements indicated on a preview of your site. Your content team can click on any editable element to change its content and see those changes as they would appear live.

![The Visual Editor in the CloudCannon app shows a pop-up for editing content in a live preview of the home page.](https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/CloudCannon-Getting-Started-Visual-Editor-Popup.png "Visual editor pop-up")

The Visual Editor also features a sidebar for managing front matter content. You can customize these inputs to give your editing team a more intuitive interface. For example, add a date picker for a date field, including a small comment to indicate how a field should be used, or use a select box to reference other pages on the site or data in a data file.

### Content Editor

[The Content Editor](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/introducing-the-content-editor/) is a rich text editor for Markdown files. This editor is useful if you want a distraction-free, clean writing interface, particularly for blog posts and other content with a simple layout. The Content Editor view also shows the Data Editor in the left-hand panel, as pictured below.

### Data Editor

We have already seen the [Data Editor](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/introducing-the-data-editor/) — the sidebar for managing front matter in the Visual and Content Editor. The Data Editor also manages content in YAML, TOML, JSON, CSV, and TSV files.

![The Data Editor in the CloudCannon app shows editable fields for a data file.](https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/CloudCannon-Getting-Started-Data-Editor.png "Data editor")

### Source Editor

[The Source Editor](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/introducing-the-source-editor/) is an in-browser code editor, great for making small, quick changes. As with all the Editors, any changes sync back to your Git repository.
