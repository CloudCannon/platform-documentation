## What is CloudCannon?

<comp.Slot name="Intro_paragraph">
         CloudCannon is a Git-based Content Management System. With CloudCannon, you can easily build and maintain your<comp.CommonParam parameters={parameters} parameter="SSG_Name" />Site using familiar Git workflows. Plus, your content team can effortlessly update and manage the content without knowing anything about<comp.CommonParam parameters={parameters} parameter="SSG_Name" append="," />Git, Markdown, or HTML.

         If building on CloudCannon isn't the right option for you, please read our guide on setting up [CloudCannon in Headless Mode](/documentation/guides/headless-starter-guide/).

## Syncing your files with CloudCannon

To create a Site, CloudCannon needs to sync your website files from their current location. You can:

* Upload files from local storage.
* Connect CloudCannon to your Git provider (we recommend this method).
* Start with a CloudCannon template and push it to your Git provider.

This guide covers how to create a Site using files stored on a Git provider.

If you havenâ€™t already, <a href="https://app.cloudcannon.com/register" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sign up for CloudCannon</a>. After logging in and selecting an Organization, click on the *Sites* button in the *App Sidebar*.

You can add a new Site to CloudCannon using the *\+ Add new Site* button at the top right of the *Sites* page. In the *Create a Site* modal, click the *Use your own files* option.

Select the Git provider you use for your site files using the *File source* dropdown. CloudCannon supports <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-github-repository-as-your-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-bitbucket-respository-as-your-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitbucket</a>, <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-gitlab-respository-as-your-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitLab</a>, and <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-self-hosted-gitlab-repository-as-your-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-hosted GitLab</a>.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If this is your first time using CloudCannon, you must give CloudCannon permission to access your Git provider.

  Select your Git provider using the *File source* dropdown, then click the *Authenticate* button. CloudCannon will forward you to your Git provider login screen.

After confirming your Git platform, the repository field will list all the available repositories on your account. Select your site repository.

Select an existing branch or create a new one. Most likely, you will want to select *Use an existing branch*. However, select *Create a new branch* if you want to try CloudCannon without impacting your main branch.

Name your site. CloudCannon will automatically populate this field with the name of the repository you selected, but you can choose any name for your site.
