## What is CloudCannon?

<comp.Slot name="Intro_paragraph">
  CloudCannon is a Git-based Content Management System. With CloudCannon, you can easily build and maintain your <comp.CommonParam parameters={parameters} parameter="SSG_Name" /> Site using familiar Git workflows. Plus, your content team can effortlessly update and manage the content without knowing anything about <comp.CommonParam parameters={parameters} parameter="SSG_Name" append="," /> Git, Markdown, or HTML.

  If building on CloudCannon isn't the right option for you, please read our guide on setting up [CloudCannon in Headless Mode](/documentation/guides/headless-starter-guide/).

To create a Site in CloudCannon ... sync what...

Select the Git provider you use for your site files. CloudCannon supports <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-github-repository-as-your-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-bitbucket-respository-as-your-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitbucket</a>, <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-gitlab-respository-as-your-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitLab</a>, and <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-self-hosted-gitlab-repository-as-your-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-hosted GitLab</a>. If this is your first time using CloudCannon, you must give CloudCannon permission to access the Git platform.

Select an existing branch or create a new one. Most likely, you will want to select *Use an existing branch*. However, select *Create a new branch* if you want to try CloudCannon without impacting your main branch.

Name your site. CloudCannon will automatically populate this field with the name of the repository you selected, but you can choose any name for your site.

Click the *Sync Files* button at the bottom of the page.
