Welcome to the CloudCannon <comp.CommonParam parameters={parameters} parameter="SSG_Name" /> starter guide! If you want to get your <comp.CommonParam parameters={parameters} parameter="SSG_Name" /> site set up on CloudCannon site built, editable, and live on CloudCannon, you are in the right place.

Before we start, this guide assumes you already have a <comp.CommonParam parameters={parameters} parameter="SSG_Name" /> site uploaded to a Git repository. Although you can <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/add-files-with-direct-upload/">upload files directly</a> from your hard drive, we highly recommend using a Git repository.

Don’t have a <comp.CommonParam parameters={parameters} parameter="SSG_Name" /> site yet? No worries! You can create one with our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/tutorials/">Jamstack tutorials for your favorite SSGs</a>.

## What is CloudCannon?

CloudCannon is a Git-based CMS designed for websites built with a static site generator. With CloudCannon, you can easily build and maintain your <comp.CommonParam parameters={parameters} parameter="SSG_Name" /> site using familiar Git workflows. Plus, your content team can effortlessly update and manage the content without knowing anything about <comp.CommonParam parameters={parameters} parameter="SSG_Name" />, Git, Markdown, or HTML.

## Setting up your site

### Syncing to CloudCannon

If you haven’t already, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://app.cloudcannon.com/register">sign up for CloudCannon</a> and create a new site using the ‘Build with your own files’ option.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/CloudCannon-Getting-Started-Own-Files.png" alt="An app pop-up with two options for creating a new site in CloudCannon, 'Edit with a template' or 'Build with your own files'." title="Build a new site with your own files" type="ui-snippet"/>

Enter a site name and select the Git platform your site lives on. CloudCannon supports <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-github-repository-as-your-source/">GitHub</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-bitbucket-respository-as-your-source/">Bitbucket</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-gitlab-respository-as-your-source/">GitLab</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-self-hosted-gitlab-repository-as-your-source/">self-hosted GitLab</a>. If this is your first time using CloudCannon, you must give CloudCannon permission to access the Git platform.

After confirming your Git platform, the repository field will list all the available repositories on your account. Select your site repository.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/CloudCannon-Getting-Started-Select-Repository.png" alt="A screenshot of the CloudCannon app shows a field to select your new site's git repository." title="Select your site repository" type="screenshot"/>

Select an existing branch or create a new one. Most likely, you will want to select ‘Use existing’. However, if you want to try CloudCannon without impacting your main branch, select ‘Create new’.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/CloudCannon-Getting-Started-Select-Branch.png" alt="A screenshot of the CloudCannon app shows a new or existing branch selector and a dropdown menu to select an existing branch." title="Select your site branch" type="screenshot"/>

Click ‘Sync Files’ at the bottom right.

### Building your site

CloudCannon will auto-detect which static site generator your repository is using. However, if it gets your SSG wrong, you can select the correct one from the dropdown menu.

<comp.Slot name="SSG_Build_Stage_Image"></comp.Slot>

Enter the necessary build options so your site matches your local build environment. You may not need to enter anything here if you have a simple setup. If you have a custom source directory or require environment variables for parts of your build, enter them here.

Some important things to consider include:

<comp.Slot name="SSG_Common_Build_Options"></comp.Slot>

* Any required environment variables.
* Install Command: Configure the command to install dependencies before the build. By default, this runs `npm install`. This is run as a line of bash and can be anything you want. A common change here is to use `yarn install` instead.
* Build Command: Configure the command to build your site. By default, this runs `npm run build`. This is similar to the install command. An example of this command is <comp.CommonParam parameters={parameters} parameter="Build_Command" />.
* Output Path: Configure the path to the output folder you are building into. CloudCannon needs to know which folder to treat as the static output of your site. <comp.CommonParam parameters={parameters} parameter="Default_Build_Folder" />

Once you have finished, click ‘Build Site’.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/CloudCannon-Getting-Started-Successful-Build.png" alt="A screenshot of the CloudCannon app shows a green tick to indicate that your build was successful." title="Successful build" type="screenshot"/>

If your site builds successfully, you are ready to go on CloudCannon! As a bonus, CloudCannon also provides hosting. You can now access the live preview version of your site (not indexed by search engines) by clicking on the ‘Live site preview →’ button in the top left of the app. This will take you to your unique *.cloudvent.net* address.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Your new adjective-noun.cloudvent.net site will give you a preview after every change. Share this URL to show off your new site before your changes go live!
</comp.Notice>

If your site fails to build, you will have some debugging work to do. Read the build output or check the Status page to see the Build Suggestions for your site. Double-check your build settings and try again.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  If the site returned a 404 on the index, you might have set the wrong output path. This can indicate that no files were present in the configured folder.
</comp.Notice>

<comp.Slot name="SSG_Common_Build_Errors"></comp.Slot>

You may need to run extra commands before or after your build to get your site in the right state. For example, you may need to install npm packages for your site.

On CloudCannon, you can run extra commands at different points of the build using a build hook. For more information, see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/extending-your-build-process-with-hooks/">the build hook documentation</a>.

If you can’t figure out why your site failed to build, don’t hesitate to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/support/">get in touch with our support team</a>. We’re always here to help.
