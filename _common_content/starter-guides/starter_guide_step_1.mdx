Learn how to set up your website on the CloudCannon <comp.CommonParam parameters={parameters} parameter="SSG Name" /> CMS.

<comp.Youtube id="Vk5R5c1tJX8"/>

Welcome to the CloudCannon <comp.CommonParam parameters={parameters} parameter="SSG Name" /> starter guide! If you want to get your <comp.CommonParam parameters={parameters} parameter="SSG Name" /> site set up on CloudCannon site built, editable, and live on CloudCannon, you are in the right place.

Before we start, this guide assumes you already have a <comp.CommonParam parameters={parameters} parameter="SSG Name" /> site uploaded to a Git repository. Although you can [upload files directly](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/add-files-with-direct-upload/) from your hard drive, we highly recommend using a Git repository.

Don’t have a <comp.CommonParam parameters={parameters} parameter="SSG Name" /> site yet? No worries! You can create one with our [Jamstack tutorials for your favorite SSGs](https://cloudcannon.com/tutorials/).

## &nbsp;What is CloudCannon?

CloudCannon is a Git-based CMS designed for websites built with a static site generator. With CloudCannon, you can easily build and maintain your&nbsp;<comp.CommonParam parameters={parameters} parameter="SSG Name" /> site using familiar Git workflows. Plus, your content team can effortlessly update and manage the content without knowing anything about&nbsp;<comp.CommonParam parameters={parameters} parameter="SSG Name" />, Git, Markdown, or HTML.

## Setting up your site

### Syncing to CloudCannon

If you haven’t already,&nbsp;[sign up for CloudCannon](https://app.cloudcannon.com/register)&nbsp;and create a new site using the ‘Build with your own files’ option.

Enter a site name and select the Git platform your site lives on. CloudCannon supports&nbsp;[GitHub](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-github-repository-as-your-source/),&nbsp;[Bitbucket](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-bitbucket-respository-as-your-source/),&nbsp;[GitLab](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-gitlab-respository-as-your-source/), and&nbsp;[self-hosted GitLab](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/connecting-a-self-hosted-gitlab-repository-as-your-source/). If this is your first time using CloudCannon, you must give CloudCannon permission to access the Git platform.

After confirming your Git platform, the repository field will list all the available repositories on your account. Select your site repository.

Select an existing branch or create a new one. Most likely, you will want to select ‘Use existing’. However, if you want to try CloudCannon without impacting your main branch, select ‘Create new’.

Click ‘Sync Files’ at the bottom right.

### Building your site

CloudCannon will auto-detect which static site generator your repository is using. However, if it gets your SSG wrong, you can select the correct one from the drop-down menu.

Enter the necessary build options so your site matches your local build environment. You may not need to enter anything here if you have a simple setup. If you have a custom source directory or require environment variables for parts of your build, enter them here.

Some important things to consider include:

* Any required environment variables.
* Install Command: Configure the command to install dependencies before the build. By default, this runs `npm install`. This is run as a line of bash and can be anything you want. A common change here is to use `yarn install` instead.
* Build Command: Configure the command to build your site. By default, this runs `npm run build`. This is similar to the install command. An example of this build is&nbsp;<comp.CommonParam parameters={parameters} parameter="Build Command" />.
* Output Path: Configure the path to the output folder you are building into. CloudCannon needs to know which folder to treat as the static output of your site.
