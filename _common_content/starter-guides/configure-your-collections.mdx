You can already [edit your files](/documentation/articles/edit-your-files/) in CloudCannon and [save your changes](/documentation/articles/save-your-changes/) to your Git repository, but let's customize the editing experience for your team members. In the next few steps of this guide, we'll review key configurations that will help you understand CloudCannon better and give you the tools to customize your experience.

Let's configure your [Collections](/documentation/articles/define-your-collections/)!

There are multiple ways you can configure the appearance and functionality of your Collections, such as:

* Adding a description or documentation link to the *Collection browser* page.
* Configuring the output URL of your files.
* Creating globs to control which files are visible in your Collection browser.
* Configuring which editing interfaces are permitted for Collection files.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  You can familiarize yourself these settings by browsing your CloudCannon configuration file in the Data Editor. If you want to undertake some self-directed exploration you can open your CloudCannon configuration file by clicking on *Site Settings* in your *Site Navigation*, opening the *Editing* page, and clicking the *Edit your configuration file* button.
</comp.Notice>

To begin, we'll configure how your Collections appear in your *Site Navigation*, how your file cards appear in your *Collection browser*, and create a schema for our team members to use as a template for new files.

* **Card**—A card is a square user interface element that previews the data it represents in CloudCannon. Your files are represented by file cards in the *Collection browser*.
* **Schema** — A <a href="/documentation/articles/what-is-a-schema/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">schema</a> is a predefined template determining what should populate a Collection file. You can configure several schemas for each Collection, creating a list of file templates for you and your team.

  ## Collection appearance configuration

  When we generated our CloudCannon configuration file earlier in this guide, CloudCannon automatically chose an icon for each Collection from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Icons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Material Icons</a> list based on its name. You could reorder

  Here's an example. On this Site, we have five Collections, three of which output to pages on our website (Pages, Blog, and Products) and two of which contain data files (Data and Staff Members).

  <comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/guides/getting-started/2024-10/CloudCannon-Documentation-Configure-Navigation-Collections-Before.png" alt="A screenshot of five Collections in the Site Navigation." title="Collections in the Site Navigation" type="ui-snippet"/>

  Some of these icons aren't quite right. For example, CloudCannon chose the `card_membership` icon for the Staff Members Collection because it shares the word "member". Let's change some icons.

  Additionally, the name of the Data Collection doesn't accurately communicate it's contents. This Collection contains data files for the Site's navigation, footer, meta data, and blog tags. Let's rename this Collection in the *Site Navigation* without changing the name of the folder in our Git repository.

  Finally, CloudCannon has automatically grouped all our Collections together. Let's add Collection groups to our *Site* *Navigation* to create a visual distinction between output and non-output Collections.

  Open your CloudCannon configuration file by clicking *Site Settings* in your *Site Navigation*. Then, open the *Editing* page. Click the *Edit your configuration file* button.

  <comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/guides/getting-started/2024-09/CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Settings-Editing-Page.png" alt="" title="" type="screenshot"/>

  Navigate to the *Collections* section under *Collections and Paths*  in your CloudCannon configuration file. CloudCannon lists all your Collections here. You can click on any Collection to see the configuration settings specific to that Collection.

  <comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/guides/getting-started/2024-09/CloudCannon-Documentation-Configuration-File-Collections-Section.png" alt="" title="" type="screenshot"/>

  First, let's open the Staff Members Collection. There are four sections inside each Collection for *Collection setup*, *Collection display*, *Collection editing interfaces*, and *Creating and updating pages*.

  To update the icon for a collection, navigate to the *Icon* dropdown under *Collection display*.

  <comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/guides/getting-started/2024-09/CloudCannon-Documentation-Configuration-File-Collection-Panel.png" alt="" title="" type="screenshot"/>

  The *Icon* dropdown

  Change the Staff members icon to `groups`. While we're

  Blog to `post_add`, Products to `inventory_2`, and Data to `important_devices`.

## Save your Collection configuration

Once you have finished making edits to your <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/create-a-global-configuration-file/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CloudCannon configuration file</a>, you can save your changes using the *Save* button in the top right of the Data Editor.

CloudCannon will push your `cloudcannon.config.yml` file back to your repository.

### Schemas

Use [schemas](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-schema/) to keep your files consistent. Configuring your schemas for each collection will help you to:

* Populate the front matter of a new file created in the CloudCannon app.
* Update the front matter for existing files in your collection.
* Customize the types of content you can add to a collection through the *\+ Add* button in the top right.

You can define the `schemas` for each collection in the global configuration file. These sections look like this in the configuration GUI:

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/CloudCannon-Getting-Started-Configure-Schemas.png" alt="A screenshot of the CloudCannon configuration GUI shows the section allowing users to configure schemas for each collection." title="Configuration GUI Schemas Section" type="ui-snippet"/>

Schema files are the same file type as the file you want to create. For example, you must use a Markdown schema to create a new Markdown file in your collection. You can have multiple schemas for each collection, each with a different file type and contents.

In your schema, you define the inputs for the front matter of all files using this schema.

Here is a simple example of a Markdown schema:

<comp.CodeBlock language="Markdown" source="blog.md">
```
---
title:
author:
image:
---
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Once you have created your schemas, you can configure each collection to reference a particular schema in the configuration GUI. New files in that collection will automatically have the correct front matter. When you edit an existing file in a collection with a defined schema, the front matter will update to keep data consistent.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Updating your schema file will alter the inputs for all the files that use that schema. This means you will only have to make changes in one place! Be careful, however, as unintended changes will overwrite the front matter of many files.
</comp.Notice>

CloudCannon will automatically display the schemas available for your collection as a drop-down menu from the *\+ Add* button.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/CloudCannon-Getting-Started-Add-Schemas.png" alt="A screenshot of the Collections view in the CloudCannon app shows a drop-down menu with multiple schema options for new content." title="Add content using multiple schemas" type="ui-snippet"/>

You can further <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/configure-the-add-button-in-collections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">customize your + Add button</a> through `add_options`; however, this isn’t necessary to get started on CloudCannon.

When you have created your CloudCannon global configuration file, your schemas will look something like this:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
```
