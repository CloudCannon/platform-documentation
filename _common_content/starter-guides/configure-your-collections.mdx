You can already [edit your files](/documentation/articles/edit-your-files/) in CloudCannon and [save your changes](/documentation/articles/save-your-changes/) to your Git repository, but let's customize the editing experience for your team members. In the next few steps of this guide, we'll review key configurations that will help you understand CloudCannon better and give you the tools to customize your experience.

Let's configure your [Collections](/documentation/articles/define-your-collections/)!

There are multiple ways you can configure the appearance and functionality of your Collections, such as:

* Adding a description or documentation link to the *Collection browser* page.
* Configuring the output URL of your files.
* Creating globs to control which files are visible in your Collection browser.
* Configuring which editing interfaces are permitted for Collection files.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  You can familiarize yourself these settings by browsing your CloudCannon configuration file in the Data Editor. If you want to undertake some self-directed exploration you can open your CloudCannon configuration file by clicking on *Site Settings* in your *Site Navigation*, opening the *Editing* page, and clicking the *Edit your configuration file* button.
</comp.Notice>

To begin, we'll configure how your Collections appear in your *Site Navigation*, how your file cards appear in your *Collection browser*, and create a Schema for our team members to use as a template for new files.

  ## Collection appearance configuration

  We generated our CloudCannon configuration file earlier in this guide,  which added our Collections to the *Site Navigation*. Here's an example. On this Site, we have five Collections, three of which output to pages on our website (Pages, Blog, and Products) and two containing data files (Data and Staff Members).

  <comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/guides/getting-started/2024-10/CloudCannon-Documentation-Configure-Navigation-Collections-Before.png" alt="A screenshot of five Collections in the Site Navigation." title="Collections in the Site Navigation" type="ui-snippet"/>

  Let's configure how these Collections appear in the *Site Navigation*. You can follow along and update the appearance of your own Collections as we go.

  Open your CloudCannon configuration file by clicking *Site Settings* in your *Site Navigation*. Then, open the *Editing* page. Click the *Edit your configuration file* button to open your CloudCannon configuration file in the Data Editor.

  <comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/guides/getting-started/2024-09/CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Settings-Editing-Page.png" alt="A screenshot of the Editing page in Site Settings shows the Edit your configuration file button." title="The Editing page" type="screenshot"/>

  Navigate to the *Collections* section under *Collections and Paths*. CloudCannon lists all your Collections here. You can click on any Collection to see the configuration settings specific to that Collection.

  <comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/guides/getting-started/2024-09/CloudCannon-Documentation-Configuration-File-Collections-Section.png" alt="A screenshot of the CloudCannon configuration file open in the Data Editor shows an array containing Site Collections." title="The CloudCannon configuration file" type="screenshot"/>

  When you generate the configuration file, CloudCannon automatically chooses an icon for each Collection from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Icons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Material Icons</a> list based on its name. Some of these icons aren't quite right. For example, CloudCannon chose the `card_membership` icon for the Staff Members Collection because it shares the word "member". Let's change some icons.

  First, let's open the Staff Members Collection. There are four sections on the Collection configuration panel: *Collection setup*, *Collection display*, *Collection editing interfaces*, and *Creating and updating pages*.

  To update the icon for a Collection, navigate to the *Icon* dropdown under *Collection display*.

  <comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/guides/getting-started/2024-09/CloudCannon-Documentation-Configuration-File-Collection-Panel.png" alt="A screenshot of the CloudCannon configuration file open in the Data Editor shows the Collection display configuration panel." title="The CloudCannon configuration file" type="screenshot"/>

  Using the *Icon* dropdown inside each Collection, let's change the Staff Members icon to `groups`, Blog to `post_add`, Products to `inventory_2`, and Data to `important_devices`.

  Next, the name of the Data Collection doesn't accurately communicate its contents to non-technical team members. This Collection contains data files for the Site's navigation, footer, metadata, and blog tags. Let's rename this Collection to "Site Elements" in the *Site Navigation*.

  To update the display name for a Collection, navigate to the *Name* text input under *Collection display*. CloudCannon automatically generates the display name for a Collection based on its key. Updating the display name does not affect the key name for the Collection or the folder name in your Git repository. Using the *Name* text input, let's change the display name for the Data Collection to "Site Elements".

  Finally, CloudCannon has automatically grouped all our Collections together in the *Site Navigation*. Let's add Collection groups to create a visual distinction between output and non-output Collections.

  To add Collection Groups, navigate to the *Collection Groups* section under *Collections and Paths*.

  <comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/guides/getting-started/2024-09/CloudCannon-Documentation-Configuration-File-Collection-Groups-Section.png" alt="A screenshot of the CloudCannon configuration file open in the Data Editor shows the Collection Group configuration section." title="The CloudCannon configuration file" type="screenshot"/>

  Click the *\+ Add Collection Group* button to open the *Collection Group* configuration panel. In the *Heading* text input, enter the name of the group. This will appear above your Collection items in the *Site Navigation*.

  Click the *\+ Add Collection* button to create a new Text input in the *Collections* array. Enter the Collection key name (i.e., not the display name) for each Collection you want to include in the group. You can reorder the Collections within a group using this Array input, or reorder the groups in your *Site Navigation* using the Array input under the *Collection Group* section.

  <comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/guides/getting-started/2024-09/CloudCannon-Documentation-Configuration-File-Collection-Group-Panel.png" alt="A screenshot of the CloudCannon configuration file open in the Data Editor shows the Collection Group configuration panel." title="The CloudCannon configuration file" type="screenshot"/>

  In this example, we'll create two Collection groups: "Content", which contains the `pages`, `blog`, and `products` Collections, and "Data Files", which contains the `staff_members` and `data` Collections.

  <comp.Notice info_type="info">
    Make sure to spell the Collection key name correctly when adding it to a Collection Group.
  </comp.Notice>

  After these configuration updates, here is what the Collections in our *Site Navigation* look like.

  <comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/guides/getting-started/2024-10/CloudCannon-Documentation-Configure-Navigation-Collections-After.png" alt="A screenshot of five Collections in the Site Navigation, with updated icons, display names, and collection groups." title="Collections in the Site Navigation" type="ui-snippet"/>

  If you would prefer to configure the appearance of your Collections in the Source Editor or your local development environment, you can achieve the same configuration with the following code:

  <comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
                        ```

                        collections_config:
                          pages:
                            path: content
                            name: Pages
                            icon: wysiwyg
                          blog:
                            path: content/blog
                            name: Blog
                            icon: post_add
                          products:
                            path: content/products
                            name: Products
                            icon: inventory_2
                          data:
                            path: data
                            name: Site Elements
                            icon: important_devices
                          staff_members:
                            path: content/staff-members
                            name: Staff Members
                            icon: groups
                        collection_groups:
                          - heading: Content
                            collections:
                              - pages
                              - blog
                              - products
                          - heading: Data Files
                            collections:
                              - staff_members
                              - data

                        ```
                        </comp.MultiCodeBlock>

<comp.Slot name="File-Card-configuration">
  ## File card configuration

  A card is a square user interface element that previews the data it represents in CloudCannon. Your files are represented by file cards in the *Collection browser*.
</comp.Slot>

<comp.Slot name="Schema-configuration">
  ## Schema configuration

  A <a href="/documentation/articles/what-is-a-schema/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">schema</a> is a predefined template that determines what should populate a Collection file. You can configure several Schemas for each Collection, creating a list of file templates for you and your team. You can select a Schema using the *\+ Add* button dropdown in the top right of your *Collection browser*.

  Schemas help you keep files consistent within a Collection. When you create a new Collection file, CloudCannon will automatically populate the file's front matter with inputs and structured data from your Schema. CloudCannon will also update the front matter to match your Schema when you open an existing file.

  Schema files are the same file type as the file you want to create. For example, you must use a Markdown Schema to create a new Markdown file in your Collection.

  <comp.Notice info_type="info">
    For more information about the default CloudCannon behavior for Collections with no configured Schemas, please read our documentation on [schemas](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-schema/#default-behavior-for-new-collection-files).
  </comp.Notice>

  Let's walk through an example. You can follow along and add Schemas to your own Collections as we go.

  We want to create a blog post Schema for our Blog Collection. This Schema will contain four structured data keys in the front matter: `title`, `date`, `author`, and `image`. When our team members create a new file using this Schema, they can enter values for these keys using inputs in the sidebar of the Content Editor (we'll cover input configuration in a later step of this guide).

  To add a Schema, create the template Schema file using the File Browser or your local development environment. We recommend saving all your Schemas in a dedicated "Schemas" folder in the root directory of your Git repository.

  Here's our Schema file:

  <comp.CodeBlock language="Markdown" source="blog-post.md">
                  ```
                  ---
                  title:
                  date:
                  author:
                  image:
                  ---
                  ```
                  </comp.CodeBlock>

  Next, let's connect our `post.md` Schema to the Blog Collection.

  To connect a Schema to a Collection, open your CloudCannon configuration file in the Data Editor. Navigate to the *Collections* section under *Collections and Paths* and click on the Collection you want to configure. You'll find the *Schemas* section under *Creating and updating pages*.

  <comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/guides/getting-started/2024-09/CloudCannon-Documentation-Configuration-File-Schemas-Section.png" alt="A screenshot of the CloudCannon configuration file open in the Data Editor shows the Schemas configuration section." title="The CloudCannon configuration file" type="screenshot"/>

  Click the *\+ Add Schema* button to open the *Add Schema* modal. In the *New key name* text input, enter the name of your Schema and then click the *Add* button. CloudCannon will open the Schema configuration panel.

  The Schema configuration panel has four sections: *Schema setup*, *Schema display*, *Editing interfaces*, and *Advanced*. Under Schema setup, navigate to the *Path* text input and enter the file path for your Schema. In this example, the file path is `schemas/post.md`.

  CloudCannon will automatically show your connected Schema in the *\+ Add* button dropdown for the relevant Collection, prefixed by "Add". When you click on a Schema option, CloudCannon will create a new file with the correct front matter fields.

  <comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/guides/getting-started/2024-09/CloudCannon-Documentation-Content-Editor-From-Schema.png" alt="A screenshot of the Content Editor shows a blank blog file with empty inputs for title, date, author, and image in the sidebar." title="The Content Editor" type="screenshot"/>

  You can configure the appearance of each Schema in the *\+ Add* dropdown to create more visual distinction for your team members. This is useful if you have multiple Schemas for a given Collection.

  In this example, we have two Schemas: `post.md` and `customer-story.md`. Let's update the display name of the `post.md` Schema and add icons.

  To update the display name and icon for a Schema, navigate to the *Name* text input and the *Icon* dropdown under *Schema display*. We'll update the display name for `post.md` to "Blog Post" and the icon to `post_add`. Additionally, let's update the icon for `customer-story.md` to `auto_stories`.

  After these configuration updates, here is what the Schemas list in the *\+ Add* dropdown looks like.

  <comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/guides/getting-started/2024-09/CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Add-Dropdown.png" alt="A screenshot of the Blog Collection browser with the Add dropdown open shows two Schemas, Blog Post and Customer Story." title="The Collection browser" type="ui-snippet"/>

  If you would prefer to configure the appearance of your Collections in the Source Editor or your local development environment, you can achieve the same configuration with the following code:

  <comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
              ```

              collections_config:
                blog:
                  schemas:
                    post:
                      path: schemas/post.md
                      name: Blog Post
                      icon: post_add
                    customer_story:
                      path: schemas/customer-story.md
                      icon: auto_stories

              ```
              </comp.MultiCodeBlock>
</comp.Slot>

## Save your Collection configuration

Once you have finished making edits to your <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/create-a-global-configuration-file/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CloudCannon configuration file</a>, you can save your changes using the *Save* button in the top right of the Data Editor.

CloudCannon will push your `cloudcannon.config.yml` file back to your repository.
