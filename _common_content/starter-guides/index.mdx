Learn how to set up your website on the CloudCannon <comp.Sub key="ssg" omittable={true} /> CMS.

<comp.Youtube id="Vk5R5c1tJX8" />

<comp.Slot name="build_warning"></comp.Slot>

Welcome to the CloudCannon <comp.Sub key="ssg" omittable={true} /> starter guide! If you want to get your <comp.Sub key="ssg" omittable={true} /> site set up on CloudCannon site built, editable, and live on CloudCannon, you are in the right place.

Before we start, this guide assumes you already have a <comp.Sub key="ssg" omittable={true} /> site uploaded to a Git repository. Although you can [upload files directly](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/add-files-with-direct-upload/) from your hard drive, we highly recommend using a Git repository.

Donâ€™t have a <comp.Sub key="ssg" omittable={true} /> site yet? No worries! You can create one with our [Jamstack tutorials for your favorite SSGs](https://cloudcannon.com/tutorials/).
