  Welcome to the end of the guide! We’ve covered everything you need to know to get started — but it doesn’t end there! Here are some optional steps for you to explore.

  ## Hosting

  CloudCannon is an all-in-one Content Management System with hosting included. Every site has its own [Testing Domain](/documentation/articles/testing-domain/) and is hosted on a super-fast Content Delivery Network (CDN) supported by Cloudflare. For a production site, you can point your [Custom Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/) at your Site or use [CloudCannon DNS](/documentation/articles/configure-cloudcannon-dns/) to automate the setup.

  All sites receive an SSL certificate, can easily scale to handle any amount of traffic, and offer [custom routing and headers](/documentation/articles/what-is-routing/), <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/getting-started-with-forms-on-cloudcannon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">form submissions</a>, and <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/adding-password-authentication-to-your-site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">various authentication options</a>.

## Branding

Adding your brand to CloudCannon is a great way to make the app look and feel like your organization.

You can set your primary color — this is mainly used in the side nav and buttons. Your logo is used in two places: a badge in the top left corner with your brand's primary color behind it and on the top of the *Home*, *Project*, *Sites*, and *Domains* pages with a white background behind it.
