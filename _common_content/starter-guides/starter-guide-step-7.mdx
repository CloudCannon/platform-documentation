## Hosting

CloudCannon is an all-in-one Content Management System (CMS) with hosting included. Every site has its own&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/viewing-your-site-on-a-testing-domain/">.cloudvent.net domain name</a>&nbsp;and is hosted on a super-fast Content Delivery Network (CDN) supported by Cloudflare. For a production site, you can&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/hosting-your-site-on-a-custom-domain/">point your domain to your site</a>&nbsp;or use&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/using-cloudcannon-dns-to-configure-your-custom-domain/">CloudCannon DNS</a>&nbsp;to automate the setup.

All sites receive an SSL certificate, can easily scale to handle any amount of traffic, and offer&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/configuring-custom-routing/#custom-headers">custom routing and headers</a>,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/getting-started-with-forms-on-cloudcannon/">form submissions</a>, and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/adding-password-authentication-to-your-site/">various authentication options</a>.

## Next Steps (optional)

We’ve covered everything you need to know to get started — but it doesn’t end there! Here are some optional steps for you to explore.
