## Hosting

CloudCannon is an all-in-one Content Management System (CMS) with hosting included. Every site has its own&nbsp;[.cloudvent.net domain name](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/viewing-your-site-on-a-testing-domain/)&nbsp;and is hosted on a super-fast Content Delivery Network (CDN) supported by Cloudflare. For a production site, you can&nbsp;[point your domain to your site](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/hosting-your-site-on-a-custom-domain/)&nbsp;or use&nbsp;[CloudCannon DNS](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/using-cloudcannon-dns-to-configure-your-custom-domain/)&nbsp;to automate the setup.

All sites receive an SSL certificate, can easily scale to handle any amount of traffic, and offer&nbsp;[custom routing and headers](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/configuring-custom-routing/#custom-headers),&nbsp;[form submissions](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/getting-started-with-forms-on-cloudcannon/), and&nbsp;[various authentication options](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/adding-password-authentication-to-your-site/).

## Next Steps (optional)

We’ve covered everything you need to know to get started — but it doesn’t end there! Here are some optional steps for you to explore.

### Bookshop

We’ve created&nbsp;[Bookshop](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop)&nbsp;to automate maintaining page components for page building. Bookshop is an open-source component library for \[SSG\_name\] and other SSGs. It’s simple to set up and has tight integration into CloudCannon, which will handle most of the setup.

To get started with Bookshop, take a look at the&nbsp;[Hugo Bookshop starter guide](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop/blob/main/guides/hugo.adoc)&nbsp;or a full tutorial on converting&nbsp;[Bootstrap to Hugo + Bookshop](https://cloudcannon.com/community/learn/bootstrap-to-a-client-editable-hugo-site/).
