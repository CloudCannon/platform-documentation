### Building your site

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If your website is Dynamic, building on CloudCannon may not be possible. For example, CloudCannon cannot host your Site if you require server-side functions or a persistent server. Luckily, builds are not required to use CloudCannon as a headless CMS.

  Please read our guide on using [CloudCannon in Headless Mode](/documentation/guides/headless-starter-guide/introduction/).
</comp.Notice>

<comp.Slot name="SSG_Build_Site_Paragraph">
  CloudCannon will auto-detect which static site generator your repository is using. However, if it gets your SSG wrong, you can select the correct one from the dropdown menu.

  Enter the necessary build options so your site matches your local build environment. You may not need to enter anything here if you have a simple setup. If you have a custom source directory or require environment variables for parts of your build, enter them here.
</comp.Slot>

Once you have finished, click *Build Site*.

If your site builds successfully, you are ready to go on CloudCannon! As a bonus, CloudCannon also provides hosting. You can now access the live preview version of your site (not indexed by search engines) by clicking on the *Live site preview* button in the top left of the app. This will take you to your unique *.cloudvent.net* address.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Your new adjective-noun.cloudvent.net site will give you a preview after every change. Share this URL to show off your new site before your changes go live!
</comp.Notice>

If your site fails to build, you will have some debugging work to do. Read the build output or check the Status page to see the suggested fixes for your site. Double-check your build settings and try again.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  If the site returned a 404 on the index, you might have set the wrong output path. This can indicate that no files were present in the configured folder.
</comp.Notice>

You may need to run extra commands before or after your build to get your site in the right state. For example, you may need to install npm packages for your site.

On CloudCannon, you can run extra commands at different points of the build using a build hook. For more information, see <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/extending-your-build-process-with-hooks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the build hook documentation</a>.

If you can’t figure out why your site failed to build, don’t hesitate to <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get in touch with our support team</a>. We’re always here to help.
