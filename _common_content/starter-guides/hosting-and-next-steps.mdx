## Hosting

CloudCannon is an all-in-one Content Management System with hosting included. Every site has its own <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/viewing-your-site-on-a-testing-domain/">.cloudvent.net domain name</a> and is hosted on a super-fast Content Delivery Network (CDN) supported by Cloudflare. For a production site, you can <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/hosting-your-site-on-a-custom-domain/">point your domain to your site</a> or use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/using-cloudcannon-dns-to-configure-your-custom-domain/">CloudCannon DNS</a> to automate the setup.

All sites receive an SSL certificate, can easily scale to handle any amount of traffic, and offer <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/configuring-custom-routing/#custom-headers">custom routing and headers</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/getting-started-with-forms-on-cloudcannon/">form submissions</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/adding-password-authentication-to-your-site/">various authentication options</a>.

## Next Steps (optional)

We’ve covered everything you need to know to get started — but it doesn’t end there! Here are some optional steps for you to explore.

### Branding

Adding your brand to CloudCannon is a great way to make the app look and feel like your organization.

You can set your primary color — this is mainly used in the side nav and buttons. Your logo is used in two places: a badge in the top left corner with your brand's primary color behind it and on the top of the *Home*, *Project*, *Sites*, and *Domains* pages with a white background behind it.
