Flags are options that can change CloudCannon's default behaviour. This might mean opting into a feature that is still in development, or reverting to legacy behaviour.

You can turn flags on/off in your *Danger Zone / Flags* section of your *Site Settings*. These settings are in the *Danger Zone* because they all represent options that are not the default (recommended) behaviour on CloudCannon.

This article will explain the context behind each flag, and describe what it would mean to toggle them on/off.

## Image size attributes default behaviour

`image_size_attributes` is a configuration option that can be set for the [Content Editor](/documentation/edit/interfaces/content-editor) and [Editable Regions](/documentation/edit/editing/html#editable-regions), using the [configuration cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/). When `image_size_attributes` is `true`, CloudCannon will inject `width` and `height` attributes onto images that are added to rich text through the editor.

[See this article](/documentation/articles/why-cloudcannon-injects-width-and-height-onto-images/) for more information about why you might want CloudCannon to add these attributes to your images. One noteable disadvantage of this behaviour is that, depending on the Markdown engine used by your site, Markdown-formatted images may need to be converted to HTML.

This flag sets the default behaviour, when `image_size_attributes` is not explicitly configured. If this flag is turned on, any image input that does not explicitly have `image_size_attributes` configured will inject the attributes. In most cases, this flag will be turned off, meaning that the attributes will not be injected for any editing interface that does not have `image_size_attributes: true`.

**If you are considering turning this flag on, we would recommend using the `image_size_attributes` in your configuration instead.** This flag will be turned on for some sites to maintain the legacy behaviour where these attributes were always added to rich text images by default. 

## Legacy Collections Value Key

When you use a select input to reference a collection item, the value saved in your front matter is determined by [options.value_key](/documentation/articles/using-select-inputs-to-edit-your-data/#value_key) configured for your input. If this option has not been configured, the value will fallback to look for one of several sensible keys to pull from, like "id" and "title".

This flag exists to provide legacy behaviour to sites created before 25 November 2021. If turned on, select inputs that reference collection items, and which do not have `options.value_key` configured, will save a combination of the collection item's path, slug and id.

**It is not recommended to turn this flag on.** Instead, configure `options.value_key` for any select inputs that reference collections on your site.
