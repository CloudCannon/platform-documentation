By default, CloudCannon looks for your configuration file in the root directory of your Git repository. If you want your CloudCannon configuration file to be in a nested folder, you must define a custom file path.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Defining a custom file path for your CloudCannon configuration file is useful if your have multiple Sites in a single Git repositroy.
</comp.Notice>

To define a custom file path for your CloudCannon configuration file:

1. Navigate to the *Editing* page under *Site Settings*.
2. Under *CloudCannon Configuration Path*, enter the file path for your CloudCannon configuration file in the text field. Note: this file must have the `.json`, `.yaml`, or `.yml` file extension.
3. Click the *Update editing settings* button.

CloudCannon will now preferentially use the configuration file at this file path.
