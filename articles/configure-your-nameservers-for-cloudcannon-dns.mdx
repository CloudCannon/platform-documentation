<comp.Notice info_type="permissions">
  **Permissions required**

  Members of the Owners or Developers [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/), or [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/) with the `base-domain:settings:dns:read` permission, can view the DNS details on a Custom Domain's dedicated Domain page.

Short description and link to explanation article...

These instructions assume that you have [connected a Custom Domain to your Organization](/documentation/articles/connect-a-custom-domain-to-your-organization/) and selected CloudCannon DNS.

To configure your nameservers:

1. Log in to CloudCannon and select the Organization with the Custom Domain you want to update.
2. Click the *Domains* button in the *App Sidebar*. CloudCannon will open the *Domains browser*.
3. Identify the domain you want to update and click on the *Domain* card. CloudCannon will open the *Domain* page for this Custom Domain.
4. On the *Network* tab, CloudCannon will list the *Expected Nameservers* in an orange warning notification. Normally, these are "asa.ns.cloudflare.com" and "roan.ns.cloudflare.com".
5. Log in to your Domain Registrar with the account details used when you purchased your Domain Name. If you don't know who your Domain Registrar is, you can enter the Domain Name into the <a href="https://lookup.icann.org/en/lookup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICANN website</a>.
6. Follow your Domain Registrars instructions to update your nameservers to match the *Expected Nameservers* from CloudCannon.

Your Domain Registrar will process your updated nameservers. This should take a few minutes, but may take up to 24 hours. CloudCannon will check your Domain Registrar regularly and update the *Network* tab when it detects your Nameservers are setup correctly.
