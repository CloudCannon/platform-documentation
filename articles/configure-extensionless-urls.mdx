Extensionless URLs do not end with a trailing `/` character or a file extension.

A URL extension occurs at the end of a URL

In modern web development, many web developers prefer extensionless URLs

* Some experts suggest that search engines rank extensionless URLs more highly (however, the exact criteria used by search engines is not made public).

Extensionless URLs do not end with a trailing slash or a file extension. They map to the file in the same path with an `html`, `htm` or `xml` extension. For example, these URLs would serve the same file:

To serve files on extensionless URLs:

1. Go to *Site Settings* / *Routing*
2. Enable **Serve Extensionless URLs** and optionally **Force Extensionless URLs**
3. Click **Update Hosting Details**

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  **Serve Extensionless URLs** is on by default for new sites.
</comp.Notice>

Enabling **Force Extensionless URLs** redirects URLs with `html`, `htm` or `xml` extensions to extensionless versions. This ensures a single URL rather than serving the same file on two different URLs.
