Adding a Digital Asset Manager (DAM) to your site enables you to store your images and other assets in an external service, separate from your content. DAMs improve site build times and allow you to reuse the same assets across different sites. With Azure Blob Storage and Azure CDN, you can host your own DAM while still managing your files directly from CloudCannon.

You will need an Azure account to use Blob Storage.

### Connecting your DAM to CloudCannon
Open your site settings in CloudCannon. Navigate to *Files* */* *Assets*. Under *Link DAM*, select **New DAM**.

Choose **Azure Blob Storage** as your DAM type and enter a name - this will be used to identify your DAM in CloudCannon.

Set *Base URL* to the domain name of your Azure CDN distribution or, if you chose to configure them, one of its alternate domain names.

Set *Container name* to the name of your container on Azure storage.

Enter your *Storage account name* and *Access key*.

Click **Authenticate**, to save and close the modal, then click **Link DAM**.
