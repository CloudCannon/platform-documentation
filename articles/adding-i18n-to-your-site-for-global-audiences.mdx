Make your website more accessible to an international audience. i18n is an abbreviation for the word internationalization. It can be broken down to the following:

1. **i** (the first letter of the word)
2. **18** characters
3. **n** (the last letter of the word)

This is a form of abbreviation known as a [Numeronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym). Globalization (G11n) is sometimes used interchangeably with i18n.

Internationalization (i18n) on CloudCannon allows you to translate your site into different languages.

You can enable Internationalization in *Site Settings* / *i18n*.

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/i18n-enable-i18n.png" alt="I am an alt text" type="screenshot" />

## Tagging content for translation
First we must add a key to each element we want internationalised. To do this add a `data-i18n` attribute with a unique key.

For example:

<comp.CodeBlock language="html" source="index.html">
```
<h2 class="editable" data-i18n="welcome_message">Hello, welcome to my website</h2>
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

## Obtaining the current locale
Once you have tagged the elements that need translation, CloudCannon can generate a lookup of the content. CloudCannon supports three file extensions: `.json`, `.yml` and `.properties`. These files are called locales.

To obtain the current locale, you can visit any of these URLs on your site:

* `/cms-current-locale.properties`

  ```plaintext
  welcome_message = Hello, welcome to my website
  ```
* `/cms-current-locale.json`

  ```json
  {"welcome_message": "Hello, welcome to my website"}
  ```
* `/cms-current-locale.yml`

  ```yaml
  welcome_message: "Hello, welcome to my website"
  ```

## Providing alternative locales
Once you have the current locale, you can start creating new ones.

For each new locale:

1. Create the file with your chosen format (either `.yml`, `.json` or `.properties`).
2. Name that file the locale that matches it. This locale should be a in the format `language[_territory]`. For example, general English is `en` and English specific to New Zealand should be `en_NZ`.
3. Use the current locale as a template and update the values for the new locale.
4. Add each file to the `_locales` directory in the root of your site.

Here are some example locales:

* `/_locales/de.properties`

  ```plaintext
  welcome_message = Hallo, herzlich willkommen auf meiner Webseite
  ```
* `/_locales/es.properties`

  ```plaintext
  welcome_message = Hola, bienvenido a mi p&aacute;gina web
  ```

CloudCannon generates a new version of the HTML per locale and routes visitors based on their `Accept-Language` header and country.

## Detecting the current locale
CloudCannon automatically injects the viewers locale into the HTML elements class as it is served.

If a site has `en_NZ` support and the viewer accepts that language it looks like:

<comp.CodeBlock language="html" source="index.html">
```
<html class="language-en_nz">
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Using CSS you can alter anything from font-size to text direction:

<comp.CodeBlock language="css" source="styles.css">
```
/* Arabic */
.language-ar .content {
  direction: rtl;
}
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Run some custom JavaScript based on language

<comp.CodeBlock language="javascript" source="script.js">
```
const htmlElement = document.documentElement;
const languageClass = htmlElement.className.match(/language-([^\s]+)\b/);

if (languageClass) {
  console.log(languageClass[1]);
} else {
  console.log('Using default locale');
}
```
</comp.CodeBlock>
