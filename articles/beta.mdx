## December 2023 Beta: Editing in CloudCannon

This Beta Release updated many of the workflows you might use in CloudCannon.

Editing in CloudCannon is now a collaborative experience, enabling your teams to create content together. We've improved how our editing interfaces look and function, how you review your team's changes before saving, and added badges to file cards to indicate changed files.

We've also introduced avatars to various places in the app so you can see who is editing in real-time.

### Using CloudCannon Beta

To use the CloudCannon Beta, you must switch your account to the Beta environment and enable Beta editing sessions on each site.

To protect your files during this Beta period, your team cannot edit your site in the Main and Beta environments simultaneously. You can switch between the Main and Beta environments as often as needed by toggling the Beta editing sessions *Flag* per site.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Switching your site between the Main and Beta environments will destroy your unsaved changes. Please save your changes before switching environments.
</comp.Notice>

To enter the CloudCannon Beta:

1. Log in to CloudCannon and open your *Site Dashboard*.

2. Click on your avatar in the bottom left of the app.

3. Select *Enter CloudCannon Beta* from the *Account Menu*.

4. CloudCannon will reload.

5. Click *<span class="notion-enable-hover">Enable CloudCannon Beta</span>* in the banner at the bottom of the app and again in the *<span class="notion-enable-hover">Opt in to Beta</span>* modal.

The Beta environment is now enabled on your site.

Any sites created in the Beta environment will automatically have the Beta editing flag enabled.

You can remove a site from the Beta by navigating to *Flags*, under *Site Settings*, and unselecting the checkbox for *Use editing sessions*. To return to the Main CloudCannon environment, click *Exit CloudCannon Beta* in the *Account Menu*.

### Beta Changelog

#### Appearance and functionality updates for all editing interfaces

* Multiple users can now participate in editing sessions. Users are either *Editing* or *Viewing* a file during an editing session. Only one person can edit a file at a time, while any number of people can view their edits live. You can switch between *Editing* and *Viewing* with the dropdown in the top right of the editing interface.

* While *Editing*, all the changes you make to your file are visible to the rest of your team. While *Viewing*, you can interact with the file in read-only mode.

* The avatars in the top right of the editing interface indicate who is currently *Editing* or *Viewing* a file.

* CloudCannon periodically updates as you make changes, so you can refresh your internet browser, change the editing interface, and switch who is editing your file without losing any content. The *Updating* icon in the top right indicates when CloudCannon has remembered your changes.

* Team members now edit in a shared editing environment. This prevents team members from unknowingly updating the same file at the same time, resulting in one person's changes being destroyed.

* You can now open newly created files in the Source Editor without the need to save your site.

#### Rich text editor overhaul

* Appearance and functionality updates to the rich text editor.

  * Updated icons in the WYSIWYG toolbar, improving clarity and consistency with other icons in CloudCannon.

* Improved reliability of Undo and Redo toolbar options and keyboard shortcuts.

* The Code tool has been split into `code_inline` and `code_block` toolbar options. Enabling `code` in your toolbar options under your global configuration file enables both toolbar options.

* Snippets inside text paragraphs now take up less space.

* Images in the rich text view now behave like Snippets.

* Better controls for tables in the rich text editor.

* Fixed an issue where undoing a Snippet in the rich text view incorrectly added HTML to the file.

* Fixed an issue where image Snippets would not display an image preview in some Hugo sites.

#### Added the *Editing help* modal to all editing interfaces

* The *Editing help* modal appears when you enter any editing interface for the first time. This modal covers key features of the editing interface.

* You can dismiss this modal at any time or return to it using the ⓘ icon in the top left of the app.

### Coming Next

There are a few features we are still working on. We look forward to delivering these to you before the end of the Beta period.
