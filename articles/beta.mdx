## September 2024 Live Configuration Beta

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  This Live Configuration Beta is currently available to [Enterprise plan](/pricing/) customers and members of our [Partner Program](/partner-program/). An Open Beta will be coming soon.
</comp.Notice>

This beta release updates many of the workflows you might use in CloudCannon. These updates stem from one major change: you no longer need to build your Site to use CloudCannon.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Building is still required for Visual Editing, page screenshots in Collection browsers, and your Test Domain.
</comp.Notice>

#### Live Data and Configuration Editing

You can update your Data and Configuration files and see how those changes affect CloudCannon live without waiting for a build. This means you can:

* Populate inputs with new Collection files before saving the file.
* Update your Input, Structure, and Schema configuration, and see those changes the next time you open a file in an editing interface.
  * (Note: CloudCannon applies a Schema to a file when first opened during an editing session. You will not see live changes from an updated Schema if a file is already open with unsaved changes.)

#### Headless Mode

If you need to build and host externally or use server-side functions, you can now use CloudCannon as your primary CMS.

Headless Mode disables builds on your Site without preventing you from committing content to your git repository. To streamline your experience in CloudCannon, we have updated the UI by limiting which *Site Settings* are available in Headless Mode.

#### Unified Configuration

Creating a Site in CloudCannon is now simpler. CloudCannon requires less information from you to set up your Site and uses the same configuration options regardless of SSG. Additionally, you can get to your *Site Dashboard* faster and manage your content before your first build.

Here's a quick overview of the process for creating new Sites with CloudCannon Unified Configuration:

1. Connect your repository or upload your local files.
2. CloudCannon syncs your content.
3. You arrive at your *Site Dashboard* without the need to build your Site or enter build configuration details.
4. If your Site does not include a CloudCannon configuration file, CloudCannon will suggest one for you based on the contents of your Site files. On the *Status* page, you can review and confirm your Collections and SSG.
5. You are now able to edit your content. Building is optional.
6. If you choose to build, CloudCannon will suggest command line options and environment variables for you based on your SSG and Site files.

For existing Sites, you can migrate to the Unified Configuration anytime. Migrating to Unified Configuration will make it easier to maintain your build configuration.

We have updated the UI for our onboarding flow and the *Status*, *Site Details*, and *Build configuration* pages to support these changes.
