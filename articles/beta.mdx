## September 2024 Live Configuration Beta

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  The Live Configuration Beta is currently available to [Enterprise plan](/pricing/) customers and members of our [Partners Program](/partner-program/). The Open Beta is coming soon.
</comp.Notice>

This beta release updates many of the workflows you might use in CloudCannon. These updates stem from one major change: you no longer need to build your Site to use CloudCannon.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Building is still required for Visual Editing, page screenshots in Collection browsers, and your Test Domain.
</comp.Notice>

#### Live Data and Configuration Editing

x

#### Headless Mode

We still believe that most content sites should be static â€” for efficiency in page speed, reduced compute time, and more efficient use of server resources. But if you need to create a website that you build and host externally, or that uses server-side functions, you can now use CloudCannon as your primary CMS.

Headless Mode disables builds on your Site, without preventing you from committing content to your git repository. To streamline the UI, we have updated which *Site Settings* are available in Headless Mode.

#### Unified Configuration

Creating a Site in CloudCannon in now a simpler process. CloudCannon requires less information from you to setup your Site and uses the same configuration options regardless of SSG. Additionally, you can get to your *Site Dashboard* faster, and manage your content before your first build.

For new Sites created on CloudCannon

\:

1. Connect your repository or upload your local files.
2. CloudCannon syncs your content.
3. You arrive at your *Site Dashboard* without the need to build your Site or enter build configuration details.
4. If your Site does not include a CloudCannon configuration file, it will generate one for you based on your Site files. You can review and confirm your Collections and SSG on the *Status* page.
5. You are now able to edit your content. Building is optional.
6. If you choose to build, CloudCannon will suggest command line options and environment variables for you based on your SSG and Site files.

For exisiting Sites, you can migrate to the Unified Configuration at any time. Migrating to Unified Configuration will make it easier for you to maintain your build configuration.

To support these changes, we have updated the UI for our onboarding flow, and the *Status*, *Site Details*, and *Build configuration* pages.
