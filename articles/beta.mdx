## September 2024 Onboarding Beta

This beta release updates many of the workflows you might use in CloudCannon.

Creating a Site in CloudCannon in now a simpler process.

&nbsp;

We've harmonized configuration options across all static site generators (and beyond), with the aim of simplifying your builds and reducing reliance on specific SSG configurations. The result? Fewer editing blockages due to failed builds and a much smoother overall experience. Youâ€™ll be able to opt in to our new unified configuration system for an enhanced experience:

* New site creation flow: Get to your site dashboard, start editing, and manage content faster than ever. Enjoy improved default configurations and fewer build restrictions.
* Streamlined headless mode: Take control of your build process or choose to go buildless for dynamic sites.

Choosing to build on CloudCannon will continue to give you access to existing features, including live Visual Editing, screenshots of your pages while browsing the app, and preview URLs.

As we release these updates, we'll provide a comprehensive migration guide for those wanting to opt in to unified configuration.
