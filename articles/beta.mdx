## December 2023 Beta: Editing in CloudCannon

This Beta Release updated many of the workflows you might use in CloudCannon.

Editing in CloudCannon is now a collaborative experience, enabling your teams to create content together. We've improved how our editing interfaces look and function, how you review your team's changes before saving, and added badges to file cards to indicate changed files.

We've also introduced avatars to various places in the app so you can see who is editing in real-time.

### Using CloudCannon Beta

To use the CloudCannon Beta, you must switch your account to the Beta environment and enable Beta editing sessions on each site.

To protect your files during this Beta period, your team cannot edit your site in the Main and Beta environments simultaneously. You can switch between the Main and Beta environments as often as needed by toggling the Beta editing sessions *Flag* per site.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Switching your site between the Main and Beta environments will destroy your unsaved changes. Please save your changes before switching environments.
</comp.Notice>

To enter the CloudCannon Beta:

1. Log in to CloudCannon and open your *Site Dashboard*.

2. Click on your avatar in the bottom left of the app.

3. Select *Enter CloudCannon Beta* from the *Account Menu*.

4. CloudCannon will reload.

5. Select \[\] in the banner at the bottom of the app.

The flag for this Beta release is now enabled on your site.

Alternatively, you can toggle the site flag by navigating to *Flags*, under *Site Settings*, and selecting the checkbox for *Use editing sessions*.

To return to the Main CloudCannon environment, click *Exit CloudCannon Beta* in the *Account Menu*.
