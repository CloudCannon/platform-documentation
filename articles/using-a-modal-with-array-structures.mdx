Sometimes the number of structures you add becomes far too many for a dropdown. A modal with search, tagging and bigger images is available for this situation. For this we set the `style` key to `modal` at the same level as our `values` array.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json", "toml"]} source="Configuration">
```
_structures:
  example:
    style: 'modal'
    values:
      - label: 'First'
        value: 
          name:
          description:
          image:
      - label: 'Second'
        value: 
          heading:
          subtext:
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>
