Web hosting is where, after a successful [build](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-site-build/), all your files are stored on a web server and made available to the public on the internet. You can host your Site through CloudCannon, or through an external service.

Hosting your website requires a Domain Name, which you can purchase from any Domain Registrar.

* **Domain Name** — The address used to access a website (e.g., [cloudcannon.com](https://cloudcannon.com/)).
* **Domain Registrar** — A third-party company that handles the reservation of domain names and assigns IP addresses to domain names. Most CloudCannon users purchase a domain name from a Registrar (e.g., [Cloudflare Registrar](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/products/registrar/), [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)).

The Domain Name of your website appears in the URL.

CloudCannon automatically assigns a free Domain Name to each Site which you can use to preview your Site content live and share to team members. However, most user also have a personal or business Domain Name which they connect to their Site. For more information, please read our documentation on [Testing Domains](/documentation/articles/testing-domain/) and [Custom Domains](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/).

Hosting your Site on CloudCannon might be right for you if you want to keep your hosting settings on the same platform you use to edit your content. If you choose to host your Site through CloudCannon, you can:

* Connect a [Custom Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/).
* Configure [CloudCannon DNS](/documentation/articles/configure-cloudcannon-dns) or [external DNS](/documentation/articles/configure-external-dns/).
* Add a [wildcard SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/https-support-for-your-sites-hosted-on-cloudcannon/) or a [custom SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/add-a-custom-ssl-certificate/).

You can also host your Site externally through another provider, without interrupting your ability to edit your content in CloudCannon.

  If you want to host your Site externally, you can also disable builds on CloudCannon. For more information, please read our documentation on [Headless Mode](/documentation/articles/what-is-headless-mode/).
