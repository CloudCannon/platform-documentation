Web hosting is where, after a successful [build](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-site-build/), all your files are stored on a web server and made available to the public on the internet. You can host your Site through CloudCannon, or through an external service.

Hosting

* **Domain** —
* **Domain Registrar** — A third-party company that handles the reservation of domain names and assigns IP addresses to domain names. Most CloudCannon users rent a domain name from a Registrar (i.e., [Cloudflare Registrar](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/products/registrar/), [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)).

CloudCannon automatically assigns each Site a free [Testing Domain](/documentation/articles/testing-domain/).

If you choose to host through CloudCannon, you can configure:

* Connect a [Custom Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/)
