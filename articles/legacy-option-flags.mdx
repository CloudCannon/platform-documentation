## Image size attributes default behaviour

Older versions of CloudCannon would automatically add size attributes (width, height, sizes) to the HTML for images uploaded in the [Content Editor](/documentation/articles/the-content-editor/) and [Editable Regions](/documentation/articles/define-editable-regions-in-your-html/). This flag sets this as the default behavior, and will be turned on for some *Sites* where these attributes must be added to rich text images by default.

In most cases, this flag will be turned off, meaning that the attributes will not be injected for any editing interface that does not have `image_size_attributes: true`.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  <p>We do not recommend turning this flag on. Please consider using the <code>image_size_attributes</code> key instead.</p>
</comp.Notice>

As an alternative to turning this flag on, you can use the `image_size_attributes: true` configuration option anywhere in the [Configuration Cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/) for the Content Editor, [Rich Text inputs](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-rich-text-input/#block-content), and Editable Regions. When `image_size_attributes` is `true`, CloudCannon will inject width and height attributes onto images added to rich text through the editor.

A benefit of enabling `image_size_attributes` is that Internet browsers can size `<img>` elements before loading CSS and images. This prevents "pop-in" where the webpage shifts around in front of the viewer as images are loaded and elements are resized. Additionally, these attributes are required for `srcset` to work correctly. Browsers assume that the width of an image is 100vw by default. If the image has a `srcset` but no explicit size attributes, it will appear full-width regardless of the `srcset`.

One notable disadvantage of `image_size_attributes` is that, depending on the Markdown engine used by your *Site*, Markdown-formatted images may need to be converted to HTML.

If adding size attributes to your images is not right for you, some simple CSS can ensure that your images are sized correctly on the page. Define a width for your images, then set `height` to `auto`. This will allow the browser to calculate the appropriate height for your image based on the width.

<comp.CodeBlock language="css" source="styles.css">
```

img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}

```
</comp.CodeBlock>

## Legacy Collections Value Key

When you use a select input to reference a collection item, the value saved in your front matter is determined by [options.value\_key](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-select-input/#value_key) configured for your input. If this option has not been configured, the value will fallback to look for one of several sensible keys to pull from, like "id" and "title".

This flag exists to provide legacy behaviour to sites created before 25 November 2021. If turned on, select inputs that reference collection items, and which do not have `options.value_key` configured, will save a combination of the collection item's path, slug and id.

**It is not recommended to turn this flag on.** Instead, configure `options.value_key` for any select inputs that reference collections on your site.

## Hide link to telephone on URL inputs

`hide_link_to_telephone` is a configuration option that can be set on [URL inputs](/documentation/articles/configure-a-url-input) to hide the option to link to a telephone number.

This flag sets the default behaviour, when `hide_link_to_telephone` is not explicitly configured. If this flag is turned on, the telephone option will be hidden for any URL input that does not explicitly have `hide_link_to_telephone` configured.
