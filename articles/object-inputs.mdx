An Object input lets your team members group other inputs. Object inputs can contain nested inputs, including other Objects and [Arrays](/documentation/articles/array-inputs/). There is no limit to how many layers of nested Objects you can create in CloudCannon. Grouping inputs under an Object is useful for organizing your data.

Additionally, you can create sets of different keys to populate an Object, allowing your team to choose from several predefined structures, or create their own as needed.

&nbsp;

For each input you can configure the input subtype, which structures are associated with the input, groups of nested inputs with headings and subheadings, the appearance of the preview card, and how CloudCannon handles empty values. For Mutable Objects you can configure which keys and structures are allowed, add comments and documentation links, and determine label formatting.

You can also use the [general configuration options](/documentation/articles/configure-your-inputs/#general-configuration-options) available for all inputs.

## Object

The Object input provides an user interface for nested keys. Object inputs appear as a [card](/documentation/articles/configure-your-card-previews/) in the Data Editor or sidebar of the Visual or Content Editor, previewing some of the content it contains.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/editing/inputs/object/2024-07/CloudCannon-Documentation-Object-Input-Closed.png" alt="" title="" type="ui-snippet"/>

When you click on the Object card, it will open to show the nested inputs within that Object. The *Back* button at the top of the input will return you to the parent input.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/editing/inputs/object/2024-07/CloudCannon-Documentation-Object-Input-Open.png" alt="" title="" type="ui-snippet"/>

You can configure an Object input using the `type` key with the value `object`. Define the `type` key under your input key name within `_inputs`. For more information, please read our documentation on [configuring your inputs](/documentation/articles/configure-your-inputs/).

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json", "JavaScript"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">

  For Object Inputs to function correctly, they must contain nested inputs. You can add nested inputs using the [Source Editor](/documentation/articles/the-source-editor/). Alternatively, you can use a structure or a mutable object with defined value types to allow team members to populate the Object.
</comp.Notice>

Once configured, the Object input will appear in the Data Editor or sidebar of the Visual or Content Editor when you add it to a data file or the front matter of a markup file.

Object inputs have the following options available:

<comp.DataReference>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="subtype" type_markdown="boolean">
    Changes how this is object input is displayed and interacted with. Defaults to `object`.

    If set to `object`, data entries appear as standard inputs, nested one layer deeper.

    If set to `mutable`, data entries within an object input can be added, renamed, removed and reordered. This also changes the appearance of the input, by listing entries as a sequential group with controls for adding, removing, renaming and reordering.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="structures" type_markdown="string or object">
    Provides data formats for value of this object. When choosing an item, team members are prompted to choose from [a number of values you have defined](/documentation/articles/create-a-structure/). Has no default.

    If set as an object, the structures value is used directly.

    If set as a string, the structures value is fetched from the [configuration cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/). This allows you to define `_structures` elsewhere and reference it from here.

    <comp.Notice info_type="info">

  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="groups" type_markdown="array of Group">
    Allows you to group the inputs inside this object together without changing the data structure.

    Groups are labelled with a heading and description. They can start collapsed or expanded (default). The inputs that belong to each group are referred to by key. Groups can only contain inputs inside this object.

    Ungrouped inputs are displayed after the groups by default, but you can reverse this with `place_groups_below`.

    * `icon` for the icon displayed next to the link. Must be a Material Icon name. Defaults to `auto_stories`.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="place_groups_below" type_markdown="boolean">
    Controls which order input groups and ungrouped inputs appear in. Defaults to `false`. Inputs are grouped with the `groups` options.

## Unconfigured Object inputs

x

---

Object inputs represent object data within the Data Editor. They are ideal for grouping related inputs, or hiding complicated or infrequently edited data.

By default, they appear as a button that opens a new level in the editor to the side, showing the inputs inside the object. This continues as you click into nested object inputs. Each object level has a back button to return to the parent scope.

Alternatively, object inputs can be configured to behave differently:

1. **Structured** object, a switchable button that can be set from one or more values. Configured with the `structures` option.
2. **Mutable** object, a list showing each entry. Each entry is shown as its own input, including nested objects. Configured with the `subtype` option.

## Examples

Here are a number of examples demonstrating how to use and configure object inputs.

### Object

Object inputs are shown for inputs configured with the type `object`, or for object data values.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json", "toml"]} source="Value convention">
```

seo:
  title: How to contact us
  image: /images/staff.png
  description: These are all the ways to contact us.

```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json", "toml"]} source="Input configuration">
```

seo:
  title: How to contact us
  image: /images/staff.png
  description: These are all the ways to contact us.
_inputs:
  seo:
    type: object

```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

In the Data Editor, this example appears as a button with a preview of the data inside:

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/object-link.png" alt="Screenshot of unopened object input field" title="" type="screenshot-snippet"/>

Clicking that button opens a new level in the editor showing the inputs for the entries inside the object:

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/object-open.png" alt="Screenshot of active Object input field" title="" type="screenshot-snippet"/>

### Object with configured preview

An object input with configuration to adjust which data is used to generate the preview on the button.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json"]} source="Input configuration">
```

seo:
  title: How to contact us
  image: /images/staff.png
  description: These are all the ways to contact us.
_inputs:
  seo:
    type: object
    options:
      preview:
        text:
          - key: description
        subtext:
          - key: title
          - No title
        image: false
        icon: travel_explore

```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

### Object with grouped inputs

An object input with configuration to group related inputs together, creating a more focused editing experience.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json"]} source="Input configuration">
```

title: About
description: Everything about us is explained right here.
image: /staff.png
slug: about-us
sitemap: true
components:
call_to_action: contact-us

_inputs:
  $:
    type: object
    options:
      place_groups_below: false
      groups:

          comment: Values for search engines to read
          inputs:
            - title
            - description
            - image
        - heading: Advanced
          collapsed: true
          inputs:
            - slug
            - sitemap

```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

### Structured object

An object input with controls to remove the value, and then replace it with one of two predefined values.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json", "toml"]} source="Input configuration">
```

```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  `structures` applies to the object, while `entries.structures` applies to the entries of an object.
</comp.Notice>

### Mutable object

An object with entries shown in a list, with controls to add, remove, rename, and reorder.

Adding a new entry clones the value from the previous entry, and prompts you to enter the new key. At least one entry must exist to clone from, otherwise this input is invalid. This input prevents you removing the last entry.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json", "toml"]} source="Input configuration">
```

    age: 34
_inputs:
  staff:
    type: object
    options:
      subtype: mutable

```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  `entries.allowed_keys` can be used in combination with subtypes and `entries.structures` to control both the keys and the values for this object.
</comp.Notice>

### Mutable object with subtype

An object with entries shown in a list, with controls to add, remove, rename, and reorder.

Adding a new entry creates an empty `time` input, and prompts you to enter the new key. This object can have no entries, since the type is configured for the entries. Object subtypes are configured using the `.*` selector.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json", "toml"]} source="Input configuration">
```

_inputs:
  timeline:
    type: object
    options:
      subtype: mutable
  timeline.*:
    type: time

```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

### Mutable object with set keys

An object with entries shown in a list, with controls to add, remove, rename, and reorder.

The keys available when adding new entries and renaming existing entries are limited to the `entries.allowed_keys` list. No entries can be added once all `entries.allowed_keys` are in use. Entries with keys not included in `entries.allowed_keys` can exist, but if removed/renamed, cannot be re-added.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json", "toml"]} source="Input configuration">

        allowed_keys:
          - main
          - footer
          - sidebar

```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

### Mutable object with set values

An object with entries shown in a list, with controls to add, remove, rename, and reorder.

When adding a new entry here, you are given the option of two predefined values: *Image* and *External Link*.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json", "toml"]} source="Input configuration">

### Mutable object with set keys and set values specific to keys

An object with entries shown in a list, with controls to add, remove, rename, and reorder.

When adding a new entry here, you are given the option of two predefined values: *Image* and *External Link*. The keys available when adding new entries and renaming existing entries are limited to the `entries.allowed_keys` list. No entries can be added once all `entries.allowed_keys` are in use. Entries with keys not included in `entries.allowed_keys` can exist, but if removed/renamed, cannot be re-added.
