Automatic builds are configured by creating a `_schedule.txt` file in your site. After building your site, CloudCannon will read your `_schedule.txt` file and automatically configure a build at the specified time. This is useful for future posts.

### Schedule file format


The `_schedule.txt` is a comma separated list of values. It contains three values, which are used to schedule a build and generate the management UI.


1. **Run date**: Defines the date and time your build will be scheduled for.
2. **Build name**: A label that will be shown in the Scheduled Builds UI in CloudCannon.
3. **Source filename**: Path to a source file. The UI will show a button linking to the editor for that file. This is useful if you're scheduling a build to publish a particular file.

For example:

<comp.CodeBlock language="plaintext" source="_schedule.txt">
```
2020-10-22T10:00:00+00:00,Publish Post,_posts/2020-10-22-because-of-the-internet.md
2020-11-22T10:00:00+00:00,Publish Post,_posts/2020-11-22-the-history-of-marketing.md
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

### Generating the schedule
For convenience, it's likely you'll want to generate `_schedule.txt` programmatically.



<comp.Conditional ssgs={["Jekyll"]}>
  For Jekyll sites we recommend using our plugin, [jekyll-cloudcannon-schedule](https://github.com/CloudCannon/jekyll-cloudcannon-schedule) to generate `_schedule.txt`. This will parse all posts set for the future and generate a build on that date.

  <comp.Notice info_type="info">
    If automatic builds are not working, try setting `â€“-future` in *Site Settings* / *Configuration*.
  </comp.Notice>

  [![Gem Status](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-cloudcannon-schedule.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-cloudcannon-schedule)

  Add the following to your `Gemfile`\:

  <comp.CodeBlock language="ruby" source="Gemfile">
  ```
  group :jekyll_plugins do
    gem 'jekyll-cloudcannon-schedule'
  end
  ```
  </comp.CodeBlock>

  Then add the following to your `_config.yml`\:

  <comp.CodeBlock language="yaml" source="_config.yml">
  ```
  plugins:
    - jekyll-cloudcannon-schedule
  ```
  </comp.CodeBlock>

  <comp.Notice info_type="info">
    For Jekyll versions before 3.5.0, use `gems` instead of `plugins`.
  </comp.Notice>
</comp.Conditional>



<comp.Conditional ssgs={["Hugo"]}>
  There are no automatic methods for generating a schedule file in Hugo. You will need to output the file from your own templating or build hook.
</comp.Conditional>



<comp.Conditional ssgs={["Eleventy"]}>
  There are no automatic methods for generating a schedule file in Eleventy. You will need to output the file from your own templating or build hook.
</comp.Conditional>



<comp.Conditional not_ssgs={["Jekyll", "Eleventy", "Hugo"]}>
  There are no automatic methods for generating a schedule file in other SSGs. You will need to output the file from your own templating or build hook.
</comp.Conditional>



### Viewing automatic builds
When `_schedule.txt` is correctly set up, your site will be built automatically at the specified times.

To view all available automatic builds:

1. Go to *Site Settings* / *Schedule*
2. Select the **Automatic** tab
3. Clicking **Update** will open the source filename in the content editor
