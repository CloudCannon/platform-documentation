<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If you're an existing Integromat user, see [here](/documentation/articles/integrating-your-forms-with-integromat/) for a guide on integrating with Integromat
</comp.Notice>

You can integrate your CloudCannon forms with your Make scenarios using webhooks and the Make Inbox target.

To create a Make webhook:

1. If you haven't already, create a Make account [here](https://www.make.com/en/register).
2. In the Make console, open the *Scenarios* menu from the sidebar and click the *Create a new scenario* button.
3. Add a *Webhooks* module and select *Custom webhook* as its type.
4. When prompted to select a webhook, click the *Add* button and create a new webhook.
5. After you've created your webhook, click the *Copy address to clipboard* button. You'll need this URL to create the Make target. If you need to refer back to this URL you can do so from the *Webhooks* menu in the sidebar.
6. Add any additional modules that you want, then save your scenario.

To create a Make target:

1. Navigate to the forms menu in your Organization settings, under *Hosting &gt; Forms.*
2. Open your Inbox settings by clicking the *Manage* button on the Inbox you want to connect to Make.
3. Open the *Add new target* menu, and set the *Type* to *Make.*
4. Set the *Target* to the webhook URL from your Make scenario, then click *Add Inbox target*.

Now if you submit to that Inbox, your scenario will run on the submission data.
