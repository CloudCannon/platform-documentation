CloudCannon serves a 404 page when it canâ€™t find a file on your site. Create your own 404 page to blend in with the rest of your site.

To create a custom 404 page:

1. Create a file called `404.html` at the root of your site
2. Add the content you want CloudCannon to serve

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Set the permalink of your page to /404.html if you are using Jekyll and non-default permalinks.
</comp.Notice>

To use different 404 pages for parts of your site, you can use the `404` status code in a [routing.json](/documentation/articles/configure-routing/) file.

For example, if we want a unique 404 page for blog posts, we might add a `/404-blog.html` page on our site. Your routing file can then be configured to use this:

<comp.CodeBlock language="json" source=".cloudcannon/routing.json">
```
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "from": "/blog/.*",
      "to": "/404-blog.html",
      "status": 404,
      "forced": false
    }
  ]
}
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

A `404` routing status will transparently proxy the original request. The URL will not change, and the contents of `/404-blog.html` will be returned.

Make sure to set `forced: false`, otherwise all requests that match the `from` regex will return a `404`, regardless of whether the requested file exists.
