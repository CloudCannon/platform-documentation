Adding a [team member](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-team-member/) to a [Permission Group](/documentation/articles/what-are-permission-groups/) will increase their permissions in your [Organization](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-organization/).

There are three ways to add a team member to a Permission Group. The best method to use will depend on whether you want to:

* Add multiple team members to multiple Permission Groups.
* Add a specific team member to multiple Permission Groups.
* Add multiple team members to a specific Permission Group.
