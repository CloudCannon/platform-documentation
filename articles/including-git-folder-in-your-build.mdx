By default, CloudCannon will not include your `.git` directory in the build process.

If your site relies on information from your `.git` folder, you can use the **Include Git Folder** option.

1. Navigate to *Site Settings* / *Build*.
2. Open the *Advanced Options* menu.
3. Check *Include Git Folder* option.
4. Click the *Update Configuration* button at the bottom of the page.
