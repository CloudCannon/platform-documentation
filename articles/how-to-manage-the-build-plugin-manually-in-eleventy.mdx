By default, CloudCannon injects the `eleventy-plugin-cloudcannon` package into your site. This keeps the plugin up to date and uses the latest templates to create the build information file.

If this is clashing with your build, you can manage this manually:

1. Navigate to *Site Settings* / *Build*
2. Check the box labelled **Manage eleventy-plugin-cloudcannon manually**.
3. Click **Update Configuration**

Install and usage instructions are available on the [repository page](https://github.com/CloudCannon/eleventy-plugin-cloudcannon). Make sure to copy the templates from the installed package in order to create the build information file:

<comp.CodeBlock language="bash" source="Command line">
```
cp -R node_modules/eleventy-plugin-cloudcannon/cloudcannon .
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  You should periodically check your plugin is up to date for bug fixes and new features.
</comp.Notice>
