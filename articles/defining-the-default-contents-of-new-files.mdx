When you create a file for a collection in CloudCannon, the initial contents and file extension are copied from a schema file configured for the collection.

**[Follow these steps to create and configure a schema](/documentation/articles/creating-collection-schemas/) for your collection.**

Here's an example schema file and the required configuration for a `posts` collection:

<comp.CodeBlock language="markdown" source="schemas/post.md">
```
---
title:
author:
image:
---
```
</comp.CodeBlock>


<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json", "javascript"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
```
collections_config:
  posts:
    schemas:
      default:
        path: schemas/post.md
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Without a schema, the contents of another content file in the collection is used instead. The extension is copied as-is, and the contents are copied with some inputs cleared.
</comp.Notice>

Creating a file from a schema adds a `_schema` field to the front matter or data to keep track of what schema the file was created from. Schemas also [keep data consistent](/documentation/articles/keeping-content-consistent-across-files-in-a-collection/) by updating the available inputs when editing existing files so it's important that this is set correctly.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  The `default` schema is used if this field does not exist. You can change the field from `_schema` with the `schema_key` option when [defining your collections](/documentation/articles/defining-your-collections/).
</comp.Notice>

<comp.CodeBlock language="markdown" source="content/posts/my-new-post.md">
```
---
_schema: default
title: My new post
author: /authors/jane
image: /images/posts/header.png
---
This is the content of my new post!
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Schemas are also used to manage and [keep data consistent](/documentation/articles/keeping-content-consistent-across-files-in-a-collection/) across files in a collection, as well as providing the default `add_options` for [creating new files](/documentation/articles/defining-more-ways-to-add-new-files/).
