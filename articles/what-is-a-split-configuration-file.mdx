Rather than have a single [CloudCannon Configuration File](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-cloudcannon-configuration-file/), you can split your configuration across multiple files. With a split *Configuration File*, you can organize your configuration more effectively, especially for larger sites or when working with shared configurations.

You can split the following configuration into dedicated *Configuration Files*:

* Collections (`_collection_config`)
* Schemas (`collections_config.*.schemas`)
* Inputs (`_inputs`
* Structures (`_structures`)
* Structure values
* Snippets
* Rich Text (`_editables`)

You will still have one main *Configuration File* (i.e., `cloudcannon.config.yml`) that uses `*_from_glob` keys to point at other *Configuration Files* on your *Site*.

For more information, please read our documentation on [best practices for split configuration](/documentation/articles/best-practice-for-split-configuration-files/) and [splitting your Configuration File](/documentation/articles/splitting-your-configuration-file/).

## Why split your *Configuration File*?

There are several reasons why splitting your CloudCannon configuration across multiple files might be right for your *Site*.

Splitting your configuration across multiple files allows you to keep related configurations in dedicated files (e.g., Input configuration in one file and Schema configuration in another). When updating your *Site,* you can navigate directly to the file you need, without going through a single long *Configuration File*.

Collaborating with your team is easier with split *Configuration Files*, as you can work on different parts of your *Site* configuration simultaneously.

Split *Configuration Files* also allow you to reduce configuration redundancy. For example, rather than defining a common Input under several *Collections*, you can reference a single Inputs *Configuration File* from each *Collection*.

## Examples

### Split your Collection and Schema configuration

&nbsp;

In this example, we have two *Collections*: Pages and Posts.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````

collections_config:
  pages:
    path: content
    icon: wysiwyg
  posts:
    path: content/posts
    icon: event
    schemas:
      default:
        path: .cloudcannon/schemas/posts-default.md
      news:
        path: .cloudcannon/schemas/posts-news.md
        _inputs:
          author:
            type: text

``````````
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

We can move each *Collection* into a dedicated *Configuration File*.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````

collections_config_from_glob:
  - '/.cloudcannon/*.cloudcannon.collections.yml'

``````````
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

&nbsp;

### Split your Input configuration into one or more files

Input configuration often takes up a significant amount of space in your *CloudCannon Configuration File*.

&nbsp;

This example shows how to split your `_inputs` and `_structures` into separate files.

* Globbed files can contain one or more entries for both objects (`_inputs`) and arrays (`_structures.*.values`)
* For clashing object entries, globbed files overwrite the base config, and globbed entries overwrite themselves in import order
* Array items do not overwrite as they are not keyed
* You can use negative glob patterns (starting with `!`) to exclude specific files
* You can mix globbed and inline configuration in the same file

Before

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````

_inputs:
  title:
    type: text
    options:
      max_length: 100
  url:
    type: url
    options:
      hide_link_to_file: true

``````````
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

After

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````

_inputs_from_glob:
  - '/.cloudcannon/*.cloudcannon.inputs.yml'

``````````
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source=".cloudcannon/title.cloudcannon.inputs.yml">
``````````

title:
  type: text
  options:
    max_length: 100

``````````
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>
