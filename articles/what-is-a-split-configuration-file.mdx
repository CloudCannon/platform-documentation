Rather than have a single [CloudCannon Configuration File](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-cloudcannon-configuration-file/), you can split your configuration across multiple files. With a split *Configuration File*, you can organize your configuration more effectively, especially for larger sites or when working with shared configurations.

You can split the following configuration into dedicated *Configuration Files*:

* Collections (`_collection_config`)
* Schemas (`collections_config.*.schemas`)
* Inputs (`_inputs`
* Structures (`_structures`)
* Structure values
* Snippets
* Rich Text (`_editables`)

## Why split your *Configuration File*?

There are several reasons why splitting your CloudCannon configuration across multiple files might be right for your *Site*.

Splitting your configuration across multiple files allows you to keep related configurations in dedicated files (e.g., Input configuration in one file and Schema configuration in another). When updating your *Site,* you can navigate directly to the file you need, without going through a single long *Configuration File*.

Collaborating with your team is easier with split *Configuration Files*, as you can work on different parts of your *Site* configuration simultaneously.

Split *Configuration Files* also allow you to reduce configuration redundancy. For example, rather than defining a common Input under several *Collections*, you can reference a single Inputs *Configuration File* from each *Collection*.

## How do split *Configuration Files* work?

You will still have one main *Configuration File* (i.e., `cloudcannon.config.yml`) that uses `*_from_glob` keys to point at other *Configuration Files* on your *Site*.

CloudCannon introduces new `*_from_glob` keys that allow you to specify glob patterns pointing to other configuration files. These files are loaded and merged with your main configuration.
