When you [build](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-site-build/) your *Site*, CloudCannon will run the build command appropriate for your Static Site Generator (SSG). Your SSG will build your source files into your output files. These output files are what your website visitors see on the Internet, with each file served on a unique output URL.

You can view your output files after each successful build using your [Testing Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-testing-domain/), or [Custom Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/) if you have one configured.

## How does CloudCannon use output files?

CloudCannon uses your *Site's* output files in two places within the app: as the interactive webpage preview in the *Visual Editor* and as the webpage screenshots on *File Cards* in the *Collection Browser*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser" alt="A screenshot of the Collection browser shows previews of several blog files, sort and view dropdowns, the collection filter, and the + Add button." title="The Collection Browser" type="screenshot"/>

To open the correct output file in the *Visual Editor* and show the correct screenshot on a *File Card*, CloudCannon needs to match the output files to the source files. However, most modern websites do not have a one-to-one relationship between source files and output files. For example, the output file for your "Home" page will be `index.html`, but the content for this file could be stored across multiple source files (e.g., one for navigation, another for the footer, and a third for page content).

The unique output URL for each file will depend on your SSG, but in general, it will follow the folder structure in your *Site* repository. A file called `our-new-feature.mdx` in the "Blog" folder is likely to have the output URL `/blog/our-new-feature`.

Your SSG will output each of your website files to a unique URL, allowing visitors to access your webpages on the Internet.

&nbsp;

Once your SSG has built your *Site*, CloudCannon will generate a webpage preview for each *Collection* item, and automatically match webpage previews with each file by determining the likely output URL for each file.

If CloudCannon did not determine the correct output URL for your *Collection*, you will not be able to edit your files using the Visual Editor or see screenshots in your *Collection Browser*. You can fix this issue by [updating the output URL](/documentation/articles/update-the-output-url-for-a-webpage-preview/) CloudCannon uses to match a webpage preview to a file.

If you don't want CloudCannon to generate webpage previews for a *Collection*, or if CloudCannon has incorrectly determined an output URL for a non-output *Collection*, you can [disable webpage previews for a Collection](/documentation/articles/disable-webpage-previews-for-a-collection/).

Your SSG has completed a successful \*Site\* build! During your build, CloudCannon generated a webpage preview for each \*Collection\* file and automatically matched each preview with the likely output URL.

&nbsp;

Whenever you complete a successful [Site build](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-site-build/), CloudCannon will automatically generate a webpage preview for every output file as it appears on the Internet.

CloudCannon uses your webpage previews for on-page editing in the [Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-visual-editor/), allowing you to make editing decisions in context with your live webpage.

Webpage previews are also used as screenshots for each *File Card* in the *Collection Browser* to help you visually identify your files in-app.
