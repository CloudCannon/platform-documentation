Uploading files through a web browser is a quick way to get a website live on CloudCannon.

When creating a new site:

1. Select **Upload a folder** or **Upload a zip file**
2. Click on **Select your folder** or **Select your zip file**
3. Click on **Sync Files**

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  CloudCannon supports any file type uploaded or synced from a storage provider. The maximum size per file is 25 MB.
</comp.Notice>

To upload files from the *File Browser*\:

1. Open the *Add Files* menu
2. Select **Upload files** or **Upload a folder**

Uploading a folder uploads all files inside the folder, rather than the folder itself.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Alternatively, drag and drop files into the File Browser.
</comp.Notice>

Each file uploads individually to CloudCannon through your web browser.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If your site is synced with a storage provider, CloudCannon will push the files there as well.
