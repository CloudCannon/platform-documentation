<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Managing your SSL certificate on CloudCannon requires you to host your Site through CloudCannon. If you are hosting your Site through an external service, please review their documentation on SSL certification.
</comp.Notice>

An SSL certificate (or a TLS certificate) is a periodically regenerated, digital certificate that supports your website's authenticity and enables encryption for greater security between your web server and the visitor's browser. SSL certification is important to:

* Prevent others from intercepting the information passing between the server and the browser.
* Help users distinguish between the real version of your website and any fake versions created by other people.
* Verify ownership of a website.

We recommend all websites edited on CloudCannon use an SSL certificate.

## HTTP vs HTTPS

HTTP, or the HyperText Transfer Protocol, is the primary method used by the internet to transfer information between a browser and a web server. The acronym HTTP appears at the beginning at the beginning of a website's URL.

Websites with a valid SSL certificate use HTTPS instead, where the "S" stands for Secure. This means it is very easy to visually determine if a website is using a secure protocol.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/hosting/what-is-web-hosting/2024-11/CloudCannon-Documentation-URL-Structure-Diagram.png" alt="A diagram of a URL shows labels for protocol, subdomain, domain, top-level domain, subdirectory, slug, and path." title="The structure of a URL" type="ui-snippet"/>

Most browsers will automatically warn users before they attempt to visit an unsecure website (i.e., HTTP instead of HTTPS). Depending on your browser, this can take the form of a white warning page where the user must explicitly choose to continue to the unsecure site.

Warnings about unsecure websites can lead to a higher user bounce-rate (where users immediately "bounce" off your site before seeing any of your content). This might be because users are security conscious or because they lose interest due to an inefficient experience.

You can avoid these issues by adding an SSL certificate to your Site to enable HTTPS.

## How do SSL certificates work?

SSL certificates contain the following details about your Site:

* **Domain Name** — The address used to access a website (e.g., [cloudcannon.com](https://cloudcannon.com/)).
* **Certificate expiration date** — The date a certificate expires. This is normally a year after it was generated.
* **Public key** — A string used to encrypt data, protecting communication channels from unauthorized access. Data can only be decrypted with the corresponding Private key.
* **Certificate Chain** — A sequence of certificates which links the SSL certificate for your Site to a trusted certificate authority, providing legitimacy to your SSL certificate.

SSL certificates also come with a private key, which is not shared with the user's browser.

* **Private key** — A string used to decrypt data.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Do not write down your Private key in a publicly accessible or unsecure place. If you think you the security of your Private key has been compromized, please generate a new SSL certificate.
</comp.Notice>

When a browser attempts to connect to your website, it uses a process called a *TLS handshake*. This process validates the identity of the web server, the domain of your website, and prevents unauthorized access to the data passing between the user and your website.

In simple terms, the *TLS handshake* includes the following steps:

1. The user's browser contacts the web server hosting your website, specifying what version of TLS the browser is using and a random string called a "Client Random".
2. The web server replies to the browser with the SSL certificate and a random string called a "Server Random".
3. The browser will verify the SSL certificate with the certificate authority that issued it, confirming the authenticity of the web server and the domain.
4. The browser contacts the web server again with a random string encrypted with the Public key from the SSL certificate.
5. The web server uses the corresponding Private key to decrypt the message.
6. If the web server and the user's browser agree on the strings for Client Random, Server Random, and the decrypted message, then the web server will allow the browser to access the website in an encrypted session.

This process only takes milliseconds to complete, so it will not affect the user's experience on your website.

SSL certificates last for about a year and should be renewed at yearly intervals to maintain your website's security. You can renew you SSL certificate more often, but most website do not require this level of security.

Depending on your browser, a padlock icon will appear near your URL once you add an SSL certificate to your website. You can click on this icon to review the publicly available certificate information.

## TLS Version

To configure an SSL certificate for your Site on CloudCannon, you must specify the minimum TLS version.

* **Minimum TLS Version** — The minimum version of TLS that a user's browser must have to be allowed to access your Site.

A higher TLS version is a stronger cryptographic standard, including fixes for known vulnerabilities in previous versions. On CloudCannon, the minimum TLS version you can use for your Site is 1.2, however 1.3 is available if you require it.

## Validation Method

To configure an SSL certificate for your Site on CloudCannon, you must specify the validation method.

* **Validation Method** — The method used by the Certificate Authority to authenticate you are the owner of your domain. This is sometimes called the DCV (Domain Control Validation\*)\* method.

An important role of Certificate Authority is to ensure that the person requesting an SSL certificate is authorized to use the domain they request it for. On CloudCannon, you can verify ownership of a domain using one of the following methods: *DNS TXT Record* or *HTTP/Automatic*.

If you select DNS TXT Record as your validation method, CloudCannon will provide you with text

## SSL certificate types

On CloudCannon, any Site with a [Custom Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/) can use a [wildcard SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/https-support-for-your-sites-hosted-on-cloudcannon/) or a [custom SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/add-a-custom-ssl-certificate/).

* **Wildcard SSL** — A certificate that protects a single domain and all its subdomains (e.g., example.com and its subdomains blog.example.com, support.example.com, app.example.com etc.).
* **Custom SSL** — A certificate you have generated using a trusted third-party service (e.g., GoDaddy, Google, AWS, Cloudflare). Most web hosting services also provide the option to generate custom SSL certificates.

CloudCannon offers free wildcard SSL certificates by default through ZeroSSL and Cloudflare. These certificates regenerate automatically every year so that your Site is never unsecure. For more information, please read our documentation on [adding a wildcard SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/https-support-for-your-sites-hosted-on-cloudcannon/).

You can also add a custom SSL certificate to your Site on CloudCannon. For more information, please read our documentation on [adding a custom SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/add-a-custom-ssl-certificate/).
