<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Managing your SSL certificate on CloudCannon requires you to host your Site through CloudCannon. If you are hosting your Site through an external service, please review their documentation on SSL certification.
</comp.Notice>

An SSL certificate (or a TLS certificate) is a periodically regenerated, digital certificate that authenticate your website's authenticity and enables encryption for greater security between your web server and the visitor's browser. SSL certification is important to:

* Prevent others from intercepting the information passing between the server and the browser.
* Help users distinguish between the real version of your website and any fake versions created by other people.
* Verify ownership of a website.

We recommend all websites edited on CloudCannon use an SSL certificate.

SSL certificates contain the following details about your Site:

* **Domain Name** — The address used to access a website (e.g., [cloudcannon.com](https://cloudcannon.com/)).
* **Certificate expiration date** — The date a certificate expires. This is normally a year after it was generated.
* Public key — A
* Certificate Chain — A
* The digital signature of the issuing certificate authority

SSL certificates also come with a private key, which is not shared.

* **Private key** — A The private key is not shared

## How do SSL certificates work?

In simple terms, when a browser attempts to connect to your website, it requires the web server to send a copy of the website's SSL certificate. After the browser has confirmed the authenticity of the certificate, the web server will allow the browser to access the website in an encrypted session. This process only takes milliseconds to complete, so it will not affect the user experience on your website.

At the beginning of every URL is the acronym HTTP, which stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. Adding an SSL certificate to your Site will change your URL from HTTP to HTTPS, where the "S" stands for Secure. Most browsers will warn users before they attempt to visit an unsecure website.

SSL certificates last for about a year and should be renewed at yearly intervals to maintain your website's security. You can renew you SSL certificate more often, but most website do not require this level of security.

## SSL certificate types

On CloudCannon, your site can use a [wildcard SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/https-support-for-your-sites-hosted-on-cloudcannon/) or a [custom SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/add-a-custom-ssl-certificate/).

* **Wildcard SSL** — A certificate that protects a single domain and all its subdomains (e.g., example.com and its subdomains blog.example.com, support.example.com, app.example.com etc.).
* **Custom SSL** —

CloudCannon offers free wildcard SSL certificates by default through ZeroSSL and Cloudflare. For more information, please read our documentation on [adding a wildcard SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/https-support-for-your-sites-hosted-on-cloudcannon/).
