Every Site on CloudCannon is assigned a free Testing Domain with the *.cloudvent.net* URL. Each Testing Domain uses a randomly generated adjective and noun separated by a hyphen (i.e., [grey-grouse.cloudvent.net](https://grey-grouse.cloudvent.net/) or [brave-submarine.cloudvent.net](https://brave-submarine.cloudvent.net/)).

A Testing Domain is useful for seeing your content live.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  To stop serving content on your Testing Domain, you can either [set a password](/documentation/articles/adding-password-authentication-to-your-site/) to prevent or contact our friendly [support team](/support/).
</comp.Notice>

By default, CloudCannon automatically de-indexes Testing Domains so that they do not appear in search engines. CloudCannon does this by serving a *robots.txt* file on all Testing Domains.
