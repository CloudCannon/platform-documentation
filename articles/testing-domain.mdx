Every Site on CloudCannon is assigned a free Testing Domain with the *.cloudvent.net* URL. Each Testing Domain uses a randomly generated adjective and noun separated by a hyphen (i.e., [grey-grouse.cloudvent.net](https://grey-grouse.cloudvent.net/) or [brave-submarine.cloudvent.net](https://brave-submarine.cloudvent.net/)).

A Testing Domain is useful for seeing your content live after a successful [Site build](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-site-build/). If you use a [publishing workflow](/documentation/guides/staging-workflow-guide/), your Testing Domain will allow you to see the content for each branch on its own domain.

You can open your Testing Domain any time after a successful build by clicking on the *Live Site Preview* button in your [*Site Navigation*](/documentation/articles/configure-your-site-navigation/). The button will take you to the home page of your Site on your Testing Domain.

You can also open specific pages on your Testing Domain from any output file by clicking on the *Preview Live Site here* option in the *Context menu* in an editing interface or *Collection browser*.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  To stop serving content on your Testing Domain, you can [set a password](/documentation/articles/adding-password-authentication-to-your-site/) to prevent unauthorized visitors, enable [Headless Mode](/documentation/articles/what-is-headless-mode/), or contact our friendly [support team](/support/).
</comp.Notice>

You can use your CloudCannon Testing Domain as your primary domain; however, we don't recommend doing this for two reasons.

One, you cannot change the automatically generated domain name without creating a new Site on CloudCannon. The automatically generated domain may not be right for you or your Site. You can generate a new one by creating a new Site with the same files, but this can be inefficient.

Two, by default, CloudCannon automatically de-indexes Testing Domains so that they do not appear in search engines. CloudCannon does this by serving a *robots.txt* file on all Testing Domains.
