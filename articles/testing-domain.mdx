Every Site on CloudCannon is assigned a free Testing Domain with the *.cloudvent.net* URL. Each Testing Domain uses a randomly generated adjective and noun separated by a hyphen (i.e., [grey-grouse.cloudvent.net](https://grey-grouse.cloudvent.net/) or [brave-submarine.cloudvent.net](https://brave-submarine.cloudvent.net/)).

A Testing Domain is useful for seeing your content live after you have a successful [Site build](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-site-build/).

You can open your Testing Domain any time after a successful build by clicking on the *Live Site preview* button in your [*Site Navigation*](/documentation/articles/configure-your-site-navigation/). The button will take you to the home page of your Site on your Testing Domain.

You can also open specific pages on your Testing Domain from any output file by clicking on the *Preview live Site here* option in the *Context menu* in an editing interface or *Collection browser*.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  To stop serving content on your Testing Domain, you can either [set a password](/documentation/articles/adding-password-authentication-to-your-site/) to prevent or contact our friendly [support team](/support/).
</comp.Notice>

By default, CloudCannon automatically de-indexes Testing Domains so that they do not appear in search engines. CloudCannon does this by serving a *robots.txt* file on all Testing Domains.
