Site Mounting makes one site dependent on one or more other CloudCannon sites. Files from a remote site will be accessible to the local site at build time, and any updates to the remote site will trigger a build of the local site.

* **Local Site** — The recipient of files from another site.
* **Remote Site(s)** — The donor site.

You can have several remote sites mounted to one local site at a time. You can also mount one site to several other sites to create a content lake or common component hub. The number of connections per site and total number of mounted sites per Organization depends on your CloudCannon Plan.

* **Standard** — 4 site mounts and 5 mounts per site.
* **Team** — 50 site mounts and 5 mounts per site.
* **Enterprise** — 500 site mounts and unlimited mounts per site.

  CloudCannon will prompt you to reduce your total site mountings before you can alter your pricing plan to one with a lower maximum limit.

Site Mounting is an alternative to relying on Git sub-modules, build hooks, or custom APIs to manage your site dependencies. You can use Site Mounting to:

* Share components across multiple sites from a single source.
* Aggregate content from multiple sites into a single content lake.
* Set up a pre-generated headless API without GraphQL.

If you are on our&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/pricing/">Team and Enterprise plan</a>, Site Mounting also unlocks the ability to mount the build output of a site in addition to its source files.

## Mount a new site

You can customize your settings on the *Site Mountings* page.

* **Remote artifact** — This determines which files are mounted and which events trigger new builds. You can set this to either *Source files* or *Build output* (available on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloudcannon.com/pricing/">Team and Enterprise plans</a>).
* **Remote path** — This determines the path/folder mounted to this site from the remote site. Leave this blank to mount the entire site's files.
* **Local path** — This determines where CloudCannon will mount the remote files. This cannot be left blank.

To mount a site:

1. Open the local site.
2. Navigate to *Site Mountings* under *Site Settings*.
3. Select your *Remote Site*. This site must be within the same Organization as the Local Site.
4. Select your *Remote artifact*, *Remote path*, and *Local path*.
5. Click the *Mount site* button.
6. CloudCannon will add the site to your Sites mounted list.
