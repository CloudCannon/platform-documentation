Site Mounting makes one site dependent on one or more other CloudCannon sites. Files from a remote site will be accessible to the local site at build time, and any updates to the remote site will trigger a build of the local site.

* **Local Site**&nbsp;— The recipient of files from another site.
* **Remote Site(s)**&nbsp;— The donor site.

You can have several remote sites mounted to one local at a time. The number of mounted sites depends on your CloudCannon Plan.

## Mount a new site

You can customize your settings on the&nbsp;*Site Mountings*&nbsp;page.

* **Remote artifact**&nbsp;— This determines which files are mounted and which events trigger new builds. You can set this to either Source Files or Build output (available on Team plan and higher).
* **Remote path**&nbsp;— This determines the path/folder mounted to this site from the remote site. Leave this blank to mount the entire site's files.
* **Local path**&nbsp;— This determines where CloudCannon will mount the remote files. This cannot be left blank.

To mount a site:

1. Open the local site.
2. Navigate to&nbsp;*Site Mountings*&nbsp;under&nbsp;*Site Settings*.
3. Select your&nbsp;*Remote Site*. This site must be within the same organization as the Local Site.
4. Select your&nbsp;*Remote artifact*,&nbsp;*Remote path*, and&nbsp;*Local path*.
5. Click the&nbsp;*Mount site*&nbsp;button.
6. CloudCannon will add the site to your Sites mounted list.
