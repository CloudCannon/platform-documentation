Team members are people you have invited to your [Organization](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-organization/). Rely on your team members to help you edit and review your content, maintain your Sites, and manage your Organization. Each team member has their own CloudCannon account and a history of all the changes they have made to your Sites. When you invite a team member to your Organization, CloudCannon will ask you to assign them to a Permission Group.

Permissions control what actions your team members can perform within your Organization. The permissions of each team member are determined by which [Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-permission-groups/) they belong to. Each Permission Group contains a set of permissions which apply to all the members of that Group. Every team member in your Organization must be a member of at least one Permission Group.

The maximum number of team members allowed per Organization will depend on your [pricing plan](/pricing/). If you need to exceed this number, you can pay to add extra users to your Organization.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If you want to give someone permission to access an individual Site without making them a member of your Organization, you can use Site Sharing or Client Sharing. For more information, read our documentation on [Site Sharing](/documentation/articles/share-a-site-with-site-sharing/) and [Client Sharing](/documentation/articles/share-a-site-with-client-sharing/).
