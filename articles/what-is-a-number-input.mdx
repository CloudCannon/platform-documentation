A Number input is an editing interface for numeric values. You can use this input in the Data Editor, Content Editor, or Visual Editor to edit structured data in data files or front matter.

There are two types of Number input:

* Number
* Range

## Number input types

### Number

The Number input provides an editing interface for numeric values.

### Range

The Range input provides a slider interface for selecting a numeric value.

Depending on how your developer configured the input, your File input may have different options for uploading and browsing files. You can upload files directly to your repository or to a connected DAM.

### Input validation

Your File input may also have input validation, which requires the value to match predefined criteria before you can save your changes.

CloudCannon will show a red `*` next to the name of your File input if a value is required.

If you enter a file that exceeds the maximum file size limit, CloudCannon will display an error message in red text under the input field.

If your developer has configured a pattern for your input value (such as specific file extensions), CloudCannon will warn you when the value does not match the pattern. CloudCannon will show any error messages underneath the input field in red.

For more information, please read our developer documentation on [configuring a File input](/documentation/articles/configure-a-file-input/) for configuration options, valid input values, and unconfigured input behavior.

## Misconfigured File inputs

You will see an orange warning box if your File input is misconfigured.

File inputs are misconfigured if:

* The value is not a string.

For more information on how to fix a misconfigured File input, please read our developer documentation on [configuring a File input](/documentation/articles/configure-a-file-input/).
