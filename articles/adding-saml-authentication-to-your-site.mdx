Restrict access to your site by using a third-party login service.

CloudCannon uses SAML to authenticate visitors to your website using your organizationâ€™s identity provider.

To set up SAML account authentication for your site:

1. Go to the *Site Settings* / *Authentication* section
2. Select *SAML* and click **Switch to SAML authentication**

To configure SAML authentication:

1. Create a [CloudCannon Site App](https://www.onelogin.com/connector/cloudcannonsite-single-sign-on) in OneLogin (or generate credentials using your SSO provider of choice)
2. Copy your SSO details to the relevant fields in *Site Settings* / *Authentication* / *SAML*

Visitors to your site now need to authenticate as a member of your organization before viewing the site.
