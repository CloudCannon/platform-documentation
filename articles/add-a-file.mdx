Adding files in CloudCannon

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  When uploading files to CloudCannon, the maximum size per file is 50 MB. Files synced from a Git provider have no maximum size.
</comp.Notice>

## Create a new file from a Schema

A Schema is a file template. When using a Schema, CloudCannon will populate the file with contents that match the template. You can save multiple Schemas to create a library of file templates and configure the *\+ Add* button in your collection or file browser to list commonly used Schemas.

If a member of your team has configured a Schema...

To create a file using a Schema:

1. Navigate to the location you want to create the file using the collection or file browser.

2. Click the *\+ Add* button in the top right of the browser.

3. Select the Schema you want to use.

CloudCannon will open a new file using the Schema template in an editing interface and save it in the location open in the collection or file browser.

## Upload from the file browser

The file browser allows you to browse the files on your site using the same file structure as your Git repository. With this method, you can upload an individual file or a folder of files.

The file browser is not available to Editors or Clients.

To upload a file or folder from the file browser:

1. Navigate to the location where you want to upload the file in your file browser.

2. Click the *\+ Add* button in the top right of the browser and select *Upload files* or *Upload a folder*.

3. CloudCannon will open a local file browser. Select the file or folder you want to upload.

4. Review the files you want to upload in the *Confirm your files* modal.

5. Click the *Confirm selection* button.

CloudCannon will upload your file or folder.

Alternatively, you can also drag and drop files from your local computer into the CloudCannon file browser to upload them to the location you have open.

## Clone a file

You can add a new file to your site by cloning an existing file. This method is useful if you need files with similar contents. You can also clone a folder to create a copy of every file in that folder.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If you need many files with similar contents, we recommend setting up a Schema.
</comp.Notice>

To clone a file or folder:

1. Navigate to the item you want to clone in your collection or file browser.

2. Open the *Context menu* by clicking the icon in the top right of the file card.

3. Select *Clone item/folder*.

CloudCannon will clone your file or folder. Cloned files and folders will have “-copy” added to the file or folder name. Filenames inside cloned folders will not change.

If you are cloning an individual file, CloudCanon will open that file in an editing interface.

Alternatively, you can clone a file from the editing interface using the *File menu* in the top left corner.

## Upload from an editing interface

While in the Visual Editor, Content Editor, or Data Editor, you can upload files through a file input. Uploading from a file input is a convenient way to add files without leaving the editing interface. We recommend this method for uploading images or other file types that you want to include within another file.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Although you can upload videos this way, we recommend using an external link to prevent large files from affecting your Git repository.
</comp.Notice>

The file input allows you to select a file from your local computer or browse existing files stored in your repository or a remote DAM.

To upload a file to your root directory:

1. Navigate to the file you want to add another file to in your collection or file browser.

2. Open that file in the Visual, Content, or Data Editor.

3. Click on the input where you want to upload your file in the sidebar or Data Editor and select *Upload a new file*.

4. If you have a DAM connected to your site, the *Choose your file destination* modal will prompt you to select either your DAM or *Site files*. Click *Confirm destination*. If you do not have a DAM, CloudCannon will upload your file to your *Site files*.

5. CloudCannon will open a local file browser. Select the file you want to upload.

CloudCannon will upload your file to the root directory and add the file to the input you selected.

<comp.DocsImage path="" alt="" title=""/>

Uploading a file to the root directory may not be ideal for some sites. You can choose where in your file structure to upload your file using the *Explore existing files* option.

To upload a file to another location in your file structure:

1. Navigate to the file you want to add another file to in your collection or file browser.

2. Open that file in the Visual, Content, or Data Editor.

3. Click on the input where you want to upload your file in the sidebar or Data Editor and select *Explore existing files*.

4. CloudCannon will open a file browser modal. If you have a DAM connected to your site, you can choose which location to browse using the *Select your source* dropdown.

5. Navigate to the location where you want to upload the file (you can create new folders using the *\+ Add* button in the top right of the modal).

6. Click the *\+ Add* button and select *Upload files*.

7. CloudCannon will open a local file browser. Select the file you want to upload.

8. Review the files you want to upload in the *Confirm your files* modal.

9. Click the *Confirm selection* button.

CloudCannon will upload your file. To add that file to the input in your editing interface, select the file and click the *Select file* button.
