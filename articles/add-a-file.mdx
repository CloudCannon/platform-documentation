There are multiple ways to add files in CloudCannon. When you add a file to your site and [save your changes](/documentation/articles/save-your-changes/), CloudCannon will push the new file to your Git repository. This way, technical and non-technical team members can contribute to your Git repository.

## Create a new file in the collection browser

You can create a new collection file using the *\+ Add* button in the top right of the collection browser. The [\+ Add dropdown](/documentation/articles/defining-more-ways-to-add-new-files/) shows a list of available [Schemas](/documentation/articles/creating-collection-schemas/) for this collection or a default file template if no Schemas are configured.

* **Schema** - A Schema is a preconfigured file template that will populate new files with matching front matter and contents. You can configure your *\+ Add* dropdown to list a library of Schemas for each collection.
* **Default file template** — If no Schemas are defined for a collection, CloudCannon will generate a default file template. The default template will copy the front matter (but not the contents) of the first alphabetical file in the collection. In the *\+ Add* dropdown, the default template will appear as “+ Add \[collection item\]”, for example, “+ Add Blog” for a collection named “Blog”.

To create a file in the collection browser:

1. Navigate to the location you want to create the file using the collection or file browser.
2. Click the *\+ Add* button in the top right of the browser.
3. Select the Schema or template you want to use.

CloudCannon will open a new file in an editing interface and save it to the location open in your collection browser.

## Upload from the file browser

Your file browser uses the same file structure as your Git repository. You can upload an individual file or a folder of files using the *\+ Add* button in the top right of the files browser. Uploading a folder uploads all files inside it rather than the folder itself.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  The file browser is not available to [Editors or Clients](/documentation/articles/managing-your-team-members/).
</comp.Notice>

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/editing/add-files/2023-Q4/CloudCannon-Documentation-File-Browser-Add.png" alt="A closeup of the File Browser shows the options to 'Upload files' and 'Upload a folder' in the Add dropdown." title="Upload a file to the File Browser" type="ui-snippet"/>

To upload a file or folder from the file browser:

1. Navigate to the location where you want to upload the file in your file browser.
2. Click the *\+ Add* button in the top right of the browser and select *Upload files* or *Upload a folder*.
3. CloudCannon will open a local file browser. Select the file or folder you want to upload.
4. Review the files you want to upload in the *Confirm your files* modal.
5. Click the *Confirm selection* button.

CloudCannon will upload your file or folder to the location open in your file browser.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  When uploading files to CloudCannon, the maximum size per file is 50 MB. Files synced from a Git provider have no maximum size.
</comp.Notice>

Alternatively, you can also drag and drop files from your local computer into the CloudCannon file browser to upload them to the location you have open.

## Clone a file

You can add a new file to your site by cloning an existing file. This method is useful if you need files with similar contents. You can also clone a folder to create a copy of every file in that folder.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If your workflow requires many files with similar contents, we recommend setting up a [Schema](/documentation/articles/creating-collection-schemas/).
</comp.Notice>

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/editing/collections/2023-Q4/CloudCannon-Documentation-File-Context-Menu.png" alt="A closeup of the Collection Browser shows the option to 'Clone item' in the file Context Menu." title="Clone item option in the Context Menu" type="ui-snippet"/>

To clone a file or folder:

1. Navigate to the item you want to clone in your collection or file browser.
2. Open the *Context menu* by clicking the icon in the top right of the file card.
3. Select *Clone item/folder*.

CloudCannon will clone your file or folder. Cloned files and folders will have “-copy” added to the file or folder name. Filenames inside cloned folders will not change.

If you are cloning an individual file, CloudCanon will open that file in an editing interface.

Alternatively, you can clone a file from the editing interface using the *File menu* in the top left corner.

## Upload from an editing interface

While in the [Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-visual-editor/), [Content Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-content-editor/), or [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-data-editor/), you can upload files through a file input. Uploading from a file input is a convenient way to add files without leaving the editing interface. We recommend this method for uploading images or other file types that you want to include within another file.

File inputs in the sidebar of the Visual or Content Editor, or in the Data Editor, allow you to select a file from your local computer or browse existing files stored in your repository or a remote DAM.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Although you can upload videos this way, we recommend using external storage to prevent large files from affecting the size of your Git repository.
</comp.Notice>

### Upload to the root directory from a file input

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/editing/add-files/2023-Q4/CloudCannon-Documentation-Upload-Image-Dropdown.png" alt="A closeup of the file input in the sidebar shows the options to 'Upload a new image' and 'Explore existing images' in the input dropdown." title="File input dropdown menu" type="ui-snippet"/>

To upload a file to your root directory:

1. Navigate to the file you want to add another file to in your collection or file browser.
2. Open that file in the Visual, Content, or Data Editor.
3. Click on the input where you want to upload your file in the sidebar or Data Editor and select *Upload a new file*.
4. If you have a DAM connected to your site, the *Choose your file destination* modal will prompt you to select either your DAM or *Site files*. Click *Confirm destination*. If you do not have a DAM, CloudCannon will upload your file to your *Site files*.
5. CloudCannon will open a local file browser. Select the file you want to upload.

CloudCannon will upload your file to the root directory and add the file to the input you selected.

### Upload to a folder from a file input

Uploading a file to the root directory may not be ideal for some sites. You can choose where in your file structure to upload your file by using the *Explore existing files* option.

To upload a file to a folder in your file structure:

1. Navigate to the file you want to add another file to in your collection or file browser.
2. Open that file in the Visual, Content, or Data Editor.
3. Click on the input where you want to upload your file in the sidebar or Data Editor and select *Explore existing files*.
4. CloudCannon will open a file browser modal. If you have a DAM connected to your site, you can choose which location to browse using the *Select your source* dropdown.
5. Navigate to the location where you want to upload the file (you can create new folders using the *\+ Add* button in the top right of the modal).
6. Click the *\+ Add* button and select *Upload files*.
7. CloudCannon will open a local file browser. Select the file you want to upload.
8. Review the files you want to upload in the *Confirm your files* modal.
