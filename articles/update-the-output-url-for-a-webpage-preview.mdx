<comp.Notice info_type="permissions">
  <p><strong>Permissions required</strong></p><p>Members of the Owners, Developers, and Technical Editors <a href="/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/">Default Permission Groups</a>, or <a href="/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/">Custom Permission Groups</a> with the <code>site:source-editor:write</code> and <code>site:file:write</code> permissions, can edit your <em>CloudCannon Configuration File</em>. You can limit permission to specific files using <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/#specify-a-file-glob">file globs</a>.</p>
</comp.Notice>

An [output URL](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-output-url/) is the URL your SSG outputs your files to during a [Site build](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-site-build/). CloudCannon automatically determines the output URL to which your SSG output each file to generate webpage previews for the [Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-visual-editor/) and screenshots in the *Collection Browser*.

If CloudCannon has incorrectly determined your output URL, you can specify the output URL for each *Collection* using a template string.

To update the output URL CloudCannon uses to match a webpage preview to a file:

1. Navigate to the *Collection* for which you want to generate webpage previews.
2. Turn on *Configuration Mode* using the switch on the right of the *Site Header*. Purple *Edit Configuration* buttons will appear in the *Collection Browser*.
3. Click the *Edit Advanced* in the top right of the *Collection Browser*. CloudCannon will open the *Edit Advanced* data panel.
4. Identify the *URL* text field and enter the template string for the correct output URL.
5. Save the change to your *Site*.

CloudCannon will automatically update the

  <p>Updating the <code>url</code> key does not change where your SSG will output your files or cause CloudCannon to regenerate webpage previews.</p>

## Template string placeholders

You can use placeholders as well as plain text in the template string of your output URL. CloudCannon will populate placeholders at build time. You can use fixed or data placeholders in output URL template strings and filters to modify the value of data placeholders, allowing you to use structured data from your files in the Collection.

### Fixed placeholders

The following fixed placeholders are available for your output URL template string:

* `[filename]` — Populated by the original filename including the file extension.
* `[slug]` — Populated by the original filename excluding the file extension. If the filename is "index", this will result in an empty string.
* `[relative_path]` — Populated by the original file name including the file extension, relative to the *Collection* path.
* `[relative_base_path]` — Populated by the original file name excluding the file extension, relative to the *Collection* path.
* `[full_slug]` — An alias for the template path `[relative_base_path]/[slug]`.
* `[path]` — Populated by the original file name including the file extension, relative to your *Site* source.
* `[base_path]` — Populated by the original file name excluding the file extension, relative to your *Site* source.
* `[collection]` — Populated by the key for the *Collection* to which the file belongs.
* `[ext]` — Populated by the last file extension in the original file path.

### Data placeholders

You can reference any front matter field from your file in your output URL template string by using the key name in curly brackets (e.g., `{key}`).

You can also apply filters to your data placeholders using the `|` character after your front matter key name and then the name of the filter.

For a complete list of filters are available for data placeholders in your output URL template string, please read our documentation on [template strings](/documentation/articles/configure-your-template-strings/).
