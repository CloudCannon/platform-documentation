CloudCannon serves a 404 page when it canâ€™t find a file on your site. Create your own 404 page to blend in with the rest of your site.

To create a custom 404 page:

1. Create a file called `404.html` at the root of your site
2. Add the content you want CloudCannon to serve

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Set the permalink of your page to /404.html if you are using Jekyll and non-default permalinks.
</comp.Notice>
