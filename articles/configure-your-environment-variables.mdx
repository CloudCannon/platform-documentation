<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If you have yet to [configure your first Site build](/documentation/articles/configure-your-first-build/), CloudCannon will suggest environment variables for you based on your SSG and the contents of your Site files.
</comp.Notice>

Environment variables may be required for your site to build correctly. For example, Jekyll sites may want to set the `JEKYLL_ENV` environment variable to `production` when hosting a live site.
Environment variables can also be used to change behavior for different deployment targets. For example, you might use a different CDN for your development, staging and production sites.

To configure your environment variables:

1. Navigate to the *Build configuration* page under *Site Settings*.
2. Under *Command line options*, enter the *Key* and *Value* for your *Environment Variables*.
3. Click the *Add Environment Variable* button to add more text fields as needed.
4. Click the *Update Site* button.

Environment variables are often used in conjunction with command line options. For more information, please read our documentation on [configuring your command line options](/documentation/articles/configure-your-command-line-options/).
