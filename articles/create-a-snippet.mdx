## What is a snippet?

A snippet is a component that supplements your Markdown content. Snippets are great for building an interactive page editing experience without touching the underlying code.

A snippet can be many things: a wrapper to contain shortcodes or templating language, a GUI that allows you to edit HTML parameters but not the code, or a way to represent code that cannot be represented in a rich text editor. Although snippets can accomplish a variety of tasks, all snippets consist of three parts:

* Code in the Source Editor
* A preview card in the rich text editor
* A data panel for editing the values of your snippet

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  We recommend using snippets to create custom styles in your Markdown rather than [adding custom markup](/documentation/articles/best-practices-for-rich-text/).
</comp.Notice>

Once you have configured your snippets, your team members can easily add them to any Markdown content by clicking the *Insert snippet* button in the *WYSIWYG toolbar* and selecting from the searchable pop-up modal.

By clicking on the snippet you can open the *Snippet data panel*, which allows you to change the parameters of the snippet. The data panel provides an easy-to-use interface so non-technical content creators never need to interact with your code.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  You can insert snippets in any rich text editor. This includes the Content Editor and rich text inputs. As snippets can contain rich text inputs, you can even insert a snippet inside of a snippet!
</comp.Notice>

### Select a snippet type

CloudCannon supports the following snippet templates:

* [Docusaurus Components](/documentation/articles/snippets-using-docusaurus-components)
* [Eleventy Shortcodes](/documentation/articles/snippets-using-eleventy-shortcodes/)
* [Hugo Shortcodes](/documentation/articles/snippets-using-hugo-shortcodes/)
* [MDX Components](/documentation/articles/snippets-using-mdx-components/)
* [Python Markdown](/documentation/articles/snippets-using-python-markdown/)

### Enabling the snippet button in the WYSIWYG toolbar

By default, CloudCannon will show the *Insert snippet* button in the *WYSIWYG toolbar* if you have at least one snippet. The *WYSIWYG toolbar* appears in the [Content Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-content-editor/) and in [rich text inputs](/documentation/articles/using-rich-text-inputs-to-edit-your-data/).

However, if you have already [customized which options are available](/documentation/articles/configuring-toolbars/) in your *WYSIWYG toolbar* using the `_editables`key in your [global configuration file](/documentation/articles/create-a-global-configuration-file/), you will need to ensure that `snippet: true` is included.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json", "JavaScript"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````
_editables:
  content:
    snippet: true
``````````
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>
