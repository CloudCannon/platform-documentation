<comp.Notice info_type="permissions">
  **Permissions required**

  Members of the Owners [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/), or [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/) with the `base-domain:delete:write` permission, can disconnect Custom Domains from an Organization.
</comp.Notice>

A Custom Domain is a unique address used to identify a website (e.g., [cloudcannon.com](https://cloudcannon.com/)). If you have [connected a Custom Domain to your Organization](/documentation/articles/connect-a-custom-domain-to-your-organization/) and [added the Custom Domain to your Site](/documentation/articles/add-a-custom-domain-to-your-site/), CloudCannon will host your website content at that web address.

Disconnecting a Custom Domain from your Organization will allow you to add the domain to a different CloudCannon Organization.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Disconnecting a Custom Domain from your CloudCannon Organization does not delete your domain, or affect any of the settings managed by your Domain Registrar.
</comp.Notice>

To protect you from accidentally taking your website down by disconnecting your Custom Domain, CloudCannon prevents you from disconnecting the domain from your Organization until you have removed it from all CloudCannon Sites.

These instructions assume you have already [removed the Custom Domain from all CloudCannon Sites](/documentation/articles/remove-a-custom-domain-from-your-site/).

To disconnect a Custom Domain from your Organization:

1. &nbsp;Log in to CloudCannon and select the Organization from which you want to disconnect the Custom Domain.
2. Click the *Domains* button in the *App Sidebar*. CloudCannon will open the *Domains browser*.
3. Identify the domain you want to disconnect and click on the *Domain* card. CloudCannon will open the *Domain* page for this Custom Domain.
4. Navigate to the *Danger* section under the *Domain Settings* tab.
5. Click the *Disconnect Domain* button, and click again to confirm.

CloudCannon will disconnect the Custom Domain from your Organization.
