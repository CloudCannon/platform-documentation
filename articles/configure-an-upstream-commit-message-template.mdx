[Updating from a Publish Branch](/documentation/articles/update-from-a-publish-branch/) will merge upstream changes with a merge commit or pull request. You can configure a commit message for these merges in your [CloudCannon configuration file](https://crawling-ginger.cloudvent.net/documentation/articles/create-your-cloudcannon-configuration-file/). Configuring a commit message will help you to maintain a consistent format.

Upstream commit messages use [template strings](https://crawling-ginger.cloudvent.net/documentation/articles/configure-your-template-strings/). To add an upstream commit template, add the key `upstream_commit_template` to the root level of your global configuration file.

Your `upstream_commit_template` should look something like this:

<comp.CodeBlock language="YAML" source="/cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````

upstream_commit_template: "Merge branch [publish_branch] into develop of [branch] by [author] at [date]"

``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

An upstream commit message template can contain plain text and placeholders. Placeholders insert data related to the commit and use `[ ]` brackets. CloudCannon supports the following commit placeholders:

* `[branch]` — the name of the current branch.
* `[publish_branch]` — the name of the Publish Branch from which you merge upstream changes.
* `[author]` — the email address of the person responsible for the upstream merge.
* `[date]` — the date of the upstream merge in the format "Tue Nov 28 2023 21:46:17 GMT+0000".
