<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  To merge your changes, you first need a publish branch to merge into. Read more about [adding a publish branch](/documentation/articles/setting-up-a-publish-branch-with-merging-or-pull-requests/#adding-a-publish-branch), or [creating a project](/documentation/articles/enabling-editor-branching-with-projects/#adding-a-new-project).
</comp.Notice>

## Merging
Merging is a straight-forward way to push changes back to your publish branch.

The workflow for merging is as follows:

1. Make changes to the branched site
2. In your site's settings, navigate to **Publishing** tab
3. Click the **Publish** button.

## Pull Requests
Pull requests provide an intermediate step for publishing.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Any pull requests that are not from the connected branch to publish branch are hidden in CloudCannon.
</comp.Notice>

The workflow with this publish mode is:

1. Make changes to the branched site
2. In your site's settings, navigate to the **Publishing** tab
3. Edit the title and description of the pull request to provide context to the reviewer.
4. Click **Create Pull Request**

### Reviewing pull requests
Once a pull request has been made, you (or another editor) can then review it before merging.

1. In your site's settings, navigate to the **Publishing** tab
2. Review the changes
3. Click **Merge** *or* **Close**

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  **Merge** publishes the changes into the publish branch, while **Close** cancels the pull request. Changes made are retained after closing a pull request.
</comp.Notice>
