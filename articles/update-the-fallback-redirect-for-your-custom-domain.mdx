<comp.Notice info_type="permissions">
  **Permissions required**

  Members of the Developers and Owners [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/), or [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/) with the `base-domain:settings:details:write` permission, can update the fallback redirect for a Custom Domain.
</comp.Notice>

A Custom Domain is a unique address used to identify a website (e.g., [cloudcannon.com](https://cloudcannon.com/?__hstc=242898397.3f79da87b45b1506cc1bcb94d46532f9.1745964550347.1746147815623.1746151999720.15&amp;__hssc=242898397.7.1746151999720&amp;__hsfp=4148913854)). If you have <a href="/documentation/articles/connect-a-custom-domain-to-your-organization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connected a Custom Domain to your Organization</a>, you can host your Site on a subdomain by [adding a Custom Domain to your Site](/documentation/articles/add-a-custom-domain-to-your-site/). CloudCannon will use the fallback redirect domain for any subdomains you do not add to a CloudCannon Site.

* &nbsp;**Fallback redirect** â€” The domain to which CloudCannon will redirect visitors when they attempt to access an unconfigured subdomain.

The fallback redirect prevents your visitors from encountering 404 errors if they enter an incorrect domain name in their Internet browser. By default, CloudCannon will use your base domain as your fallback redirect (e.g., \*.example.com will redirect to example.com).

You can configure which domain or subdomain is your fallback redirect on the *Network* tab of your Custom Domain's *Domain* page. To select a Custom Domain as your fallback redirect, you must add that domain to a CloudCannon Site.

These instructions assume you have connected the Custom Domain to your Organization and added the domain you want to use as your fallback redirect to a Site.

To configure your fallback redirect:

1. Log in to CloudCannon and select the Organization with the Custom Domain you want to update.
2. Click the *Domains* button in the *App Sidebar*. CloudCannon will open the *Domains browser*.
3. Identify the domain you want to update and click on the *Domain* card. CloudCannon will open the *Domain* page for this Custom Domain.
4. On the *Network* tab, click the *Update fallback redirect* button under the *Fallback redirect* heading. CloudCannon will open the *Update your fallback redirect* modal.
5. &nbsp;Select the subdomain you want to use as your fallback redirect using the *Subdomain* dropdown.
6. Click the *Update fallback redirect* button.

CloudCannon will update you fallback redirect.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  If you have configured your [DNS](/documentation/articles/what-is-dns/) to point a specific domain at a service outside of CloudCannon, CloudCannon will not be able to redirect that domain to your main domain.
