[Web hosting](/documentation/articles/what-is-web-hosting/) is the process of storing your website files on a web server and making them available to the public on the Internet. External hosting is when you choose to edit your files through CloudCannon, but host your website through a third-party service.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Hosting on CloudCannon is optional. You can continue to use CloudCannon as your primary CMS while hosting through a third-party service.
</comp.Notice>

You may want to host externally if:

* You are migrating to CloudCannon and already have hosting infrastructure.
* Your company's security policies require you to host with an internally approved service.
* You have custom [build](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-site-build/) requirements, such as for a fully hosted static website with visual editing, server-side rendering (SSR) or other server-side functions, or use CloudCannon in [Headless Mode](/documentation/articles/what-is-headless-mode/).

You can use CloudCannon to edit and build your Site, then deploy the built files to a second Git repository. You can use this second repository to host your Site with an external service. For more information, please read our documentation on [configuring build deploys](/documentation/articles/configure-build-deploys/).
