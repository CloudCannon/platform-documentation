[Structures](/documentation/articles/create-a-structure/) are part of the CloudCannon [configuration cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/). You can configure them for your site as a whole and for a specific page or collection. You can define your structures in the following places:

1. [The global configuration file](/documentation/articles/create-a-global-configuration-file)
2. [Collection configuration](/documentation/articles/define-your-collections/)
3. [Schema configuration](/documentation/articles/create-a-schema)
4. File front matter
5. Within another [structure](/documentation/articles/create-a-structure/)

When you define a structure in multiple places, CloudCannon uses the highest priority source and does not merge the structures. For example, a structure defined in the front matter of a file will take priority over one defined in collections.

## Define a structure at the collection level

To configure for an individual collection, use the `_structures` key under your collection in `collections_config`.

Here is a structure configuration for the collection Blog:

<comp.CodeBlock language="YAML" source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
```
collections_config: #1
  blog: #2
    _structures: #3
      example: #4
        style: select
        values:
          - label: Product
            value:
              name:
              description:
              image:
```
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  The `collections_config` key contains all the collections and any configuration for those collections.
</comp.Annotation> <comp.Annotation number="2">
  The `blog` key matches out collection “Blog”.
</comp.Annotation> <comp.Annotation number="3">
  The `_structures` key contains all the structures defined at a given level of the configuration cascade. In this code, structures defined here will only be available inside the collection “blog”.
</comp.Annotation> <comp.Annotation number="4">
  The key name for our structure group is `example`. Under example we have defined a single structure labelled “Product” with the fields for `name`, `description`, and `image`.
</comp.Annotation></comp.CodeBlock>

The structures defined under the key `example` will only be available for array or object inputs in the collection "Blog".

## Define a structure within another structure

You can nest structures by defining a structure within another structure. These “sub-structures” will only affect arrays within the containing structure.

For this example, we want to create a page builder called `page_sections`. Within the structure for the `page_sections` array, let’s create an option for a hero, content, and call-to-action section. Then, within the option for `content`, let’s define a second structure for the array `elements`. The `elements` structure will have the options for text and image.

Here is our structure configuration:

<comp.CodeBlock language="YAML" source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
```
page_sections:[]

_inputs: #1
  content: #2
    type: array
    options:
      structures: _structures.elements #3

_structures: #4
  page_sections: #5
    values:
      - label: Hero
        icon: title
        value:
          _type: hero
          title:
          description:
      - label: Content #6
        icon: subject
        value:
          _type: content
          content: [] #7
        _inputs:
          content: []
        _structures: #8
          elements: #9
            values:
              - label: Text
                icon: article
                value:
                  content:
                _inputs:
                  content:
                    type: textarea
              - label: Image
                icon: image
                value:
                  image:
                  description:
      - label: Call to action
        icon: smart_button
        value:
          _type: cta
          url:
          content:
```
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  The `_inputs` key contains all the inputs defined at a given level of the configuration cascade.
</comp.Annotation> <comp.Annotation number="2">
  The key name of the array or object input which contains the sub-structure. In this code, we have called our input `content`.
</comp.Annotation> <comp.Annotation number="3">
  The `options.structures` key is set to `_structures.elements`, referencing the sub-structure named “elements”.
</comp.Annotation> <comp.Annotation number="4">
  The `_structures` key contains all the structures defined at a given level of the configuration cascade.
</comp.Annotation> <comp.Annotation number="5">
  The key name of your structure. In this code, we have called our structure `page_sections`.
</comp.Annotation> <comp.Annotation number="6">
  Under the key `page_sections` we have defined two structures. The second structure is labelled "Content".
</comp.Annotation> <comp.Annotation number="7">
  The Structure labelled "Content" contains an array named `elements`. We will populate this array with a structure
</comp.Annotation> <comp.Annotation number="8">
  Within the structure labelled "Content", we have defined another structure.
</comp.Annotation> <comp.Annotation number="9">
  The key name of your sub-structure. In this code, we have called our sub-structure `elements`. The structures defined under `elements` will only be available within the item "Content" where `page_sections` is used in an aray or object input.
</comp.Annotation></comp.CodeBlock>

Let’s populate the arrays for `page_sections` and `elements` with sample content to see this substructure in action. Here is how the arrays look in the sidebar of the Content Editor.
