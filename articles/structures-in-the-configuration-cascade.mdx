[Structures](/documentation/articles/create-a-structure/) are part of the CloudCannon [configuration cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/), so you can configure them for your site as a whole and for a specific page or collection. You can define your structures in the following places:

1. [The global configuration file](/documentation/articles/create-a-global-configuration-file)
2. [Collection configuration](/documentation/articles/define-your-collections/)
3. [Schema configuration](/documentation/articles/create-a-schema)
4. File front matter
5. Within another [structure](/documentation/articles/create-a-structure/)

When you define a structure in multiple places, CloudCannon uses the highest priority source and does not merge the structures. For example, a structure defined in the front matter of a file will take priority over one defined in collections.

## Define a structure at the collection level

To configure for an individual collection, use the `_structures` key under your collection in `collections_config`.

Here is a structure configuration for the collection Blog:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="">
```
collections_config:
  blog:
    _structures:
      example:
        style: select
        values:
          - label: Product
            value:
              name:
              description:
              image:
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

## Define a structure within another structure

You can nest structures by defining a structure within another structure. These “sub-structures” will only affect arrays within the containing structure.

For this example, we want to create a page builder called `page_sections`. Within the structure for the `page_sections` array, let’s create an option for a hero, content, and call-to-action section. Then, within the option for `content`, let’s define a second structure for the array `elements`. The `elements` structure will have the options for text and image.

Here is our structure configuration:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="Global Configuration File">
```
page_sections: []

_structures:
  page_sections:
    values:
      - label: Hero
        icon: title
        value:
          _type: hero
          title:
          description:
      - label: Content
        icon: subject
        value:
          _type: content
          elements: []
        _structures:
          elements:
            values:
              - label: Text
                icon: article
                value:
                  content:
              - label: Image
                icon: image
                value:
                  image:
                  description:
      - label: Call to action
        icon: smart_button
        value:
          _type: cta
          url:
          content:
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

Let’s populate the arrays for `page_sections` and `elements` with sample content to see this substructure in action. Here is how the arrays look in the sidebar of the Content Editor.
