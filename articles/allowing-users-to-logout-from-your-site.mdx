Once a user is authenticated, they can log out at `<your-domain>/logout`. You can provide a logout button on your authenticated pages with this link.

<comp.CodeBlock language="html" source="index.html">
```
<a href="/logout">Log out</a>
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

### Detecting if a user is logged in
CloudCannon sets a cookie when the user is authenticated. Use this to show the logout button for authenticated users on public pages, and hide it otherwise.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  No sensitive authentication data is exposed through cookies.
</comp.Notice>

The cookie is used to set a class on the body. The CSS will show the logout button with this class.

<comp.CodeBlock language="javascript" source="script.js">
```
var isAuthenticated = document.cookie.indexOf("authenticated=true") >= 0;

if (isAuthenticated) {
  document.body.className += " authenticated";
}
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

<comp.CodeBlock language="css" source="styles.css">
```
.logout {
  display: none;
}

.authenticated .logout {
  display: block;
}
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

<comp.CodeBlock language="html" source="index.html">
```
<a href="/logout" class="logout">Log out</a>
```
</comp.CodeBlock>
