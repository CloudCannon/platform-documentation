The *File browser* allows you to view all the folder and files in your Site using the same structure as your Git repository. The *File browser* is not filtered by your [Source folder](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-cloudcannon-configuration-file/#the-source-folder), and will show every file in your Git repository, including files for other Sites nested in the same respository.

The *File browser* is similar to a [Collection](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-collection/) browser but with fewer restrictions. For this reason, team members must be given [permission](/documentation/articles/what-are-permission-groups/) to access the *File browser*, either by being a member of the Technical Editor [default Permission Group](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/) or higher, or using the `site:source-editor:read` permission in a [Custom Permission Group](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/).

You can access the File browser in CloudCannon by clicking *Files* in your *Site Navigation* under the *Developer* heading.

The *File browser* shows you all the folders and files in your Site, with each file represented by a [Card](/documentation/articles/what-are-cards/). These file Cards will show:

* The filename.
* An icon based on the file extension.
* Some metadata associated with that file (e.g., date created, last updated, and file size).
* A preview, if the file is an image.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Unlike the *Collection browser*, you cannot configure the appearance of file [Cards](/documentation/articles/what-are-cards/) in the *File browser*.
</comp.Notice>

The *Sort* dropdown, the *View* dropdown, and the *File filter* search bar are at the top of the File browser. These tools allow you to customize the order in which your files appear, switch between *List*, *Card*, or *Gallery* view, and search for specific files.

The File also has an *\+ Add* button at the top right to add and upload files and subfolders to your Site. You can access additional file actions by opening the *Context Menu* at the top right of any folder or file card.

Clicking on a file will open it in CloudCannon's [Source Editor](/documentation/articles/the-source-editor/) by default. From your *File browser*, your team members can [add files](/documentation/articles/add-a-file/), [edit files](/documentation/articles/edit-your-files/), and [delete files](/documentation/articles/delete-a-file/).

As you make changes to your files, CloudCannon will help you keep track of those changes by adding a New, Edited, or Deleted *File Badge* to your file Cards. When you [save your changes](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/save-your-changes/), CloudCannon will update your Git repository and remove the *File Badges*.
