Permissions control what actions your team members can perform within your [Organization](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-organization/). The permissions of each team member are determined by which [Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-permission-groups/) they belong to. For each Permission Group, you can configure a set of permissions and give those permissions to every Group member.

  In CloudCannon, [default](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/) and [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/) are available depending on your [pricing plan](/pricing/). You cannot configure the permissions for Default Permission Groups.
