Client Sharing allows you to invite someone from outside your [Organization](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-organization/) (called a Client) to view, edit, and publish content for a specific Site. Clients do not need to have a CloudCannon account. Instead, they log into CloudCannon using a site-specific password. With Client Sharing, you can limit access to a single Site.

Clients will log in to your Site using a [password you set for your Site](/documentation/articles/turn-on-client-sharing-for-a-site/) through a dedicated Client Login Page. By default, the URL for the Login Page is the Site domain with the suffix "/update" (e.g., www.example.com/update). CloudCannon will use your [.cloudvent.net test domain](/documentation/articles/viewing-your-site-on-a-testing-domain/) if your Site does not have a custom domain. If you want to change the URL subpath, you can [configure the URL for the Login Page](/documentation/articles/configure-the-client-login-page-and-dashboard/).

Once a Client has logged in to your Site, they can access a simple version of the CloudCannon Site Dashboard. You can [configure the links in the *Site Navigation* of the Client Dashboard](/documentation/articles/configure-the-client-login-page-and-dashboard/) to support your Clients.

Clients count towards the number of team members in your Organization. Your Organization's maximum number of team members will depend on your [pricing plan](/pricing/).

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Although an unlimited number of people can use a Client Sharing password to log in to a Site, we do not recommend giving a Client Sharing password to multiple people. If multiple people share a password, you cannot determine which Client was responsible for which changes.
</comp.Notice>

There is one [Permission Group](/documentation/articles/what-are-permission-groups/) per Site for Client Sharing, scoped to the Site you want to share. This Permission Group contains permissions forâ€¦

&nbsp;

[Team and Enterprise customers](/pricing/) can customize the permissions in the Client Sharing Permission Group for each Site.

You can see a list of all Sites with Client Sharing enabled on the *Site Sharing* page under *Organization Settings*. To manage the *Site Sharing* settings for a specific card, click on the Site card or navigate to the *Client Sharing* page in your *Site Settings*.
