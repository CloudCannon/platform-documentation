Client Sharing allows you to invite someone from outside your [Organization](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-organization/) (called a Client) to view, edit, and publish content for a specific Site. Clients do not need to have a CloudCannon account. Instead, they log into CloudCannon using a site-specific password. With Client Sharing, you can limit access to a single Site.

Clients count towards the number of team members in your Organization. Your Organization's maximum number of team members will depend on your [pricing plan](/pricing/).

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Although an unlimited number of people can use a Client Sharing password to log in to a Site, we do not recommend giving a Client Sharing password to multiple people. If multiple people share a password, you cannot determine which Client was responsible for which changes.
</comp.Notice>

There is one [Permission Group](/documentation/articles/what-are-permission-groups/) per Site for Client Sharing, scoped to the Site you want to share. This Permission Group contains permissions forâ€¦

&nbsp;

[Team and Enterprise customers](/pricing/) can customize the permissions in the Client Sharing Permission Group for each Site.

You can see a list of all Sites with Client Sharing enabled on the *Site Sharing* page under *Organization Settings*. To manage the *Site Sharing* settings for a specific card, click on the Site card or navigate to the *Client Sharing* page in your *Site Settings*.
