When you save changes, you can provide a message describing the changes to refer back to later. To help maintain a consistent format in these messages, you can configure **commit templates** in your [global configuration](/documentation/articles/create-a-global-configuration-file/).

Commit templates are configured with template strings. See [this article](/documentation/articles/configuring-with-placeholders/) for more information about this.

To add a commit template, open your global configuration file and add an entry in `commit_templates`.

### Options

Commit templates have the following options available:

<comp.DataReference>
 <comp.DataReferenceRow label="label" type_markdown="String">
    Used to identify the commit template, for cases where multiple templates have been made available to the user.
 </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="template_path" type_markdown="String">
    The path to a file from your site's source files, relative to the root directory. The contents of this file will be used as the template.
 </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="template_string" type_markdown="String">
    Use this string as the template. This will only be used if `template_path` is not set.
 </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="_inputs" type_markdown="Object">
    Specify input fields that will be available to the committer. Read more about configuring inputs [here](/documentation/articles/configure-your-inputs/). Values from these inputs can be used to populate placeholders within the template.
 </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="extra_data" type_markdown="Object">
    Define variables which can be used a data placeholders. Values are template strings, so you can use this to build nested templates. Values are processed sequentially, before `template_string` or `template_path`.
 </comp.DataReferenceRow>
</comp.DataReference>

### Placeholders in commit templates

Commit templates can contain a combination of plain text and placeholders. Each placeholder is replaced with data. For example, your commit template might look like this:

```plaintext
{type}: {subject}
Committed by [author] at [date]
```

**Data placeholders** are always surrounded by `{ }` brackets, and are populated with values from inputs with matching keys (as configured with the `_inputs` key).

In this example, the editor might choose a "type" from a select box, and enter a summary in a text input labelled "subject".

**Commit placeholders** insert data related to the commit, and are always surrounded by `[ ]` brackets. The available commit placeholders are:

* `changes` is a bulleted list of all changes (edits, additions and deletions)
* `date` is the current date
* `author` is the email address of the person making the commit
* `default_commit_message` is the default commit message that CloudCannon would generate. This will resolve to a sentence like "Added/Updated X file(s)".

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If your commit template contains no placeholders, its contents will be loaded directly into a textarea, so the user can edit the whole thing before saving.
</comp.Notice>

### Filters

Placeholders support a number of **filters**. Filters are placed after a `|`, and multiple filters can be applied in sequence. For example, `{title|trim|uppercase}` will trim, then uppercase, a placeholder called "title". Read more about all the available placeholders [here](/documentation/articles/configuring-with-placeholders/).

### Examples

The default configuration simply uses the `default_commit_message`&nbsp;placeholder. This will be used if you don't have any configured commit templates.

<comp.CodeBlock language="yaml" source="/cloudcannon.config.yaml">
```
commit_templates:
  - template_string: "[default_commit_message]"
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

In the example below, the user can type into a text field labelled "Message", and leading/trailing whitespace will be trimmed off.

<comp.CodeBlock language="yaml" source="/cloudcannon.config.yaml">
```
commit_templates:
  - template_string: "{message|trim}"
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

In this third example, the template string is loaded from a file in the `.git` directory. Assuming the file contains no placeholders, its contents will be loaded into a text input for the user to edit, before saving.

This example most closely matches the `git --template=<file>` \[flag behaviour\](If your commit template contains no placeholders, its contents will be loaded directly into a textarea, so the user can edit the whole thing before saving.).

<comp.CodeBlock language="yaml" source="/cloudcannon.config.yaml">
```
commit_templates:
  - template_path: /.git/commit-message.txt
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

The `commit_templates` option takes an array, supporting multiple commit templates. The committer will be able to select the template they want from a dropdown.

Make sure to use the label field to help differentiate each template.

<comp.CodeBlock language="yaml" source="/cloudcannon.config.yaml">
```
commit_templates:
  - label: Trimmed message
    template_string: "{message|trim}"
  - label: Commit message from file
    template_path: /.git/commit-message.txt
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

You can use [input configuration](/documentation/articles/configure-your-inputs/) to take greater control over the data. In the example below, the committer will be able to select a "commit type" from a dropdown with three predefined options.

This commit template might result in a message like:

```
fix: removed security vulnerability
```

<comp.CodeBlock language="yaml" source="/cloudcannon.config.yaml">
```
commit_templates:
  - template_string: "{commit_type}: {message|trim}"
    _inputs:
      commit_type:
        type: select
        options:
          values:
            - feature
            - fix
            - refactor
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

You might want to have some specific formatting around an optional part of the commit message.

In the example below, the committer can fill in a text field called "Breaking Change Message". This message will appear after a blank line, and will be prepended with a ⚠️ warning emoji. However, thanks to the `if` filter, the blank line and emoji won't be added if `breaking_change_message` is left empty.

This commit template might result in either of the following messages:

```
Updated dependencies
```

```
Removed insecure endpoint

⚠️ /passwords is no longer available
```

<comp.CodeBlock language="yaml" source="/cloudcannon.config.yaml">
```
commit_templates:
  - template_string: "{message}{breaking_change|if=breaking_change_message}"
    _inputs:
      breaking_change_message:
        type: text
    extra_data:
      breaking_change: |-

        ⚠️ {breaking_change_message}
```
</comp.CodeBlock>
