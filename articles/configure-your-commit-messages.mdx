A commit message is a short piece of text used to describe changes you make to you website. Commit messages provide a record of your changes for you and your team members. If you have commit messages configured, the *Review changes* modal will prompt you to add a commit message every time you [save your changes](/documentation/articles/save-your-changes/).

Commit messages in CloudCannon use predefined templates to maintain a consistent format. These templates use template strings to populate the commit message with a mix of text and data. For more information, please read our documentation on [template strings](/documentation/articles/configure-your-template-strings/).

You can configure a commit message by adding the array key `commit_templates` to your [global configuration file](/documentation/articles/create-a-global-configuration-file/).

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json", "JavaScript"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
```
commit_templates___1___:
  - template_string___2___: "{message}"
```
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  Text
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="2">
  test
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

### Commit messages and external integrations

Depending on your Git provider, some external programs can integrate with your repository and read your commit messages. For example, the Jira and GitHub integration enables commits to your repository that use a specific commit message format to close Jira tickets.

It is important to configure your template string correctly if you need your commit message to match a particular format for an integration.

### Options

Commit templates have the following options available:

<comp.DataReference>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="label" type_markdown="String">
    Used to identify the commit template, for cases where multiple templates have been made available to the user.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="template_path" type_markdown="String">
    The path to a file from your site's source files, relative to the root directory. The contents of this file will be used as the template.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="template_string" type_markdown="String">
    Use this string as the template. This will only be used if `template_path` is not set.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="_inputs" type_markdown="Object">
    Specify input fields that will be available to the committer. Read more about configuring inputs [here](/documentation/articles/configure-your-inputs/). Values from these inputs can be used to populate placeholders within the template.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="extra_data" type_markdown="Object">
    Define variables which can be used a data placeholders. Values are template strings, so you can use this to build nested templates. Values are processed sequentially, before `template_string` or `template_path`.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
</comp.DataReference>

### Placeholders in commit templates

Commit templates can contain a combination of plain text and placeholders. Each placeholder is replaced with data. For example, your commit template might look like this:

```plaintext
{type}: {subject}
Committed by [author] at [date]
```

**Data placeholders** are always surrounded by `{ }` brackets, and are populated with values from inputs with matching keys (as configured with the `_inputs` key).

In this example, the editor might choose a "type" from a select box, and enter a summary in a text input labelled "subject".

**Commit placeholders** insert data related to the commit, and are always surrounded by `[ ]` brackets. The available commit placeholders are:

* `changes` is a bulleted list of all changes (edits, additions and deletions)
* `date` is the current date
* `author` is the email address of the person making the commit
* `default_commit_message` is the default commit message that CloudCannon would generate. This will resolve to a sentence like "Added/Updated X file(s)".

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If your commit template contains no placeholders, its contents will be loaded directly into a textarea, so the user can edit the whole thing before saving.
</comp.Notice>

### Filters

Placeholders support a number of **filters**. Filters are placed after a `|`, and multiple filters can be applied in sequence. For example, `{title|trim|uppercase}` will trim, then uppercase, a placeholder called "title". Read more about all the available placeholders [here](/documentation/articles/configure-your-template-strings/).

### Examples

The default configuration simply uses the `default_commit_message`&nbsp;placeholder. This will be used if you don't have any configured commit templates.

<comp.CodeBlock language="yaml" source="/cloudcannon.config.yaml">
```
commit_templates:
  - template_string: "[default_commit_message]"
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

In the example below, the user can type into a text field labelled "Message", and leading/trailing whitespace will be trimmed off.

<comp.CodeBlock language="yaml" source="/cloudcannon.config.yaml">
```
commit_templates:
  - template_string: "{message|trim}"
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

In this third example, the template string is loaded from a file in the `.git` directory. Assuming the file contains no placeholders, its contents will be loaded into a text input for the user to edit, before saving.

This example most closely matches the `git --template=<file>` \[flag behaviour\](If your commit template contains no placeholders, its contents will be loaded directly into a textarea, so the user can edit the whole thing before saving.).

<comp.CodeBlock language="yaml" source="/cloudcannon.config.yaml">
```
commit_templates:
  - template_path: /.git/commit-message.txt
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

The `commit_templates` option takes an array, supporting multiple commit templates. The committer will be able to select the template they want from a dropdown.

Make sure to use the label field to help differentiate each template.

<comp.CodeBlock language="yaml" source="/cloudcannon.config.yaml">
```
commit_templates:
  - label: Trimmed message
    template_string: "{message|trim}"
  - label: Commit message from file
    template_path: /.git/commit-message.txt
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

You can use [input configuration](/documentation/articles/configure-your-inputs/) to take greater control over the data. In the example below, the committer will be able to select a "commit type" from a dropdown with three predefined options.

This commit template might result in a message like:

```
fix: removed security vulnerability
```

<comp.CodeBlock language="yaml" source="/cloudcannon.config.yaml">
```
commit_templates:
  - template_string: "{commit_type}: {message|trim}"
    _inputs:
      commit_type:
        type: select
        options:
          values:
            - feature
            - fix
            - refactor
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

You might want to have some specific formatting around an optional part of the commit message.

In the example below, the committer can fill in a text field called "Breaking Change Message". This message will appear after a blank line, and will be prepended with a ⚠️ warning emoji. However, thanks to the `if` filter, the blank line and emoji won't be added if `breaking_change_message` is left empty.

This commit template might result in either of the following messages:

```
Updated dependencies
```

```
Removed insecure endpoint

⚠️ /passwords is no longer available
```

<comp.CodeBlock language="yaml" source="/cloudcannon.config.yaml">
```
commit_templates:
  - template_string: "{message}{breaking_change|if=breaking_change_message}"
    _inputs:
      breaking_change_message:
        type: text
    extra_data:
      breaking_change: |-

        ⚠️ {breaking_change_message}
```
</comp.CodeBlock>
