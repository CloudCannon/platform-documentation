An inbox is a page on CloudCannon where you can view visitor form submissions. The link to your inbox appears in your *Site navigation*. You can create up to 100 inboxes per Site. We recommend creating a new inbox for each form available on your website.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Each inbox has a limit of 2250 submissions per month. If you need a higher submission limit, please contact our friendly [support team](/support/).
</comp.Notice>

## Create an inbox

To create a form inbox:

1. Navigate to the *Forms* page under *Site Settings*.
2. Select the *\+ New inbox* option in the *Inbox* dropdown under *Connect inbox*. CloudCannon will open the *New inbox* modal.
3. Enter a name for your inbox in the *Name* text field. We recommend using something relevant to the data you expect visitors to submit (e.g., "Contact Us Form").
4. Enter a unique ID key in the *ID key* text field (e.g., "about-page-contact-us").
5. (Optional.) Enter a number in the *Submission storage time* number field to specify how many days CloudCannon should store submissions for. CloudCannon will not automatically delete submissions if you leave this field blank.
6. (Optional.) If you have configured a CAPTCHA provider, select your provider from the *CAPTCHA* *provider* dropdown, and enter the details in the *Site key* and *Secret key* text fields. For more information, please read our documentation on [CAPTCHA](/documentation/articles/what-is-captcha/).
7. Click the *Create inbox* button.

CloudCannon will create the form inbox. This inbox is now available from all Sites on your Organization.

Alternatively, you can create an inbox from the *Forms* page under *Org Settings*.

## Manage an inbox

You can update your inbox settings at any time by navigating to the *Forms* page under *Org Settings* and clicking on the inbox card. The *Inbox* page has four tabs: *Submissions*, *Sites*, *Settings*, and *Danger zone*.

The *Submissions* tab shows all the  visitor submissions collected by this inbox. For more information, please read our documentation on [managing your submissions](/documentation/articles/viewing-your-form-submissions-in-cloudcannon/).

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

The *Sites* tab shows all CloudCannon Sites currently connected to this inbox. For more information, please read our documentation on [connecting a form inbox to your Site](/documentation/articles/connecting-your-site-to-an-inbox/).

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

The *Settings* tab allows you to edit your inbox *Name*, *ID key*, *Submission storage time*, and *CAPTCHA provider*. You can also manage your *Inbox targets*. For more information, please read our documentation on configuring your inbox targets.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Be careful when you update the inbox *ID key*, as all the forms on your website that reference that inbox will break. You must also update the forms to use the new ID key. For more information, please read our documentation on [connecting a form inbox to your Site](/documentation/articles/connecting-your-site-to-an-inbox/).
</comp.Notice>

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

The *Danger zone* tab allows you to delete an inbox. This action will remove the inbox from all connected Sites and delete all stored submissions. You cannot recover an inbox once you have deleted it.
