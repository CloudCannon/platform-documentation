An inbox is a page on CloudCannon where you can view visitor form submissions. The link to your inbox appears in your *Site navigation*. You can create up to 100 inboxes per Site. We recommend creating a new inbox for each form available on your website.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Each inbox has a limit of 2250 submissions per month. If you need a higher submission limit, please contact our friendly [support team](/support/).
</comp.Notice>

## Create an inbox

To create a form inbox:

1. Navigate to the *Forms* page under *Site Settings*.
2. Select the *\+ New inbox* option in the *Inbox* dropdown under *Connect inbox*. CloudCannon will open the *New inbox* modal.
3. Enter a name for your inbox in the *Name* text field. We recommend using something relevant to the data you expect visitors to submit (e.g., "Contact Us Form").
4. Enter a unique ID key in the *ID key* text field (e.g., "about-page-contact-us").
5. (Optional.) Enter a number in the *Submission storage time* number field to specify how many days CloudCannon should store submissions for. CloudCannon will not automatically delete submissions if you leave this field blank.
6. (Optional.) If you have configured a CAPTCHA provider, enter the details in the *CAPTCHA* provider, *Site key*, and *Secret key* text fields. For more information, please read our documentation on [CAPTCHA](/documentation/articles/what-is-captcha/).
7. Click the *Create inbox* button.

CloudCannon will create the form inbox. This inbox is now available from all Sites on your Organization.
