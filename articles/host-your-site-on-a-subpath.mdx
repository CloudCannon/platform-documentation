A subpath is an additional name prefixing your page slug and suffixing your domain name. Subpaths help you to separate and organize content on your Site.

To connect your Site to a subpath, you must have access to the main domain name and be hosting a CloudCannon Site on the main domain.

To host your Site on a subpath:

1. Open the Site you want to host on a subpath.
2. Navigate to the *Custom Domain* page under *Site Settings*.
3. Select the *Attach on subpath of existing site* option in the *Choose your hosting option* dropdown.
4. In the *Existing Site* dropdown, select the CloudCannon Site connected to the main domain you want to use.
5. In the *Subpath* text field, enter the name of the subpath on which you want to host this Site (e.g., documentation). You do not have to include any `/` characters.
6. Click the *Attach to subpath* button.

CloudCannon will now host this Site on a subpath.

Subpaths do not get a dedicated Card in the *Domains browser*. Instead, your Site will appear in the list of Sites using the main domain name (i.e., the Site connected to support.example.com will appear in the list of Sites connected to example.com).

To stop hosting your Site on a subpath, navigate to the *Danger zone* tab on the *Custom Domain* page and click the *Remove Custom Domain* button.
