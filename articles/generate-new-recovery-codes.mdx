You may need to generate new recovery codes if:

* You have used all sixteen codes from your previous set.
* The secure location where you store your codes has been compromised.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  You cannot disable this feature once you enable MFA for your CloudCannon account. For more information about MFA, please contact our [support team](/support/).
</comp.Notice>

To generate new recovery codes:

1. Log in to CloudCannon.
2. Navigate to the *Multi-factor Authentication* page under *Account Settings.*
3. Click the *Generate new recovery codes* button.
4. CloudCannon will generate sixteen recovery codes for your account. Copy these recovery codes and store them in a secure location.
5. Click the *I have saved my recovery codes* button. If you cancel or click away from this modal before clicking this button, your new recovery codes will not overwrite your existing recovery codes. You must explicitly agree that you have saved your recovery codes.

Your new recovery codes are now associated with your account.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  If you have lost your recovery codes, please generate a new set immediately.

  If you can no longer log in to your CloudCannon account because you do not have access to your device, authentication app, or recovery codes, please contact our [support team](/support/) as soon as possible.
