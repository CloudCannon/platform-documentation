Projects allow you to group multiple sites from the same repository together. You can set a main branch, which editors use to branch off their own sites, and merge them back in at a later date.

## Adding a new Project
To create a project:

1. Have at least one site in your [Organization](/documentation/edit/organization/) connected to a Git repository
2. Go to the *Projects* section
3. Click the **Create Project** button
4. Enter a name for your Project and click **Create Project**

#### Set the main branch
After creating your project, you will need to connect it to one of your sites. This site **must** be connected to a Git repository.

To connect the repository:

1. Navigate to the *Project Settings* tab
2. Under *Files*, select your repository from the **Git Repository** dropdown
3. In **Main Branch**, enter the name of the branch you would like to connect. It's a good idea to make this your main branch (e.g. `main`)
4. At the bottom of the page, click **Update Project**

  Any site with the same Git repository as the *Project* is attached and visible in the *Project / Sites* section.
</comp.Notice>

## Branching
Branching enables you and your team to create isolated versions of a site to make changes on. Changes made on a branched site do not affect the main site until explicitly published.

Branched sites are preconfigured with the same settings as the main site when created, and have a publishing workflow set up to use when changes are ready to go live. By default, branched sites are deleted automatically after being published.

To create a branched site:

1. Open your project and navigate to the *Sites* tab
2. Click the **Create Site** button
3. Enter a name for your site
4. Use an existing branch, or click the *Create New* tab and enter a branch name. You should only use an existing branch if it was branched from the main branch.
5. Click **Create Site** in the top right of the page

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Creating a branched site in CloudCannon also creates a branch on your connected Git repository.

## Other project settings
In the *Project Settings* tab there are a number of settings you can configure.

**Project Name** — Shows in the *Projects* screen, and next to the site name in the site navigation breadcrumb.

**External URL** — Shows in the *Projects* screen, and in the overview panel on the left of the *Project* interface. You may want to set this if your site is not hosted on CloudCannon. Changing this link will not alter your domain or hosting settings in any way.

**Description** — Shows in the overview panel on the left of the *Project* interface.

**Project Links** — Add handy links for you and your editors. Read more about [Project Links](/documentation/articles/add-project-links-to-make-common-tasks-even-quicker/).
