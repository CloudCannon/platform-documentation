Projects allow you to group multiple sites from the same repository. You can set up a main branch and enable team members to create branch sites and merge them back to the main branch at a later date.

## Adding a new Project

To create a project:

1. Click the *Projects* section on the CloudCannon sidebar.
2. Click the *+ Create Project* button in the top right of the *Projects* page.
3. Select your Git Provider and Repository. This can be a repository you have already connected to a site or an unconnected repository.
4. Select the name of your Main Branch. This needs to match the name of the branch in your Git Provider.
5. Click the *Create Project* button. If you have already connected this repository to a site, CloudCannon will automatically add that site to your new Project.

## Set your main branch

You now have a project! Let’s add your first site - which is usually your main branch.

1. Click the *Projects* section on the CloudCannon sidebar and open your Project.
2. Click the *+ Add new Site* button in the top right of the *Project* page.
3. Enter a name for your site in the *Site name* field. The branch will automatically receive the same name.
4. By default *Use an existing branch* will be selected. Select the name of your branch in the *Branch* dropdown menu. This menu will be automatically populated by the branch names from your Git Repository.
5. Click the *Create Site* button.
6. CloudCannon will build your new Site.

## Customize your Project

You can customize your Project in the *Project Settings* tab.

* **Project Name** — This appears at the top of your *Project* page and in the *Projects* list. This will default to the name of your connected repository.
* **Display URL** — This URL will appear at the top of the Project page so your team members can quickly navigate to it. We recommend using the URL for your output site. Changing this link will not alter your domain or hosting settings.
* **Description** — This will appear at the top of the Project page and in the Projects list. This field supports a limited set of Markdown syntax.
* **Related Links** — Add quick links for your project team members. Read our documentation on [Add Related Links to your project](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/add-related-links-to-your-project/).

## Branching

Site branching allows you to protect the content of your main site while your team makes changes on branch sites. Changes to branch sites only affect the main branch once explicitly published.

Creating a branched site in CloudCannon also creates a branch on your connected Git Repository. CloudCannon configures your branch sites with the same settings as your main site. By default, you can merge your branch sites into the main branch without needing review or approval; however, you can enable these processes through your Git Provider and in your *Site Settings*.

CloudCannon will automatically delete your branch sites after you merge them into your main branch. You can turn off branch deletion in your *Site Settings*.

If you do not have a main branch set for your project, you can still create branch sites. However, this action is limited to team members with Developer level permissions.

### Branching from Main

1. Click the *Projects* section on the CloudCannon sidebar and open your Project.
2. Click the *+ Add new Site* button in the top right of the *Project* page.
3. Enter a name for your site in the *New Site name* field. The branch will automatically receive the same name.
4. *Create a new branch* will be selected by default, and the *Source branch* will be set to your main branch. Click the *Create Site* button.
5. CloudCannon will build your new Site.
6. Once all your changes are saved, you can publish them back to the main branch. Click the *Publish* button in the sidebar. From the Publish page, you can create a Pull Request (if applicable) or merge new content directly into your main branch.
