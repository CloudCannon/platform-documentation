A “build” is when CloudCannon converts all your Site files into a single, functional program.

<comp.DocsImage path="" alt="" title=""/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Building is an optional step. If your Site is Dynamic, or you only want to use CloudCannon as a CMS for your git repository, you don’t need to build. For more information, please read our guide on using [CloudCannon in Headless Mode](/documentation/guides/headless-starter-guide/).
</comp.Notice>

&nbsp;

## Starting a build

x

&nbsp;

You can start a build by:

* Commiting edits to your Git repository after [editing your files](/documentation/articles/edit-your-files/) in CloudCannon or locally
* Updating your build configuration, such as your [SSG](/documentation/articles/select-your-ssg/), [command line options](/documentation/articles/configure-your-command-line-options/), [caching options](/documentation/articles/configure-caching-between-builds/), or unlocking builds on your Site.
* Clicking the *Rebuild* button on the *Status* page
* Configuring [manual](/documentation/articles/scheduling-your-builds-manually/) or [automatic build scheduling](/documentation/articles/scheduling-your-next-build-automatically/).
* Using the CloudCannon API.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  The CloudCannon API is currently available through a private Beta. Want to chat about whether this feature is right for you? Our support team is always <a href="mailto:success@cloudcannon.com?subject=A%20question%20about%20the%20CloudCannon%20API" rel="noreferrer">happy to hear from you</a>.
</comp.Notice>

You can prevent a Site from building by [locking builds]().

&nbsp;

Builds can be started by:

1. Files being changed from Git or within the editing interfaces
2. Changing build configuration (e.g. CLI options, SSG Choice, caching options or toggling building locked)
3. Triggering a rebuild from the Site / Status page
4. Using [automatic scheduling](/documentation/articles/scheduling-your-next-build-automatically/) or [manual scheduling](/documentation/articles/scheduling-your-builds-manually/)
5. Using our API currently on private beta

Sites can be prevented from building by turning on ‘Building Locked’ within the site settings. This is useful when you want to manage a deployment more manually. Most editing configuration is read at build time, so changes to configuration may be delayed while building is locked.

## What happens during a build?

CloudCannon uses a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) system. Every time you trigger a build of your Site, CloudCannon will:

1. Download your files onto our server.
2. Run your selected install commands (e.g., `npm install`, `bundle install`).
3. Run your selected build commands (e.g., `npm run build`).
4. Index your output files.
5. Upload your output files to CloudCannon to generate previews (i.e., the test domain, visual editor, and in-app screenshots) and deliver them to your live domain (if you are [hosting with CloudCannon](/documentation/articles/using-cloudcannon-dns-to-configure-your-custom-domain/)).

Additionally, you can [configure build hooks](/documentation/articles/extending-your-build-process-with-hooks/) to run extra commands during your Site build. Build hooks are useful for downloading external data, running test commands, and more.

CloudCannon runs your build commands using `bash` in an isolated environment powered by `Ubuntu`. In addition to bash, CloudCannon uses several other programs and libraries, such as Deno, Go, Node.js, and Ruby. You can [pin a version of these dependencies](/documentation/articles/pin-your-dependency-version/) to maintain consistency between builds.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  For more information about CloudCannon's build environment, please contact our [support team](/support/).
</comp.Notice>

## Reading your build output logs

CloudCannon produces a log every time it runs a build. You can use your build log to follow CloudCannon's build process and diagnose your build if CloudCannon runs into an error.

While CloudCannon is building your Site, you can read the build output files by clicking on the *View output* button in the notification at the bottom right of the app. This will open the build terminal.

<comp.DocsImage path="" alt="" title=""/>

The build terminal has three tools: the *Copy Output* button and the checkboxes for *Scroll to bottom* and *Show timing*. The *Copy Output* button lets you to copy your build log as plain text. The status of the *Scroll to bottom* and *Show timing* checkboxes will persist between builds and control which section of the log the terminal displays and toggle log event times, respectively.

You can view old build logs on the *Status* page (this page is not available to members of the [Editors Permission Group](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/)).

## Caching between builds

To improve the speed of your builds, CloudCannon attempts to send consecutive builds from a single Site to the same server. You can configure file caching so that CloudCannon only uses server time for files updated between builds. This allows you to skip expensive and repetitive operations.

Caching is great for minimizing the effect of build steps that are typically slow, such as image optimization, installing dependencies, and external data fetching. For more information, please read our documentation on [configuring caching between builds](/documentation/articles/configure-caching-between-builds/).

Once your files are synced to CloudCannon the next step is to run your build. This mirrors your local development environment: Every time your files change, a build is run to produce your website. This workflow allows you to have complete control over how your website looks and functions.

## Setting up your build

When setting up a site you will be asked how to build your static site from your source files. This includes options for:

1. Selecting your SSG and its CLI options
2. Setting environment variables
3. Setting the folder that will contain your built site
4. CloudCannon specific options

If you have any questions about the options in your build, see the [Configuring your build](/documentation/articles/configuring-your-build/) document or contact support.
