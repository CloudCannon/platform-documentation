By default, all the URLs to assets on your DAM need to be fully-qualified to preview on CloudCannon. Similarly, CloudCannon will always save fully-qualified URLs in your code when you upload an asset to a DAM through the CMS.

In some cases, you might prefer all your DAM URLs to start with "/", instead of being fully-qualified. You can achieve this by setting your DAM as your **main asset source**.

### Main source configuration

The main asset source for your site can be the site files or a DAM linked to the site. By default, the main source is your site files.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  If you choose a DAM to be your main asset source, you will not be able to browse assets from, or upload to, your site files in CloudCannon.
</comp.Notice>

1. In your siteâ€™s settings, navigate to *Files/Assets*
2. Locate your DAM (or Site Files) from the list, and click the three dots in the top right corner
3. From the context menu, click **Set Main Source**
4. Click the Confirm button

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  When changing your main asset source, you might need to rewrite existing URLs on the site, to avoid broken previews in CloudCannon.
