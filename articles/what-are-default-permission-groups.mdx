CloudCannon provides several default [Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-permission-groups/), allowing you to select which level of permission is appropriate for each team member. Each Group has a defined scope and set of permissions. These are:

* Four Permission Groups with Global scope (Owners, Developers, Technical Editors, and Editors).
* Two Permission Groups per Site, each with a Site scope for  Site Sharing (Technical Editors and Editors).
* One Permission Group per Site with Site scope for Client Sharing.

This article will cover the four Default Permission Groups with Global scope. For more information on the Default Permission Groups with a Site scope, please read our documentation on [Site Sharing](/documentation/articles/share-a-site-with-site-sharing/) and [Client Sharing](/documentation/articles/share-a-site-with-client-sharing/).

The four Default Permission Groups with Global scope are hierarchical. This means that each Group contains the permissions of all the Groups below it in the hierarchy, with the Owners Group containing all permissions and the Editors Group containing the smallest subset of permissions.

## Owners

Members of the Owners permission group have access to everything! This includes complete control of your Sites, Organization, files, Git repository connections, billing, and CloudCannon team members.

When you create an Organization, your account is automatically added to the Owners permission group. There must be at least one team member in the Owners permission group

For a full list of permissions, please read our reference documentation on [permissions](/documentation/articles/permissions-reference/).
