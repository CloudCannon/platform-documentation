Every site on CloudCannon has a matching **.cloudvent.net** URL. Use this to test on a live site without having to set up your own domain.

Testing domains are generated with an adjective and a noun. For example: [**grey-grouse.cloudvent.net**](https://grey-grouse.cloudvent.net/) or [**brave-submarine.cloudvent.net**](https://brave-submarine.cloudvent.net/). To stop serving content on this domain, add [Password Authentication](/documentation/host/authentication/password/) or [contact support](/contact).

### Robots.txt
CloudCannon automatically serves a default *robots.txt* file on all testing domains to ensure that these sites are not indexed by search engines.
