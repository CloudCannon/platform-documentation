CloudCannon Links allow you to reference other sections of the CloudCannon interface. These are used within Editor links and Add options.

## Syntax
CloudCannon Links are formatted with `cloudcannon:{path}#{slug}` and match the URL structure of the CloudCannon app.

<comp.DataReference>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="path" type_markdown="string">
    The relative path of the collection inside of the site url. For example  `https://app.cloudcannon.com/123/editor#sites/456/dashboard` would become  `dashboard` which targets the current site's dashboard.

    If you want your link to be relative to `https://app.cloudcannon.com/` add  a `!` to the start of your URL. This is used internally for linking to the  templates list and using this is not recommended.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="slug" type_markdown="string">
    Modelled after [JavaScripts property accessors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_accessors), this is a recursive representation of your desired object target. Starting from the base of your structure, name each item as a step towards your desired object. Each object or property is separated by a dot. An array item is denoted by an open square bracket, an integer starting from 0, followed by a closing square bracket (`[index]`).
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
</comp.DataReference>

### Linking to front matter
By excluding the front path, the cloudcannon link is relative to the current page. This is useful for keeping your code DRY. For example:
- `cloudcannon:#title` Targets the title of the current page
- `cloudcannon:#seo.title` Targets the title within the seo object
- `cloudcannon:#people[0]` Targets the first array item in an array named people.
- `cloudcannon:#people[0].title` Targets the title of the first array item within an array named people.

### Creating an array item
A special case of slug editing is the `+`, by targeting an array you can trigger an item to be added to the end of the array. For example `cloudcannon:#people[+]` Create a new item in an array named people.
