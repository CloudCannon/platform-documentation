<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Managing your SSL certificate on CloudCannon requires you to host your Site through CloudCannon. If you are hosting your Site through an external service, please review their documentation on SSL certification.
</comp.Notice>

A wildcard SSL certificate protects a single domain and all its subdomains (e.g., example.com and its subdomains blog.example.com, support.example.com, app.example.com etc.).

CloudCannon automatically adds a free wildcard SSL certificate to all Sites hosted on CloudCannon through ZeroSSL and Cloudflare. These certificates renew automatically each year, so you Site is never unsecure.

After adding a wildcard SSL certificate, CloudCannon serves your Site over HTTPS. You can also redirect any users trying to access your website through the HTTP URL to the correct HTTPS URL.

Before you add an SSL certificate to your Site, you must [add a Custom Domain](/documentation/articles/add-a-custom-domain/) to your [Organization](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-organization/).

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If you have recently added your Custom Domain to your Site, CloudCannon may need a few minutes to fetch your domain details before you can add an SSL certificate. If this process takes more than a few minutes, please contact our friendly [support team](/support/).
</comp.Notice>

To add a wildcard SSL certificate and HTTPS redirects:

1. Navigate to the *SSL* tab on the *Custom Domain* page, under *Site Settings*.
2. Select a version number in the *Minimum TLS Version* dropdown.
3. Select the *DNS Text Record* option from the *Validation Method* dropdown.
4. Ensure the *Generate a wildcard certificate to enable SSL on \*example.com* checkbox is ticked.
5. Click the *Update SSL* button.

CloudCannon will add a wildcard SSL certificate to your domain and all subdomains.
