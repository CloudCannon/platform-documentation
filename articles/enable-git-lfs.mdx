  Git LFS is used to store large files outside your repository, but continue
  using them as if they were part of it. It's a great way to maintain a small
  repository size for faster syncing and builds, while keeping the external
  services you rely on the same.

[Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (Git LFS) enables you to store large files outside of your Git repository, but continue to access them as if they were within the repository. Enabling Git LFS is a great way to maintain a smaller repository size for faster syncing and building.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  A great way to use Git LFS is to track your uploads path, so new asset files in the editor are stored there. Running `git lfs track "uploads/**"` tracks all files inside of the `/uploads` folder.
</comp.Notice>

Setting up Git LFS is a two part process:

1. Install Git LFS
2. Enable Git LFS in your CloudCannon Site Settings

To install Git LFS, follow the installation guide on the [Git Large File Storage website](https://git-lfs.github.com/). Alternatively, you can use the instructions provided by [Bitbucket](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/use-git-lfs-with-bitbucket/), [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage), or [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/lfs/).

To enable Git LFS for your Site:

1. Navigate to the *Source Syncing* page under *Site Settings*.
2. Check the *Enable Git LFS* checkbox under *Additional Settings*.
3. Click the *Update Settings* button.

You have enabled Git LFS on CloudCannon.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  CloudCannon will prompt you to check the *Enable Git LFS* option in your Site Settings if it detects you have a `.gitattributes` file in your repository. This warning will appear in the *Needs Attention* section on your *Status* page.
