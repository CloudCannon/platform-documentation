CloudCannon uses the LTS (<comp.SystemVersionDefault language="node" item="node"/>) version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) by default. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md) to select which node version to use with your build.

The following [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) versions are pre-installed:

<comp.SystemVersionList language="node" item="node"/>

Each [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version has the following packages preinstalled globally:

* [Rosey](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rosey)
* [Reseed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reseed)
* [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

## Usage

Select which nvm version to use in your [preinstall](/documentation/articles/extending-your-build-process-with-hooks/) script:

<comp.CodeBlock language="shell" source=".cloudcannon/preinstall">
```
nvm use v14.18.3
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Or install and use a custom version:

<comp.CodeBlock language="shell" source=".cloudcannon/preinstall">
```
nvm install v17.5.0
nvm use v17.5.0
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

### .nvmrc

Add a `.nvmrc` to your site's root directory to specify which node version to use. For example:

<comp.CodeBlock language="plaintext" source=".nvmrc">
```
v12.22.9
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Then in your preinstall script:

<comp.CodeBlock language="shell" source=".cloudcannon/preinstall">
```
nvm use
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  CloudCannon does not have pnpm preinstalled. However, you can use `/.cloudcannon/preinstall` to add pnpm to your build/install commands.
