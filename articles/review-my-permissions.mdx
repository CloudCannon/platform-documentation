Permissions control what actions you can perform within your [Organization](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-organization/). Your permissions are determined by which [Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/default-permission-groups/) you belong to.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  You or a team member in your Organization will have permission to change which Permission Groups you belong to. For more information, please read our documentation on [managing your team members](/documentation/articles/manage-your-team-members/).
</comp.Notice>

Permission groups are always additive. In other words, permissions from one Group do not negate permissions from another. CloudCannon will allow you to perform an action if you have permission to do so from at least one source. For more information about permissions, read our documentation on [default Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/default-permission-groups/) and our [permissions reference](/documentation/articles/permissions-reference/) documentation.

To view your current permissions:

1. Navigate to the *My permissions* page under *Org settings.*
