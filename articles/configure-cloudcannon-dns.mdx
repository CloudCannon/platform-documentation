A fast, scalable DNS service automatically configured for your site.

Using CloudCannon DNS allows you to manage your DNS records within CloudCannon, and provides a free wildcard SSL certificate for your domain.

Once you have added your domain name, follow these steps to start using *CloudCannon DNS*:

* Access the settings for your domain via the *Domains* button (globe icon) on the left sidebar.
* Select your domain, then open the *Configuration* tab.
* Ensure you are using *CloudCannon DNS*. Otherwise, click **CloudCannon DNS** and *Switch to CloudCannon DNS*.

Your DNS records will be updated.

The next step is to configure your name servers, which needs to be completed on your domain registrar.

* Find the list of *Expected Name Servers* in the settings for your domain.
* Go to your domain registrarâ€™s settings for the domain, and add the *Expected Name Servers* provided by CloudCannon.
* Save the changes.

  If you are not sure which domain registrar you are using, check with ICANN Lookup.
