1. Navigate to the *Domain browser* by clicking the globe icon in your *App Navigation*.
2. Select the domain for which you want to configure DNS.
3. Under the *Domain Settings* tab, open the *DNS* section.
4. Select the *CloudCannon DNS* option in the *DNS Provider* dropdown.
5. Click the *Update DNS Provider* button.

## Configure your Nameservers

If you have yet to configure your Nameservers, or have done so incorrectly, CloudCannon will warn you that this action is required on the *Custom Domain* page under *Site Settings*.

Configuring your Nameservers requires you to use the services provided by your Domain Registrar. For support, please contact your Domain Registrar.

To configure your Nameservers:

1. Log in to your third party Domain Registrar with the account details use used when you purchased your Domain Name. If you don't know who your Domain Registrar is, you can enter the Domain Name into the [ICANN website](https://lookup.icann.org/en/lookup) and scroll down to Registrar Information.
2. Update the Nameserver configuration on your Domain Registrar to *asa.ns.cloudflare.com* and *roan.ns.cloudflare.com*.

CloudCannon will update your
