## Host your Site on a subdomain

If you want your main domain to be a subdomain, you need to redirect your base domain name to the subdomain.

To set a subdomain as your main domain:

1. Create two Sites, one with your main domain and one with a subdomain.
2. Navigate to the *Domain browser* from your *Org Navigation* or *Organization Dashboard*.
3. Click the Card for the domain you want to configure.
4. Open the *Domain Settings* tab and navigate to the *Redirects* section.
5. Click the *Set Main Domain* button on the Site you want CloudCannon to treat as your main domain.

CloudCannon will redirect all unused subdomains (including the base domain) to your main domain.

  If you have configured your [DNS](/documentation/articles/what-is-dns/) to point a specific domain at a service outside of CloudCannon, CloudCannon will not be able to redirect that domain to your main domain.
