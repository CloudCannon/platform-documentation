Sometimes there are unforeseen problems that arise in a team, and domain ownership can fall into the wrong hands. This usually results in a support message to CloudCannon.

When resolving these ownership issues, we do our best to protect all parties involved during these processes. If we are asking for proof of ownership, it is well-intentioned.

Below is the information that is stored with a site:

* Files (Untransferable)
* Domain Name (Transferable)

We canâ€™t transfer the files, but these are hopefully accessible from your end (through storage providers). The domain name can be transferred once the domain ownership is proven.

### Proving domain ownership
Sometimes you can't contact the CloudCannon organization that is using the domain.

In this case, contact support. We'll ask you to demonstrate ownership of the domain by adding a unique TXT DNS record to the root domain. We'll be able to check that you've added this, which will show us that you have control over the domain.

Once your ownership of the domain has been verified, we can remove the domain from the current organization, so that you can add it to your organization.

We'll also contact the current holder of the domain, to let them know what's happening. They'll be given a few days to demonstrate ownership of the domain. If both parties are able to prove ownership, we can't step in.

### Recreating your site
To get your site on your new Organization, add your files and add the domain once transferred. All should be the same. If the old Organization was being used for the same sites, we are happy to sort something out for the costs. This will usually be a coupon for the time remaining on the old Organization.
