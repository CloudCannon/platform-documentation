Adding a Digital Asset Manager (DAM) to your site enables you to store your images and other assets in an external service, separate from your content. DAMs improve site build times and allow you to reuse the same assets across different sites. With AWS S3 and CloudFront, you can cheaply and easily host your own DAM while still managing your files directly from CloudCannon.

You will need an AWS account to use S3. If you haven't already, [create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup.), then sign in to the AWS console.

### Create your S3 bucket
Open the AWS Services menu (in the top left corner), and navigate to *Storage* / *S3*.

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/assets-s3-aws_console_menu.png" alt="Screenshot of AWS services menu with S3 highlighted" type="screenshot" />

In the S3 console, click **Create bucket** in the top right. Enter a name for your bucket then click **Create bucket** again, leaving the other settings unchanged. Note that S3 bucket names must be globally unique, so it's often a good idea to include your organization name in your bucket name, for example, `my-organization-dam`.

Once created, select your new bucket and open the *Permissions* tab. Scroll down to the *Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)* section and click **Edit**. Copy the following JSON into the box:

<comp.CodeBlock language="json" source="CORS">
```

[
  {
    "AllowedHeaders": [
      "*"
    ],
    "AllowedMethods": [
      "GET",
      "PUT",
      "POST",
      "DELETE",
      "HEAD"
    ],
    "AllowedOrigins": [
      "*"
    ],
    "ExposeHeaders": []
  }
]
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

**(Optional)** Edit the *AllowedOrigins* key to include only your sites. Origins can either match single URLs `https://my-site.com` or multiple URLs using wildcards `https://*.my-site.com`. Make sure to also include `https://app.cloudcannon.com`, to ensure that CloudCannon can pull previews of your assets within the editor.

Once you are done, click **Save changes**.

### Create your CloudFront distribution
Open the AWS Services menu and navigate to *Networking & Content Delivery* / *CloudFront*.

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/assets-s3-aws_menu_cloudfront.png" alt="Screenshot of AWS Services menu with CloudFront highlighted" type="screenshot" />

In the top right of the screen, click **Create distribution**.

Under the *Origin* settings, set the **Origin domain** to your S3 bucket and set **Name** to what you want to name this distribution.

Under *Origin* / *S3 Bucket Access*, select **Yes use OAI**. Then create a new OAI by clicking the **Create new OAI** button and then clicking **Create** when prompted. Make sure the **Origin Access Identity** is set to your newly created OAI. Set *Bucket Policy* to **Yes update the bucket policy**.

Scroll to the *Default cache behavior* panel. Under **Viewer**, set the *Allowed HTTP methods* to **GET, HEAD, OPTIONS**.

Also in the *Default cache behavior* panel, under *Cache key and origin requests*, set *Origin request policy* to **CORS-S3Origin**, and the *Response headers policy* to **SimpleCORS**. As an optional step, if you're using wildcard origins in your S3 CORS settings create a new cache policy under *Cache policy.* Under *Cache key settings,* in the *Headers* section include the **Origin** *header*. Save that policy and set it as your distribution cache policy.

**(Optional)** Add any custom domain names you want to use for your DAM under *Settings* / *Alternate domain name (CNAME)*. If you're using HTTPS also configure your SSL certificate under *Settings &gt; Custom SSL Certificate.*

When you are done configuring, Click **Create distribution**. On the distribution dashboard, under *General* / *Details*, take note of the **Distribution domain name**, or one of its alternate domain names if applicable. Youâ€™ll need this later to connect your DAM to CloudCannon.

### Create an IAM policy
In the sidebar of the IAM console, navigate to *Access management* / *Policies*, then click **Create Policy**.

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/assets-s3-iam_policies.png" alt="Screenshot of IAM Policies dashboard" type="regular" />

In the *JSON* tab, and paste the following policy - replacing the placeholder bucket name with your own.

<comp.CodeBlock language="json" source={null}>
```

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObjectAcl",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
        "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:PutObjectAcl",
        "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::<PlaceholderBucketName>",
        "arn:aws:s3:::<PlaceholderBucketName>/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Click **Next** to Tags, then click **Next** again. Give your policy a name, then click **Create policy**.

### Create a CloudCannon IAM user
Open the AWS Services menu and navigate to *Security, Identity, & Compliance* / *IAM*.

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/assets-s3-aws_menu_iam.png" alt="Screenshot of the AWS Services menu with IAM highlighted" type="screenshot" />

In the Sidebar, navigate to *Access management* / *Users*, and click **Add users** in the top right of the page.

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/assets-s3-iam_users_console.png" alt="Screenshot of the AWS IAM Users dashboard" type="regular" />

Give the user a name (such as `CloudCannon`). Set the *AWS credential type* as **Access key - Programmatic access**, then click **Next: Permissions**.

On the next page, click **Attach existing policies directly**. locate the policy you created earlier, select it by ticking the check-box, then click **Next: Tags**, then **Next: Review**. Finally, click **Create user**.

Take note of your **Access key ID** and **Secret access key**. Once you leave this page, you will **not** be able to view the secret key again. You can recreate your access key + secret if you lose it.



#### Creating a new access key and secret
For security reasons, you may want to periodically change your access key. To create a new key, open your IAM user in the IAM console, and go to the *Security credentials* tab.

Under *Access keys*, click **Create access key**. A modal will open with your new access key and secret. Once you close this modal, you will **not** be able to view the secret again.

To remove an access key, first click **Make inactive**, then click **Deactivate** in the modal. Then, click the **x** attached to the respective key. In the modal, enter the key ID in the input field, then click **Delete**.

### Connecting your DAM to CloudCannon
Open your site settings in CloudCannon. Navigate to *Files* */* *Assets*. Under *Link DAM*, select **New DAM**.

Choose **Amazon S3** as your DAM type and enter a name - this will be used to identify your DAM in CloudCannon.

Set *Base URL* to the domain name of your CloudFront distribution or, if you chose to configure them, one of its alternate domain names.

Set *S3 Bucket Name* to the name of your bucket in S3.

Enter your *Access key ID* and *Secret access key* as your *IAM Access Key* and *IAM Access Secret,* respectively. If you closed your AWS console before you could copy these, read [how to create a new access key and secret](#creating-a-new-access-key-and-secret).

Click **Authenticate**, to save and close the modal, then click **Link DAM**.
