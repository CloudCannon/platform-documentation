<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Depending on your SSG and site configuration, you may not have access to the Content Editor for all files. An editing interface may not be available because:

  * A Developer on your team has [restricted which editing interfaces are enabled](/documentation/articles/set-a-default-editing-interface/) for a particular collection or schema.

## Content Editor features

The Content Editor might remind you of other rich text editors, like Google Docs or Microsoft Word. Writing the next piece of content for your website, adding images, links, and other content blocks, is easy. The Content Editor is a WYSIWYG editor, meaning that the way you format the content in the editor will resemble the way it will look on your website page (WYSIWYG is an acronym for What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get).

Letâ€™s go through a few of the features of the Content Editor.

For more information, including a walk-through of the *Editing interface navigation* and the *Context menu*, read our documentation on [editing your files](/documentation/articles/edit-your-files).

### The WYSIWYG toolbar

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/editing/editing-interfaces/2024-04/CloudCannon-Documentation-Rich-Text-WYSIWYG-Toolbar.png" alt="" title="" type="ui-snippet"/>

The *WYSIWYG toolbar* is found at the top of all rich text editors in CloudCannon (i.e., the Content Editor and [rich text inputs](/documentation/articles/rich-text-inputs/)). This toolbar is populated with tools to help you format your content. This might include adding images, links, and lists, changing the alignment of your text, or simple tools such as bolding, italicizing, or underlining text.

To use these tools, click to place your cursor in the content area of the editor (or, in some cases, highlight your existing text) and then click the icon for the tool you want to use. The number of tools available in your *WSYIWYG toolbar* will depend on how your site is configured.

For more information on how to customize your *WYSIWYG toolbar*, read our documentation on [configuring your rich text editors](/documentation/articles/configure-your-rich-text-editors/).

### The sidebar

The Content Editor sidebar allows you to edit the front matter content of your file. Front matter fields contain data that does not appear in the main body of the content.

For example, a blog post might have the content of the blog in the main body of the file, and fields for title, author, and date in the front matter. You or your developer can use front matter data to populate other areas of your webpage, outside of the main body of content.

You can open or close the sidebar using the arrow button on the right on the panel.

For more information on how to customize your front matter fields, read our documentation on [configuring your inputs](/documentation/articles/configure-your-inputs/).
