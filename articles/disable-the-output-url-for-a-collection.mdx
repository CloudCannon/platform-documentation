<comp.Notice info_type="permissions">
  <p><strong>Permissions required</strong></p><p>Members of the Owners, Developers, and Technical Editors <a href="/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/">Default Permission Groups</a>, or <a href="/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/">Custom Permission Groups</a> with the <code>site:source-editor:write</code> permission, can edit the <em>CloudCannon Configuration File</em> using <em>Configuration Mode</em>.</p>
</comp.Notice>

An [output URL](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-output-url/) is the URL CloudCannon outputs your files to during a [Site build](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-site-build/). You can disable the output URL for any *Collection* you do not want CloudCannon to output to a URL at build time. By default, CloudCannon does not output *Collections* named `data` or `_data`.

If you disable the output URL for a *Collection*, files from that *Collection* will not be visible on your [Testing Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-testing-domain/) or [Custom Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/), or in the [Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-visual-editor/), even if you have a template string configured for the *Collection*.

These instructions assume you want to build your *Site*, and have already grouped your files into *Collections*.

To disable the output URL for a *Collection*:

1. Navigate to the *Collection* for which you want to update the output URL.
2. Turn on *Configuration Mode* using the switch on the right of the *Site Header*. Purple *Edit Configuration* buttons will appear in the *Collection Browser*.
3. Click the *Edit Advanced* in the top right of the *Collection Browser*. CloudCannon will open the *Edit Advanced* data panel.
4. Identify the *Disable URL* checkbox and ensure it is ticked.
5. Save the change to your *Site*.

CloudCannon will automatically rebuild your *Site*, without this *Collection* output to a URL.
