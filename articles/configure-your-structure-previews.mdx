You can alter how your [structures](/documentation/articles/create-a-structure/) appear by configuring the preview for each structure. When you have [many structures under the same key](/documentation/articles/create-a-structure/#add-multiple-structures-to-the-same-key), configuring the appearance of these structures is a good way to differentiate between them and create an intuitive experience for your team members.

CloudCannon uses a [data card](/documentation/articles/configure-your-card-previews/) to represent each structure in [objects](/documentation/articles/editing-objects-in-your-data/) and [arrays](/documentation/articles/using-arrays-to-edit-your-data). These cards are configurable UI elements that give you a preview of that data. Cards representing your structures appear in the dropdown menu, [pop-up modal](/documentation/articles/create-a-structure/#add-multiple-structures-to-the-same-key), and in the [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-data-editor) or sidebar of the [Visual](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-visual-editor) or [Content Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-content-editor).

You can configure how card previews look using the `preview` key. For each structure, you can configure the values for the text, subtext, image, and icon within the `preview` key. The `text`, `subtext`, `image`, and `icon` keys can contain a string, a key, or an array of strings or keys.

* `text` — Add a title to your structure preview.
* `subtext` — Add a subtitle to your structure preview underneath your title. (If `text` is not configured, then the string for `subtext` will appear in the title.)
* `image` — Add an image to your structure preview.
* `icon` — Add an icon from Google’s [Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Icons) list to your structure preview. The name of your icon must match the Material Icon name.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Icons and images appear in the same place on your preview. If your image fails to load or has no value, it will fall back to an icon (if one is configured).
</comp.Notice>

Let’s go over an example of how you would configure the preview of a structure.

We want to create an array of staff members for our staff web page. The staff array can contain items which use either an "Employee" or a "Manager" template. We'll create these item templates using two structures. The Employee structure will have fields for a name, job description, and profile picture. The Manager structure will have the same fields but also include a URL field for a link to their calendar. We will configure these fields under the `value` key in each structure.

We can configure how these structures look under the `preview` key. Let’s implement the following:

* Make the staff member’s name, job description, and profile picture appear on each card in the array.
* When no name, job description, or profile picture is selected, the fields fall back to a string or icon.

Here is our structure configuration:

<comp.CodeBlock language="YAML" source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
```
_inputs:
  staff:
    type: array
  profile_picture:
    type: image
  job_description:
    type: textarea

_structures:
  staff:
    style: modal
    values:
      - preview:
          text:
            - key: name
            - Employee
          subtext:
            - key: job_description
            - Description of position
          image:
            - key: profile_picture
          icon: support_agent
        value:
          _type: Employee
          name:
          job_description:
          profile_picture:
      - preview:
          text:
            - key: name
            - Manager
          subtext:
            - key: job_description
            - Description of position
          image:
            - key: profile_picture
          icon: face
        value:
          _type: Manager
          name:
          job_description:
          profile_picture:
          url:
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

In our configuration file, the objects `preview.text` and `preview.subtext` contain arrays. These arrays initially set the object value to the keys `name` or `job_description` but also have a fallback string if no values are found. For the object `preview.text`, the fallback string is either “Employee” or “Manager”, depending on the structure. For the object `preview.subtext`, the fallback string is “Description of position”.

In both structures, we have configured the object `preview.image` to equal the value of the `profile_picture` key. If no value is found, we have configured the object `preview.icon` to equal an icon from Google’s [Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Icons) list. The icon is `face` or `support_agent`, depending on the structure.

At the top of this configuration file, we have also defined a few inputs (i.e., `staff`, `profile_picture`, and `job_description`). For more information on this, read our documentation on [configuring your inputs](/documentation/articles/configure-your-inputs).

Here is the front matter of the file containing our array:

<comp.CodeBlock language="markdown" source="staff_page.md">
```
staff: []
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Let’s populate the array to see the previews in action.

We have added a Manager “Karen Key” and an Employee “Billy Mills”. We entered the names of each staff member in the `name` field, a short sentence about their position in the `job_description` field, and the image path in the `profile_picture` field.

We have also added two blank objects to the array, one using the Manager option and one using the Employee option.

Here is how the array looks in the sidebar of the Content Editor.

Our blank array items look a little different. The text and subtext for each card match the fallback strings we configured for these options. Also, with no image path selected, the cards have fallen back to the icons we configured.

These fallback values also appear in the dropdown menu or [pop-up modal](/documentation/articles/create-a-structure/#create-a-structures-modal) when selecting an option for new array items. In the image above, the dropdown shows the value of `preview.icon` and `preview.text`. In the image below, we see the value of `preview.icon`, `preview.text`, and `preview.subtext`, when the array style is switched to a pop-up modal.
