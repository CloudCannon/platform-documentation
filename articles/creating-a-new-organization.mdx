  **Permissions required**

  Anyone can create a new Organization on CloudCannon. When you create a new Organization, CloudCannon will automatically add you to the Owners [Default Permission Group](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/) for that Org.
</comp.Notice>

An Organization is the highest level of content management on CloudCannon, containing all your websites, team members, and resources in CloudCannon. When you sign up, CloudCannon will automatically create an *Organization* for you.

You can [join multiple Organizations](/documentation/articles/join-or-leave-an-organization/) by invitation, or create as many Organizations as you require.

To create a new Organization:

1. Click on your *Name* or *Avatar* at the bottom of the *App Sidebar* to open the *Account Menu* and select the *Organizations* option. CloudCannon will open the *Organizations Browser*.
2. Click the *\+ Create organization* button on the right of your *Organization Browser Controls*. CloudCannon will open the *Create your Organization* page.
3. Enter a name for your Organization in the *Organization name* text field.
4. Click the *Create Organization* button.

CloudCannon will forward you to the *Organization Home* page for your new Organization.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Create-Organization-Page" alt="A screenshot of the Create your Organization page shows the Organization name text field." title="The Create your Organization page" type="screenshot"/>

Your new Organization will now appear in the *Organizations Browser*, which you can use to switch between Organizations at any time.
