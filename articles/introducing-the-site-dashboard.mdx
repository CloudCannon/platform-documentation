The dashboard has three main sections: Site Breakdown, Main Actions, and Recent Activity.

## Sections

### Site Breakdown

The site breakdown is a representation of the [Explore](/documentation/edit/interfaces/explore/) navigation. View options are inherited from the [explore settings](/documentation/edit/interfaces/explore/).

### Main Actions

Sits below the site breakdown and defaults to having a single action (View live site). You can configure two more options in the [client interface]( /documentation/articles/giving-clients-access-to-update-a-site/).

### Recent Activity

This is a summary of the last six actions to occur on the site. You can view a full history in the *Developer / Reports* section.

## Configuration

Set the default path to load when the **Update Home** action is clicked in the Dashboard.

This should be the URL of the page relative to your site's base URL.

This is set in your global configuration file.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json", "javascript"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
```
editor:
  default_path: /about/
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

Clicking the **Update Home** dashboard action loads the `default_path`. The example above loads `/about/` rather than the default `/`.
