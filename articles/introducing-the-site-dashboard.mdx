## Sections

### Site Breakdown

The site breakdown is a representation of the [Explore](/documentation/edit/interfaces/explore/) navigation. View options are inherited from the [explore settings](/documentation/edit/interfaces/explore/).

### Main Actions

Sits below the site breakdown and defaults to having a single action (View live site). You can configure two more options in the [client interface](/documentation/articles/giving-clients-access-to-update-a-site/).

### Recent Activity

This is a summary of the last six actions to occur on the site. You can view a full history in the *Developer / Reports* section.
