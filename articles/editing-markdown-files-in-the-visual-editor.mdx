<comp.Notice info_type="important">
This documentation page is applicable only to Sites using Unified Configuration.  
For sites that have not yet migrated to Unified Configuration, [view this page on our legacy documentation site](https://legacy.cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/editing-markdown-files-in-the-visual-editor/).
</comp.Notice>

You can edit markdown files in the Visual Editor using an in-place Rich Text editor embedded on your page.

To do so, add the `data-cms-edit="content"` attribute to the relevant element on your site. For example:

<comp.CodeBlock language="html" source="page.html">
```
<div data-cms-edit="content">
  {{ content }}
</div>
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

When encountering this attribute, CloudCannon will replace the children of the tagged element with the Content Editor, connected to the Markdown content of the opened file.
