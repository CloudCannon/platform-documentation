Customize content based on the location of the visitor.

CloudCannon Hosting automatically injects the viewer's country code into the HTML element's class as it is served.

You can enable geolocation in *Site Settings* / *Hosting*.

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/i18n-enable-geolocation.png" alt="Screenshot of Routing Interface" title="" type="screenshot"/>

If a viewer is from New Zealand, the class `country-nz` is added to look like this:

<comp.CodeBlock language="html" source="index.html">
```

<html class="country-nz">

```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Use CSS to show and hide elements:

<comp.CodeBlock language="css" source="styles.css">
```

.new-zealand-content {
  display: none;
}

.country-nz .new-zealand-content {
  display: block;
}

```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Run custom JavaScript based on country code:

<comp.CodeBlock language="javascript" source="script.js">
```

var htmlElement = document.documentElement,
  countryClass = htmlElement.className.match(/\bcountry\-([a-z0-9]{2})\b/);

if (countryClass) {
  console.log(countryClass[1]); // logs your country code - check your console
} else {
  console.log("No country found :(");
}

```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Here are the country codes supported:

<comp.CodeBlock language="yaml" source="countries.yml">
```
