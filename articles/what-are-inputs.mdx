An input is a field for adding structured data to your files. Each input corresponds to a field in your front matter or data file, providing an editing interface for those values. An input could be a text field for a description of your file, a date field for the day a blog was published, a select field with a list of predefined tags for your content, or more.

Inputs appear in the [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/the-data-editor/) and the sidebar and data panels of the [Content](/documentation/articles/the-content-editor/) and [Visual Editors](/documentation/articles/the-visual-editor/). You can [configure inputs](/documentation/articles/configure-your-inputs/) for your data files or the front matter of markup files anywhere in the [configuration cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/).

All inputs have four main components: the label, comment, context, and type.

The label of an input adds a title in bold at the top of the input. If you don’t configure a label for your input, CloudCannon will use the key name.

You can add extra information to your inputs using comments and context, such as instructions for your team members on how to use an input. A comment is a subtitle underneath the input label and the context is a gray dropdown underneath the input field. You can use a limited selection of Markdown formatting for comments and context: links, headings (context only), bold, italic, subscript, superscript, and inline code.

CloudCannon supports twelve types of input:

* [Boolean](/documentation/articles/boolean-inputs/) — Define a true or false value using a checkbox or a switch.
* [Code](/documentation/articles/code-inputs/) — Add a code editor.
* [Color](/documentation/articles/color-inputs/) — Add a color using a color picker with spectrum and transparency controls.
* [Date and Time](/documentation/articles/date-and-time-inputs/) — Define a date and/or time.
* [File](/documentation/articles/file-inputs/) — Upload a file, such as an image or a document.
* [Number](/documentation/articles/number-inputs/) — Add a number using a text box or a range slider.
* [Object](/documentation/articles/object-inputs/) — Select an object containing predefined inputs.
* [Array](/documentation/articles/array-inputs/) — Create a list of objects or arrays, each containing predefined inputs.
* [Select and Multiselect](/documentation/articles/select-and-multiselect-inputs/) — Select one or more options from a predefined list.
* [Text](/documentation/articles/text-inputs/) — Write plain text content.
* [Rich text](/documentation/articles/rich-text-inputs/) — Write markup content in HTML or Markdown and format it with a configurable WYSIWYG toolbar.
* [URL](/documentation/articles/url-inputs/) — Add a relative or absolute URL.

For more information on each input type, including a list of all keys available for configuring each input, please read our documentation on each input type.

## Default behavior for unconfigured inputs

Normally, CloudCannon uses the the input type to determine which default options to apply to an input. However, if you have not configured an input, in some cases CloudCannon can still detect your inputs based on the value and key name.

The value of an unconfigured input will help CloudCannon determine its type. For example, CloudCannon will interpret a `true` or `false` value as a [Boolean input](/documentation/articles/boolean-inputs/), and a string value as a [Text input](/documentation/articles/text-inputs/).

Each input type also has a naming convention that allows CloudCannon to determine the input type by the key name. For example, CloudCannon will interpret any key name ending in `_color` or `_hex` as a [Color input](/documentation/articles/color-inputs/), and any key name ending in `_path` or `_image` as a [File input](/documentation/articles/file-inputs/). Each input type has multiple naming conventions.

You can add inputs to your files without the need for configuration. This behavior is convenient if you have simple inputs, or do not want to configure inputs. It is also beneficial for new websites on CloudCannon.

The default input behavior may not be right for you if:

* Your value or key name is not specific enough for CloudCannon to determine the input type.
* You want to customize the user experience for your input.

You can overcome these limitations by [configuring inputs](/documentation/articles/configure-your-inputs/) for your files.
