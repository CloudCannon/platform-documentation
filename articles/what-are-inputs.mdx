An input is a field for adding structured data to your files. An input could be a text field for a description of your file, a date field for the day a blog was published, a select field with a list of predefined tags for your content, or more.

Inputs appear in the [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/the-data-editor/) and the sidebar and data panels of the [Content](/documentation/articles/the-content-editor/) and [Visual Editors](/documentation/articles/the-visual-editor/). You can configure inputs for your data files or the front matter of markup files.

All inputs have four main components: the label, comment, context, and type.

The label of an input adds a title in bold at the top of the input. If you don’t configure a label for your input, CloudCannon will use the key name.

You can add extra information to your inputs using comments and context, such as instructions for your team members on how to use an input. A comment is a subtitle underneath the input label and the context is a gray dropdown underneath the input field. You can use a limited selection of Markdown formatting for comments and context: links, headings (context only), bold, italic, subscript, superscript, and inline code.

CloudCannon supports twelve types of input:

* [Text](/documentation/articles/text-inputs/) — Write plain text content.
* [Rich text](/documentation/articles/rich-text-inputs/) — Write markup content in HTML or Markdown and format it with a configurable WYSIWYG toolbar.
* [URL](/documentation/articles/url-inputs/) — Add a relative or absolute URL.
* [File](/documentation/articles/file-inputs/) — Upload a file, such as an image or a document.
* [Select and Multiselect](/documentation/articles/select-and-multiselect-inputs/) — Select one or more options from a predefined list.
* [Boolean](/documentation/articles/boolean-inputs/) — Define a true or false value using a checkbox or a switch.
* [Code](/documentation/articles/code-inputs/) — Add a code editor.
* [Color](/documentation/articles/color-inputs/) — Add a color using a color picker with spectrum and transparency controls.
* [Number](/documentation/articles/number-inputs/) — Add a number using a text box or a range slider.
* [Date and Time](/documentation/articles/date-and-time-inputs/) — Define a date and/or time.
* [Object](/documentation/articles/object-inputs/) — Select an object containing predefined inputs.
* [Array](/documentation/articles/array-inputs/) — Create a list of objects or arrays, each containing predefined inputs.

You can [configure your inputs](/documentation/articles/configure-your-inputs/) anywhere in the [configuration cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/).

For more information on each input type, including a list of all keys available for configuring each input, please read our documentation on each input type.
