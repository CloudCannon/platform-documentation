Your Site Navigation is on the left of your CloudCannon app and contains commonly used tools. Your Site Navigation appears whenever you open a Site in CloudCannon.

## Navigation Sections

### Navigation Header

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/editing/navigation/2024-10/CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Navigation-Header.png" alt="A screenshot of the Site Navigation header shows the projects dropdown, SIte information, avatars, and other tools." title="The Site Navigation header" type="ui-snippet"/>

The *Site Navigation* Header contains basic information about your Site, which team members are using your Site, and tools to save, publish, and view your Site.

* **Projects dropdown** — If your Site is part of a [Project](/documentation/articles/create-a-project/), the *Projects dropdown* shows you which Project your Site belongs to and which Sites (if any) it publishes to.
* **Site icon, Site name, and branch name** — These are your basic Site details, so you know which Site you are editing.
* **Avatars** — The avatars for any [team members](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-team-member/) active on your Site. Clicking on an avatar will show a list of files they have open, with an eye icon for files they are *Viewing* and a pencil for *Editing*.
* **The Save button** — Opens the *Review your changes* modal and allows you to [save changes](/documentation/articles/save-your-changes/) to your Git repository.
* **The Publish button** — If your Site has a [Publish Branch](/documentation/articles/connect-a-publish-branch/), this button allows you to create a Pull Request or immediately merge your changes from this Site to any Sites it publishes to.
* **The Live site preview button** — Opens your [Testing Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-testing-domain/) or your [Custom Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/), if you have one.

Some of these sections may not appear depending on your Site's configuration. For example,

The *Save* and *Publish* buttons sometimes have red notification bubbles in the top right. On the *Save* button, this indicates the number of files with unsaved changes. On the *Publish* button, the upwards arrow and number indicate how many commits this Site is ahead of your Publish Branch, while the downwards arrow and number indicate how many commits this Site is behind your Publish Branch. For more information, please read our documentation on [saving your changes](/documentation/articles/save-your-changes/) and [updating from a Publish Branch](/documentation/articles/update-from-a-publish-branch/).
