Connecting GitLab allows you to work on your websites locally and have the changes sync to CloudCannon. File changes made on CloudCannon also get synced back to GitLab.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  To connect to a *self-hosted GitLab* repository instead, follow the instructions listed for [Self-Hosted GitLab](/documentation/articles/connecting-a-self-hosted-gitlab-repository-as-your-source/).
</comp.Notice>

To connect a GitLab repository and start syncing files, follow these instructions:

1. Go to *Site Settings* / *Source Syncing*
2. Select **GitLab repository**
3. Click **Authenticate**

This redirects you to GitLab. Log in and authorize CloudCannon access to your GitLab account.
You'll be redirected back to CloudCannon to pick a repository to connect. If you don't have one for this website, create a new one in GitLab and refresh this page.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Any existing files on your website will be replaced with the contents of the selected repository. Click **Backup and Sync** to continue, or exit the page to cancel the process.
</comp.Notice>

GitLab is now connected. Changes you push to the Git repository are pulled in by CloudCannon. Any changes made on CloudCannon are automatically committed and pushed.
