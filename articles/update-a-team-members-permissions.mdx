## Add to a Permission Group

Adding a team member to a Permission Group will increase their permissions in your Organization.

Permission Groups are always additive. In other words, permissions from one group do not negate permissions from another. CloudCannon will allow an action if a team member has permission to do so from at least one source. For more information about permissions, read our documentation on [Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-permission-groups/) and our [permissions reference](/documentation/articles/permissions-reference/) documentation.

There are three ways to add a team member to a Permission Group. The best method to use will depend on whether you want to:

* Add multiple team members to multiple Permission Groups.
* Add a specific team member to multiple Permission Groups.
* Add multiple team members to a specific Permission Group.

### Add multiple team members to multiple Permission Groups

To add a team member to a Permission Group:

1. Navigate to the *Team* page under *Org settings*.
2. Under the *Members* tab, click the *\+ Add members* button on the right to open the *Invite team members to your Organization* modal.
3. Enter the name of the team member(s) you want to update the permissions of.
4. Enter the Permission Group(s) to which you want to add these team members. You must select at least one.
5. Click the *Add member(s)* button.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  You can use the *Invite team members to your Organization* modal to update the permissions of existing team members at the same time as inviting new users.
</comp.Notice>

### Add a specific team member to a Permission Group

To add a specific team member to one or more Permission Groups:

1. Navigate to the *Team* page under *Org settings*.
2. Under the *Members* tab, click on the member you want to update the permissions of. This will open their *Team member* page.
3. Click the *\+ Add group* button on the right to open the *Add to groups* modal.
4. Enter the Permission Group(s) to which you want to add this team member.
5. Click the *Add to group(s)* button.

## Remove from a Permission Group

Removing a team member from a Permission Group will decrease the permissions they have in your Organization.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Each team member in your Organization must be a member of at least one Permission Group. If you remove a team member from the last Permission Group they were a member of, this action will also remove them from your Organization.
</comp.Notice>

There are two ways to remove a team member from a Permission Group. The best method to use will depend on whether you want to:

* Remove a specific team member from multiple Permission Groups.
* Remove multiple team members from a specific Permission Group.

### Remove a specific team member from Permission Groups

To remove a specific team member from one or more Permission Groups:

1. Navigate to the *Team* page under *Org settings*.
2. Under the *Members* tab, click on the member you want to update the permissions of. This will open their *Team member* page.
3. Identify the Permission Group from which you want to remove this team member and click on the *Context menu*.
4. Select the *Remove from Group* option from the *Context menu* dropdown.
5. Confirm that you want to remove this team member from this group by clicking the *Remove from Group* button in the confirmation modal.
