Select and Multiselect inputs are editing interfaces for selecting values from predefined lists. You can use these inputs in the Data Editor, Content Editor, or Visual Editor to edit structured data in data files or front matter.

There are four types of Select and Multiselect inputs:

* Select
* Multiselect
* Choice
* Multichoice

## Select input types

### Select

The Select input provides an editing interface for data with multiple predefined options. Only one value is allowed at a time. In the Data Editor, predefined options appear in a dropdown menu.

This input has the same function as a Choice input but a different appearance.

### Multiselect

The Multiselect input provides an editing interface for data with multiple predefined options. Several values are allowed at a time. In the Data Editor, predefined options appear in a dropdown menu.

### Input validation

Your Select or Multiselect inputs may have input validation, which requires the input value to meet predefined criteria before you can save your changes. CloudCannon will warn you if your input value is invalid and provide directions on how to fix it.

CloudCannon will show a red `*` next to the name of your Select or Multiselect inputs if a value is required.
