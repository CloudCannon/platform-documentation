<comp.Notice info_type="permissions">
  **Permissions required**

  Members of the Owners or Developers [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/), or [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/) with the `base-domain:create` permission, can connect Custom Domains to an Organization.
</comp.Notice>

A Custom Domain is a unique address used to identify a website (e.g., [cloudcannon.com](https://cloudcannon.com/)). Once you have purchased a domain from a Domain Registrar, you can connect that Custom Domain to CloudCannon and use it on any Site in your Organization.

After you have connect a Custom Domain to your Organization, you can manage your Custom Domain settings and [add your Custom Domain to a Site](/documentation/articles/add-a-custom-domain-to-your-site/).

These instructions assume that you want to host your website through CloudCannon and already know which DNS provider (i.e., CloudCannon or External) you want to use for your Custom Domain. For more information, please read our documentation on [web hosting](/documentation/articles/what-is-web-hosting/) and [DNS](/documentation/articles/what-is-dns/) in general.

There are two ways to connect a Custom Domain to your Organization: from the *Domains* *browser*, or from the *Custom Domain* page under your *Site Settings*.

## Connect a domain from your *Domains browser*

To connect a Custom Domain from the *Domains browser*:

1. Log in to CloudCannon and select the Organization to which you want to connect the Custom Domain.
2. Click the *Domains* button in the *App Sidebar*.  CloudCannon will open the *Domains browser*.
3. Click the *\+ Connect a Domain* button in the top right of the *Domains browser*. CloudCannon will open the *Connect a Domain* page.
4. Enter your Custom Domain name in the *Base Domain* text input.
5. Select the *CloudCannon DNS* or *External DNS* option under the *DNS Provider* radio buttons.
6. Click the *Connect Domain* button.

CloudCannon will connect the Custom Domain to your Organization and open the *Domain* page for this Custom Domain.
