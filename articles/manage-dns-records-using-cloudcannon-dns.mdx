[DNS records](/documentation/articles/what-is-dns/#what-are-dns-records) are instructions for a Domain Name managed by an authoritative nameserver. By enabling CloudCannon DNS, you allow CloudCannon's servers to manage your DNS records.

To add a DNS record:

1. Navigate to the *Domain browser* by clicking the globe icon in your *App Navigation*.
2. Select the domain for which you want to configure DNS.
3. Under the *Domain Settings* tab, open the *DNS* section.
4. Click the *\+ Add Record* button.
5. In the *Add DNS record* modal, use the *Type* dropdown to select the type of record. Valid options include *A*, *AAAA*, *CNAME*, *MX*, *SPF*, *SRV*, and *TXT*.
6. CloudCannon will update the fields in the *Add DNS record* modal depending on the record type. Enter the details for your DNS record.
7. When you are happy with your record details, click the *Add Record* button.

CloudCannon will add the DNS record to your DNS settings.
