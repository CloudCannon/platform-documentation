A “build” is when CloudCannon converts all your Site files into a single, functional program. Building your Site in CloudCannon enables you to check all your files function well together, preview screenshots of your pages in the [Collection](/documentation/articles/define-your-collections/) browser, view a preview of your Site live on a [Test domain](/documentation/articles/viewing-your-site-on-a-testing-domain/), and use the [Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/the-visual-editor/) for an intuitive editing experience.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Building is an optional step. If your Site is Dynamic, or you only want to use CloudCannon as a CMS for your git repository, you don’t need to build. For more information, please read our guide on using [CloudCannon in Headless Mode](/documentation/guides/headless-starter-guide/introduction/).
