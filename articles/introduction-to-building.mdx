A “build” is when CloudCannon converts all your Site files into a single, functional program. Building your Site in CloudCannon enables you to check all your files function well together, preview screenshots of your pages in the [Collection](/documentation/articles/define-your-collections/) browser, view a preview of your Site live on a [Test domain](/documentation/articles/viewing-your-site-on-a-testing-domain/), and use the [Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/the-visual-editor/) for an intuitive editing experience.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Building is an optional step. If your Site is Dynamic, or you only want to use CloudCannon as a CMS for your git repository, you don’t need to build. For more information, please read our guide on using [CloudCannon in Headless Mode](/documentation/guides/headless-starter-guide/introduction/).
</comp.Notice>

In the Building section of our documentation, we cover:

* [What is a Site build?](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-site-build/) — Learn about the basics of Site building including when to build, how to trigger a build, and how to read build logs.
* Configuring your builds — Set up and manage your build settings.
* Extending your builds — x
* Scheduling your builds — Learn how to schedule builds [manually](/documentation/articles/scheduling-your-builds-manually/) or [automatically](/documentation/articles/scheduling-your-next-build-automatically/).
* The default build pipeline — x
* Site Mounting — x
* Headless Mode — x
* Coupled Config — x

Let’s briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## Configuring your builds

CloudCannon needs to know a few details about your Site in order to build it, such as which SSG you are using and what commands to run. You can manage these settings on the *Site Details* and *Build Configuration* pages under *Site Settings*.

For a more in-depth explanation of build configuration, including how to set up your first build, manage your build settings, or lock builds, please read our documentation:

* [Configure your first build](/documentation/articles/configure-your-first-build/)
* [Select your SSG](/documentation/articles/select-your-ssg/)
* [Configure your command line options](/documentation/articles/configure-your-command-line-options/)
* [Configure your environment variables](/documentation/articles/configure-your-environment-variables/)
* [Pin your dependency version](/documentation/articles/pin-your-dependency-version/)
* [Lock builds for your Site](/documentation/articles/lock-builds-for-your-site/)
