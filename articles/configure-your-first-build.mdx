Building on CloudCannon is optional; however, it is required for web hosting and visual editing.

To build through CloudCannon, you must configure any command line options and build system options required for your Site. You can do this by starting the *Set up Visual Editing* or *Host your website on the Internet* in-app guides.

To configure your first Site build:

1. Start the *Set up Visual Editing* or *Host your website on the Internet* in-app guide by navigating to the *Guides* tab of your *Site Dashboard*.
2. On the *Summary* tab of your *Site Dashboard*, click the *Configure your build* button under the *Configure your Site's build settings* task. CloudCannon will open the *Configure your build* modal.
3. Enter your *Command line options* and *Build system options.* You can click on CloudCannon's suggested values to use them in your configuration.
4. Click the *Update Configuration and Build* button.

CloudCannon will attempt to build your Site. Once the build is successful, you can mark the *Configure your Site's build settings* task as complete.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p>CloudCannon will suggest options based on your SSG and the contents of your Site files.</p>
</comp.Notice>

You can edit your build configuration at any time on the *Configuration* page under *Site Settings*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Settings-Configuration-Page" alt="A screenshot of the Build Configuration page shows blue boxes containing CloudCannon's suggestions for your command line options." title="The Build Configuration page"/>

You can monitor the outcome of your first build on the *Builds* tab of your *Site Dashboard*.

After a successful first build, CloudCannon will build your Site every time it syncs an update from your repository, or when you [choose to trigger a build](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-site-build/#starting-a-build). This ensures your most recent content is always live.

If your build fails for any reason, CloudCannon will suggest common solutions to troubleshoot your build. For assistance configuring your builds, please contact our friendly [support team](/support/).
