Sites can be configured to build using Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy, Next.js, Nuxt, Gatsby, SvelteKit, Astro, MkDocs, Static, or Custom.

When [connecting your site](/documentation/articles/connecting-your-first-site/), you will be asked to select your SSG to build with. You can change this at any time by:

1. Navigating to your site's settings
2. Navigating to *Builds* / *Build*
3. Selecting your SSG from the dropdown, then clicking **Update Configuration** at the bottom of the page

## Build Step

Here you can find what commands CloudCannon uses to build your sites. Learn more about [extending your build process with hooks](/documentation/articles/extending-your-build-process-with-hooks/).

<comp.Conditional ssgs={["Jekyll"]}>
  Jekyll is one of the first popular SSGs. Learn how you can customize Jekyll and the build environment to your needs.

  Sites **without** a `Gemfile` are built with:

  <comp.CodeBlock language="shell" source="shell">
  ```
  jekyll build
  ```
  </comp.CodeBlock>

  Sites **with** a `Gemfile` are built with:

  <comp.CodeBlock language="shell" source="shell">
  ```
  bundle install
  bundle exec jekyll build
  ```
  </comp.CodeBlock>

  These commands are run in the root folder of your site.

  <comp.Notice info_type="info">
    If your `Gemfile` isnâ€™t in the root folder, set the `BUNDLE_GEMFILE` [environment variable](/documentation/build/setup/environments/) to tell the Bundler where to find it. Setting this requires that your gems are specified in the `_config.yml` file.
  </comp.Notice>
</comp.Conditional>

<comp.Conditional ssgs={["Hugo"]}>
  Hugo is a popular SSG built using Golang.

  Hugo sites are built with:

  <comp.CodeBlock language="shell" source="shell">
  ```
  hugo
  ```
  </comp.CodeBlock>
</comp.Conditional>

<comp.Conditional ssgs={["Eleventy"]}>
  Eleventy (or 11ty) is a popular static site generator built with Node.js.

  Eleventy sites are built with:

  <comp.CodeBlock language="shell" source="shell">
  ```
  npx @11ty/eleventy
  ```
  </comp.CodeBlock>
</comp.Conditional>

<comp.Conditional ssgs={["Static"]}>
  Static is the most basic SSG option available on CloudCannon.

  Files are copied to the live site as-is. CloudCannon performs optimizations and processes static-specific hosting features on the files.
</comp.Conditional>

<comp.Conditional not_ssgs={["Jekyll", "Eleventy", "Hugo", "Static"]}>
  CloudCannon provides a build command for each known SSG, and this can be changed to suit your build. The build command is set in the build configuration when you select an SSG.
</comp.Conditional>
