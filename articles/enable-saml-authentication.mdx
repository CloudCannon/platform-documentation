<comp.Notice info_type="pricing">
  **This feature is available on our Enterprise plan.**

  This feature is currently limited to customers on our [Enterprise plan](/pricing/). Want to chat about whether this feature is right for you? Our support team is always <a href="mailto:success@cloudcannon.com?subject=A%20question%20about%20SSO%2FSAML" rel="noreferrer">happy to hear from you</a>.

  This feature is only available for Sites [hosted through CloudCannon](/documentation/articles/what-is-web-hosting/#hosting-on-cloud-cannon). If you host your Site externally, or use CloudCannon in [Headless Mode](/documentation/articles/what-is-headless-mode/), this feature will not work.
</comp.Notice>

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication requires visitors to your Site to log in with a third-party Single Sign-On ([SSO](/documentation/articles/what-is-sso-saml/)) account. SSO/SAML provides a way to authenticate a visitor's identity through an external application and communicate that authentication to your Site hosted on CloudCannon.

We recommend SAML authentication for websites primarily used by internal teams.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  To enable SAML authentication for your Site you must have a SAML certificate from an Identity Provider of your choice (e.g., Google sign in). Visitors to your Site must have an account with your Identity Provider to access your content.
</comp.Notice>

To enable user account authentication for your Site:

1. Navigate to the *Authentication* page under *Site Settings*.
2. Click on the *Authentication method* dropdown and select the *SAML* option.
3. Click the *Switch to SAML authentication* button to confirm your choice.
4. Enter your SAML certificate details in the text fields for *SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP)*, *Issuer Suffix*, and *X.509 Certificate*. Alternatively, you can add your certificate details automatically by clicking the *Fill cert using XML Metadata* button and uploading the XML file from your Identity Provider.
5. Click the *Update SAML Configuration* button.

CloudCannon will redirect visitors to your SSO login page.

To disable SAML authentication, click on the *Authentication method* dropdown, select the *None* option, and then click the *Switch to no authentication* button to confirm your choice.

CloudCannon uses cookies to determine whether a visitor is logged in (i.e., authenticated). Visitors can log out using the log-out link. For more information, please read our documentation on [allowing authenticated users to log out](/documentation/articles/allow-authenticated-users-to-log-out/).
