An Array input is an editing interface for lists of inputs or input groups. You can use this input in the Data Editor, Content Editor, or Visual Editor to edit structured data in data files or front matter. Array inputs can contain nested inputs of any type, including other Arrays and Objects. There is no limit to how many nested layers you can create within an Array.

There is only one type of Array input:

* Array

## Array input types

### Array

The Array input provides a user interface for lists of inputs or input groups. Each item in an Array is sometimes called an "entry". Entries in an Array can be a single value, an input, or an Object containing several inputs. Array inputs appear as a series of cards in the Data Editor or sidebar of the Visual or Content Editor.

For entries that use a key name (i.e., Objects, Arrays, or single inputs), the card will preview some of the content within the key. This can include images, strings, and key names. You can configure the preview settings for these cards.

Simpler entries with no key name, such as text, number, or boolean values, do not use cards. Instead, they appear as editable inline fields.

Array inputs can contain a mixture of inline fields and cards simultaneously.

You can reorder, clone, add, and delete new entries in the list using the *Context menu*. You can also add new entries using the *\+ Add* button below the Array â€” the text on this button will differ depending on the key name of your Array input.

Adding a new entry to an Array input will clone the last entry in the Array.

When you click on a card in the Array, it will open to show the nested inputs within that Array entry. The *Back* button at the top of the entry will return you to the parent scope.

## Array input appearance and behavior

You can customize the label, comment, documentation link, and context box for all inputs regardless of type.

## Misconfigured Array inputs

You will see an orange warning box if your Array input is misconfigured.

Array inputs are misconfigured if:

* The value is not an array of strings, numbers, booleans, or keys.

For more information on how to fix a misconfigured Array input, please read our developer documentation on [configuring an Object input](/documentation/articles/configure-an-array-input/).
