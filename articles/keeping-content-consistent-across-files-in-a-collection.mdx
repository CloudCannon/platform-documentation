When you edit a file in a collection with a schema defined, the front matter or data is updated to match the configured schema. This allows you to keep your files consistent across a collection as they are edited by adding, removing, or reordering inputs in the schema file.

**[Follow these steps to create and configure a schema](/documentation/articles/creating-collection-schemas/) for your collection.**

Hereâ€™s an example schema file and the required configuration for a `posts` collection:

<comp.CodeBlock language="markdown" source="schemas/post.md">
```
---
title:
author:
image:
---
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json", "javascript"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
```
collections_config:
  posts:
    schemas:
      default:
        path: schemas/post.md
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Existing files are not processed before being loaded into the editor if a schema is not configured on the collection.
</comp.Notice>

Since multiple schemas can be defined, the `_schema` field inside the file being edited is used to find the correct one. The `_schema` field is automatically added when creating files for a collection with schemas within CloudCannon.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  The `default` schema is used if `_schema` does not exist. You can change the field from `_schema` with the `schema_key` option when [defining your collections](/documentation/articles/defining-your-collections/).
</comp.Notice>

### Example
In this example, we have the schema defined above for the `posts` collection, and we have the following post that was created when the schema had different fields:

<comp.CodeBlock language="markdown" source="content/posts/my-existing-post.md ">
```
---
_schema: default
title: My post
category: news
---
This is the content of my post!
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

After editing this post there are these changes:

1. `category` was removed
2. `author` and `image` were added
3. All inputs were reordered to match the schema

<comp.CodeBlock language="markdown" source="content/posts/my-existing-post.md ">
```
---
_schema: default
title: My updated post
author: /authors/jane
image: /images/posts/header.png
---
This is the updated content of my post!
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  You can control whether inputs are reordered, removed and/or hidden with the `reorder_inputs`, `remove_empty_inputs` and `hide_extra_inputs` [schema options](/documentation/articles/creating-collection-schemas/#options).
</comp.Notice>
