  **This feature is limited to higher pricing plans.**

  This feature is available to customers on our [Enterprise plan](/pricing/). Want to chat about whether this feature is right for you? Our support team is always <a href="mailto:success@cloudcannon.com?subject=A%20question%20about%20enforced%20MFA" rel="noreferrer">happy to hear from you</a>.
</comp.Notice>

Requiring your [team members](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-team-member/) to use [multi-factor authentication](/documentation/articles/what-is-multi-factor-authentication/) on CloudCannon can add an extra layer of security to your [Organization](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-organization/).

Only members of the Owners [Permission Group](/documentation/articles/what-are-permission-groups/) can enforce multi-factor authentication for an Organization.

To enforce multi-factor authentication for your CloudCannon Organization:

1. Log in to CloudCannon.
2. Navigate to the *Multi-factor Authentication* page under *Org Settings.*
3. Check the *Require multi-factor authentication (MFA)* check box.
4. Enter the date after which CloudCannon will require multi-factor authentication to view your Organization.
5. Click the *Update* button.

After the specified date, CloudCannon will require team members in your Organization to have [multi-factor authentication enabled](/documentation/articles/enable-multi-factor-authentication/) to view your Organization and Sites. You can update the date and disable enforced multi-factor authentication at any time.

As the date approaches, your team members will see a warning banner, informing them that your Organization will soon require multi-factor authentication.

If a team member has not enabled multi-factor authentication before that date, they can log in to CloudCannon but cannot access your Organization.

A team member can restore access to your Organization by [enabling multi-factor authentication](/documentation/articles/enable-multi-factor-authentication/) on their CloudCannon account.

You can view which team members have multi-factor authentication enabled on the *Team* page under *Org Settings*.
