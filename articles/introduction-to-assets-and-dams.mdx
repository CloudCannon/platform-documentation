Assets are often the most visually important part of your site. They are also usually the largest. Storing assets in a Git repository can quickly become an issue. Git repositories usually max out around 2GB of storage. The size and number of files can also contribute to a slower build. It is a good idea to investigate an alternative storage for assets. To help, CloudCannon can seamlessly connect to your external asset storage. This allows your editors to upload/choose images from any editing interface.

External asset storage is often referred to as a DAM (Digital Asset Manager) and they can do a lot more than just store the files. DAMs can attach extra metadata to your assets, add complex sorting and even do handy image transformations on the fly. Alternatively, they can just store your assets and serve them from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

CloudCannon integrates with five DAMs at the moment:

1. Cloudinary
2. S3
3. Tenovos
4. Azure Blob Storage
5. Google Cloud Storage

If you have a need for another DAM on CloudCannon, please reach out to support. We plan to add more in the future. Knowing we can help our customers could speed things up.
