Routing determines what content is returned to a visitor's browser when they request a URL. Custom routing allows you to extend the default behavior.

This article covers all keys available in CloudCannon for configuring your `routing.json` file. For more information, please read our documentation on [Routing](/documentation/articles/what-is-routing/) in general and [configuring custom routing](/documentation/articles/configure-custom-routing/).

All custom routing options are configured in the `routing.json` file in the `.cloudcannon` folder within your root directory.

## Custom redirects

These keys configure which URLs should be redirected.

<comp.DataReference>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="from" type_markdown="String">
    This key defines which URL should trigger this redirect rule. You must define this key for the redirect rule to function.

    Values can be a plain text string or REGEX (implemented by [re2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax)). URLs must always start with a `/` character. The REGEX functions `^` and `$` are implicit for each value of this key.

    This key has no default.

    <comp.Example>
      In this example, we want to redirect any users requesting the "/documentation/articles/choosing-your-ssg/" URL.

      <comp.MultiCodeBlock language="JSON" source="routing.json">
      ``````````
      {
        "routes": [
          {
            "from": "/documentation/articles/choosing-your-ssg/",
            "to": "/documentation/articles/select-your-ssg/",
            "status": 301
          }
        ]
      }
      ``````````
      </comp.MultiCodeBlock>
    </comp.Example>
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="to" type_markdown="String">
    This key defines which URL this redirect rule should send visitors to. You must define this key for the redirect rule to function.
  
    Values can be a plain text string or REGEX (implemented by [re2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax)). URLs must always start with a `/` character. The REGEX functions `^` and `$` are implicit for each value of this key.
  
    This key has no default.
  
    <comp.Example>
      In this example, we want to permanently redirect any users requesting the "/documentation/articles/choosing-your-ssg/" URL to "/documentation/articles/select-your-ssg/".
  
      <comp.MultiCodeBlock language="JSON" source="routing.json">
      ``````````
      {
        "routes": [
          {
            "from": "/documentation/articles/choosing-your-ssg/",
            "to": "/documentation/articles/select-your-ssg/",
            "status": 301
          }
        ]
      }
      ``````````
      </comp.MultiCodeBlock>
    </comp.Example>
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="status" type_markdown="Number">
    This key defines the [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) for a redirect rule.
  
    Values can be one of the following: `200`, `301`, `302`, `307`, `308`, `404`, or `410`.
    
    <comp.Notice info_type="info">
    When using 200, 404, and 410 status codes, `routes.to` must refer to a path on the same Site as `routes.from`, with the domain and protocol excluded.
    </comp.Notice>
  
    This key has no default.
  
    <comp.Example>
      In this example, we use the HTTP status `301` to indicate a permanent URL change.
  
      <comp.MultiCodeBlock language="JSON" source="routing.json">
      ``````````
      {
        "routes": [
          {
            "from": "/documentation/articles/choosing-your-ssg/",
            "to": "/documentation/articles/select-your-ssg/",
            "status": 301
          }
        ]
      }
      ``````````
      </comp.MultiCodeBlock>
    </comp.Example>
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="forced" type_markdown="Boolean">
    If forced is true (default), the redirect will take priority. If forced is false, the redirect will only run if no file exists on that route. This is useful if you have a greedy regex that you don't want interfering with existing routes.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="substitutions" type_markdown="Boolean">
    If substitutions is true (default), the `to` option can use regex parameters. If substitutions is false, the `to` option will be used as is. This is useful if you have a URL with characters that resemble the regex parameters.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
</comp.DataReference>

## Custom headers

These keys configure which services an HTTP request should target enables you to target the correct service for each request by specifying an HTTP header in the HTTP request.

<comp.DataReference>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="match" type_markdown="Regex (Implemented using [re2](https://github.com/uhop/node-re2))">
    A regular expression or plain string defining the url to match. The urls will always start with a / character. Implicit ^ and $ on each value.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="headers" type_markdown="Array">
    A list of header names and values to add to the matching request
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="headers.name" type_markdown="String">
    The name of the header to configure. Allowed values are

    * 'strict-transport-security'

    The value to return in the header
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
</comp.DataReference>
