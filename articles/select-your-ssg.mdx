When you first [create a Site](/documentation/guides/universal-starter-guide/), you need to confirm which which Static Site Generator (SSG) your Site uses (CloudCannon will attempt to predict your SSG based on your Site files). CloudCannon uses your SSG to determine how to handle your files and to provide suggestions for your [build configuration](/documentation/articles/configure-your-command-line-options/).

You may need to change which SSG your Site uses if CloudCannon has detected the incorrect one, or if you are rewriting your Site to use a different SSG.

To select your SSG:

1. Navigate to the *Details* page under *Site Settings*.
2. Click on the *Static Site Generator* dropdown and select the correct SSG option.
3. Click the *Update Site* button.
