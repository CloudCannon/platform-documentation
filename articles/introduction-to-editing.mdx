Editing on CloudCannon enables anyone on your team to contribute to your Git repository, regardless of technical expertise.

Traditional Content Management Systems (CMS) use databases to store your content. CloudCannon takes a different approach. By storing your content in files alongside your code, your content can benefit from the Git workflow (versioning, accountability, branching, etc.).

With CloudCannon, developers can configure their local environment just the way they want it, and non-developers can edit in the app with ease. You have control over how you configure your experience.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If this is your first time creating a site on CloudCannon, or you need a refresher, check out our [Starter Guides](/documentation/guides/) — we have one for every SSG we support!
</comp.Notice>

In the Editing section of our documentation, we cover:

* [The Global Configuration File](/documentation/articles/setting-global-configuration/) — create the file at the heart of CloudCannon customization.
* [Collections](/documentation/articles/defining-your-collections/) — groups of related files which form the start of any new site.
* App interfaces — learn how to configure your&nbsp;[site navigation](/documentation/articles/introducing-your-site-navigation/), [site dashboard](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-site-dashboard/), and [card previews](/documentation/articles/changing-how-cards-preview-your-data/).
* Editing interfaces — the [Visual](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-visual-editor/), [Content](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-content-editor/), [Data](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-data-editor/), and [Source](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-source-editor/) Editors.
* [Collaborative editing](/documentation/articles/collaborative-editing/) — cooperate on file changes with live editing.
* [Commit your changes](/documentation/articles/formatting-your-commit-messages/) —
* [Inputs](/documentation/articles/how-to-choose-what-input-is-used-in-the-data-editor/) —
* Structures —
* Snippets — create structured components in Markup using&nbsp;[Docusaurus](/documentation/articles/editing-with-docusaurus/), [Eleventy](/documentation/articles/editing-with-eleventy-shortcodes/), [Hugo Shortcodes](/documentation/articles/editing-with-hugo-shortcodes/), [MDX](/documentation/articles/editing-with-mdx-components/), or&nbsp;[Python Markdown](/documentation/articles/editing-with-python-markdown/).

Let’s briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## The Global Configuration File

Unlike a traditional CMS, you can configure CloudCannnon to suit your build tools and code. To maintain this flexibility, CloudCannon does not make assumptions about how you have configured your static site. CloudCannon will need you to clarify a few things about your SSG setup:

* Where are your content files stored? How are they grouped?
* Should CloudCannon allow the creation of new files? If so, how should they be created?
* Do you want your team to be able to edit those files? If so, what options should they have?

This setup information is stored in the CloudCannon global configuration file, saved in the root directory of your repository. Your configuration file can be one of several file types (i.e., `/cloudcannon.config.*`). When CloudCannon searches the root directory for your config file, it will use the first matching file from this list.

1. `cloudcannon.config.json`
2. `cloudcannon.config.yaml`
3. `cloudcannon.config.yml`
4. `cloudcannon.config.js`
5. `cloudcannon.config.cjs`

The global configuration file is the heart of your CloudCannon experience. If you don’t have one, CloudCannon will prompt you to create a global configuration file when you create a new site.

For a more in-depth explanation of the global configuration file, including how to create your configuration file, make a custom file path, or use our configuration GUI, read our documentation:

* [Create a global configuration file](/documentation/articles/setting-global-configuration/)

## What is a Collection?

A Collection is a group of related files with a repeated format stored in the same folder/path within your repository. Collections could be a folder of pages, blog posts, data files, or any other file type. You can edit your Collections by altering any file or adding more files. Collections are the starting point for any new site on CloudCannon.

Let’s cover an example. Your team publishes a weekly blog for your site. Each blog post is a single MDX file stored in the folder `content/posts` within your Git repository. CloudCannon makes creating a new blog post easy, especially for non-technical members of your team who may be hesitant to create new files in a Git repository. In CloudCannon, you can create new collection items with a click of a button, edit them in one of our editing interfaces, and see your existing files in a sortable, filterable browser. All your team’s changes will push back to your Git repository.

For a more in-depth explanation of Collections, including how to display Collections in the site navigation, control who can create new posts, and customize the default content, name, and editing interface of new files, read our documentation:

* [Define your collections](/documentation/articles/defining-your-collections/)
