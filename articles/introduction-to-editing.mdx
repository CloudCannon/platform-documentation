### The Data Editor

The Data Editor is a simple interface for managing structured data. Team members can edit input values without being overwhelmed by code syntax. CloudCannon uses the Data Editor in the Visual and Content Editors, where it functions as the sidebar to manage front matter content.

For a more in-depth explanation of the Data Editor, including the appropriate formatting for structured data in your SSG, read our documentation: Link.

For a more in-depth explanation of the Source Editor, including how to customize behavior and theme color, read our documentation:

* [Customizing inputs](/documentation/articles/how-to-choose-what-input-is-used-in-the-data-editor/)

### The Source Editor

The Source Editor is an in-browser code editor that is great for making minor changes to any of your files. CloudCannon automatically applies syntax highlighting to your files based on the file extension.

This editing interface does not require configuration and will work out of the box for any SSG. This editing interface is available to users with [Owner and Developer permission levels](/documentation/articles/managing-your-team-members/).

For a more in-depth explanation of the Source Editor, including how to customize behavior and theme color, read our documentation:

## Collaborative editing

Collaborative editing on CloudCannon enables your team to work together. While you edit a file, any number of team members can view your editing session live. You can switch who has control of the editing session to cooperate on content creation.

CloudCannon remembers who has contributed to a file. Any team member can review and commit file changes, see how long ago a user edited a file, and navigate to the file a user is editing or viewing by clicking on their avatar.
