<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  As of October 2024, this documentation is only applicable to Sites using Unified Configuration.
  For Sites that have not migrated to Unified Configuration, please read the documentation on our [non-unified documentation website](https://non-unified.cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/create-a-global-configuration-file/).
</comp.Notice>

<comp.Notice info_type="permissions">
  <p><strong>Permissions required</strong></p><p>Members of the Owners, Developers, or Technical Editors <a href="/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/">Default Permission Groups</a>, or <a href="/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/">Custom Permission Groups</a> with the <code>site:source-editor</code> permission, can see the <em>Getting Started</em> task list and create a CloudCannon Configuration File.</p>
</comp.Notice>

After syncing your *Site* files, creating your *CloudCannon Configuration File* should be the first thing you do. CloudCannon will prompt you to [create a configuration file](/documentation/articles/create-your-cloudcannon-configuration-file/) using the *Getting Started* task list on your *Site Dashboard*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Create-Config-File-Task" alt="A screenshot of the Create your CloudCannon Configuration File task from the Getting Started task list shows the Create my Configuration File button." title="The Create a Configuration File task" type="ui-snippet"/>

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  <p>The <em>Create your CloudCannon Configuration File</em> task or the <em>Getting Started with Editing</em> task list may not appear if you have the <em>Disable setup prompts</em> flag enabled. For more information, please read our documentation on <a href="/documentation/articles/what-are-flags/">Flags</a>.</p>
</comp.Notice>

At minimum, your *CloudCannon Configuration File* should define your *Static Site Generator (SSG)* and *Source Folder*.

To create your CloudCannon configuration file:

1. Click the *Create my Configuration File* button under the relevant task in your *Getting Started with Editing* in-app guide.CloudCannon will open the *Create my Configuration File* modal.
2. Select your Static Site Generator (SSG) using the *Static Site Generator* dropdown, or click on the suggested SSG to populate the dropdown.
3. Optional. If your source folder is nested in your repository (such as if you have a mono-repo), check the *Use custom source* box and enter the file path in the *Source Folder* text field.
4. Once you are happy with your configuration, click the *Create my Configuration File* button at the bottom of the modal.

CloudCannon will add `cloudcannon.config.yml` to the root of your repository with your initial configuration. If required, you can move your *Configuration File* out of the root of your Git repository and [define a custom Configuration File path](/documentation/articles/define-a-custom-configuration-file-path/).

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p>Don't forget to <a href="/documentation/articles/save-your-changes/">save your changes</a> to commit your <em>CloudCannon Configuration File</em> back to your Git repository!</p>
</comp.Notice>

You can edit your *CloudCannon Configuration File* using *Configuration Mode* or by finding the file in your *File Browser* and opening it in the Source Editor. For more information, please read out documentation on [Configuration Mode](/documentation/articles/what-is-configuration-mode/) in general or the [Source Editor](/documentation/articles/the-data-editor/).
