<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  As of October 2024, this documentation is only applicable to Sites using Unified Configuration.
  For Sites that have not migrated to Unified Configuration, please read the documentation on our [non-unified documentation website](https://non-unified.cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/create-a-global-configuration-file/).
</comp.Notice>

The [global configuration](/documentation/articles/create-a-global-configuration-file/) file is the heart of your integration with CloudCannon. You can create your configuration file locally or using the CloudCannon configuration GUI. When creating a new site, CloudCannon will guide you through creating a configuration file.

Here's an example file:

<comp.CodeBlock language="yaml" source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
```
# Use the given folder as the root for the site
# Collections will be relative to this path
source: src

# Determines the collections shown in the CMS sidebar
collections_config:
  people:
    path: 'content/people'
    name: Personnel
    _enabled_editors: ['data']
  posts:
    path: 'content/blog'
    # Configure inputs per collection
    _inputs:
      title:
        comment: Used for Blog SEO
  pages:
    path: 'content'
    glob:
      - "*.html"
    _enabled_editors: ['visual', 'data']

# Configure inputs across your site
_inputs:
  title:
    type: text
    comment: The title of your page

# Specify custom data for select and multiselect inputs
_select_data:
  colors:
    - Red
    - Green
    - Blue

# Generate data for select and multiselect inputs from data files
data_config:
  authors:
    path: data/authors.csv
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

### Options

Global configuration files have the following options available:

<comp.DataReference>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="base_url" type_markdown="String">
    The subpath your output files are mounted at.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="collections_config" type_markdown="Object">
    Contains definitions for your collections, the related sets of content files for your site grouped by folder. Entries are keyed by your collection key, and contain configuration specific to that collection. Read more about [defining your collections](/documentation/articles/define-your-collections/) and the available configuration.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="collection_groups" type_markdown="Array of objects">
    Controls which collections are displayed in the site navigation and how those collections are grouped. Defaults to splitting all available collections between *Pages*, *Blogging* and *Data* groups. Read more about [configuring your navigation section](/documentation/articles/configure-your-site-navigation/#configurable-navigation-section).
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="data_config" type_markdown="Object or boolean">
    Controls what data sets are available to populate [select and multiselect inputs](/documentation/articles/select-and-multiselect-inputs/).
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="file_config" type_markdown="Object">
    Provides scope to configure settings at a file level, without configuring a collection, or modifying files.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="editor" type_markdown="Object">
    Contains settings for the default editor actions on your site. The only available option is `default_path`, which [sets what URL the editor opens from the dashboard](/documentation/articles/introducing-your-site-navigation/).
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="paths" type_markdown="Object">
    Global paths to common folders. These are often automatically populated from your SSG, and not all paths are relevant to all SSGs. Each path is relative to `source`. The available keys are:

    * `uploads` for the default location of newly uploaded site files.
    * `dam_uploads` for the default location of newly uploaded [DAM](/documentation/articles/introduction-to-assets-and-dams/) files.
    * `static` for the location of statically copied assets.
    * `dam_static` for the location of statically copied assets for [DAM](/documentation/articles/introduction-to-assets-and-dams/) files.

    `uploads` and `dam_uploads` have a [number of dynamic placeholders available](/documentation/articles/adjusting-the-uploads-path/).
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="source" type_markdown="String">

  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="markdown" type_markdown="Object">
    Contains settings for various Markdown engines. See the [Configure your Markdown engine documentation](/documentation/articles/configure-your-markdown-engine/).

  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="commit_templates" type_markdown="Array of objects">
    Templates for commit messages when saving changes. See the [Configure your commit templates documentation](/documentation/articles/configure-your-commit-messages/).
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
</comp.DataReference>

### Configuration cascade options

Global configuration files are the base level for defining options in the [configuration cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/), allowing you to define these options here at a global scope.
