<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  As of October 2024, this documentation is only applicable to Sites using Unified Configuration.
  For Sites that have not migrated to Unified Configuration, please read the documentation on our [non-unified documentation website](https://non-unified.cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/create-a-global-configuration-file/).
</comp.Notice>

<comp.Notice info_type="permissions">
  <p><strong>Permissions required</strong></p><p>Members of the Owners, Developers, or Technical Editors <a href="/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/">Default Permission Groups</a>, or <a href="/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/">Custom Permission Groups</a> with the <code>site:source-editor</code> permission, can see the <em>Getting Started</em> task list and create a CloudCannon Configuration File.</p>
</comp.Notice>

After syncing your Site files, creating your [CloudCannon Configuration File](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-cloudcannon-configuration-file/) should be the first thing you do. CloudCannon will prompt you to create a configuration file using the *Getting Started* task list on your *Site Dashboard* if you don't have one, or if you have accidentally deleted it from your files.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  <p>The <em>Create your CloudCannon Configuration File</em> task or the <em>Getting Started</em> task list may not appear if you have the <em>Disable setup prompts</em> flag enabled. For more information, please read our documentation on <a href="/documentation/articles/what-are-flags/">Flags</a>.</p>
</comp.Notice>

At minimum, your CloudCannon configuration file should define your Static Site Generator (SSG) and Source Folder. When you create a new configuration file, CloudCannon will use the information found in your Site files to suggest values for these options.

To create your CloudCannon configuration file:

1. Click the *Create my Configuration File* button in your task list under the *Create your CloudCannon Configuration File* task. CloudCannon will open the *Create my Configuration File* modal.
2. Select your Static Site Generator (SSG) using the *Static Site Generator* dropdown, or click on the suggested SSG to populate the dropdown.
3. Enter your source file path in the *Source* text field. If this is the root of your repository, you can leave this field empty. However, if your Git repository uses a nested folder as the source for your Site, you must select the correct base path.
4. Once you are happy with your configuration, click the *Create my Configuration File* button at the bottom of the modal.

CloudCannon will add `cloudcannon.config.yml` to the root of your repository with your initial configuration.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p>Don't forget to save your changes to commit your CloudCannon Configuration File back to your Git repository!</p>
</comp.Notice>

You can open your CloudCannon Configuration File at any time using the [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/the-data-editor/) or the [Source Editor](/documentation/articles/the-data-editor/). To open your CloudCannon Configuration File, navigate to the *Editing* page under *Site Settings* and click the *Edit your configuration file* button.

You can also move your Configuration File out of the root of your Git repository and [define a custom configuration file path](/documentation/articles/define-a-custom-configuration-file-path/).

For more information about configuration options in your CloudCannon configuration file, please read our reference documentation for your [configuration file](/documentation/articles/configuration-file-reference/).
