Some CloudCannon configuration allows you to use **template strings**, which are a mixture of literal text and dynamic placeholders.

Placeholders are defined with `[ ]` and `{ }` brackets, and are replaced with data when the template is read by CloudCannon.

For example, template strings are used for:

* [Defining where new content files are created](/documentation/articles/set-the-path-for-new-files/)
* [Defining where new assets are uploaded](/documentation/articles/adjusting-the-uploads-path/)
* [Formatting your commit messages](/documentation/articles/configure-your-commit-messages/)
* [Configuring your card previews](/documentation/articles/configure-your-card-previews/)

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  See these articles for more specific information about which placeholders are best for these use cases.
</comp.Notice>

### Data placeholders

Data placeholders are populated from front matter or data values in the editor. They are surrounded with `{ }` brackets.

### Filters

Data placeholders support a number of filters. These are placed after a `|` character. Multiple filters can be applied in a sequence.

* `uppercase` transforms text to uppercase
* `lowercase` transforms text to lowercase
* `deburr` converts Latin-1 Supplement and Latin Extended-A letters to basic Latin letters and removes combining diacritical marks.
* `slugify` converts non-alphanumeric characters into hyphens, then collapses sequential hyphens, then removes leading/trailing and hyphens.
* `trim` removes leading and trailing whitespace

The following placeholders can only be applied to dates:

* `year` gets a 4-digit year from a date
* `month` gets a 2-digit month from a date
* `day` gets a 4-digit day from a date
* `time` gets the time from a date, in a 12-hour format (e.g. 12:30pm)
* `timezone` gets the timezone from a date
* `date_short` gets a short date format (e.g. 7/07/22)
* `date_medium` gets a medium date format (e.g. 7/07/2022)
* `date_long` gets a long date format (e.g. 7 June 2022)
* `date_full` gets a longer date format (e.g. Tuesday, 7 June 2022)
* `time` gets the time (e.g. 1:00pm)
* `time_short` gets a short time format (e.g. 1:00 pm)
* `time_medium` gets a medium time format (e.g. 1:00:00 pm)
* `time_long` gets a long time format (e.g. 1:00:00 pm NZDT)
* `time_full` gets a longer time format (e.g. 1:00:00 pm New Zealand Daylight Time)

Note that all the time and date filters format dates with the site's timezone and the user's locale.

Some filters can be given parameters for more flexibility. These are placed after a `=` after the filter name.

* `truncate` removes and extra characters beyond a specified number. For example, `{title|truncate=10}` will resolve to the first 10 characters of a message.
* `default` allows you to provide a fallback value, in case the data is empty
* `if` resolves to the data, if the parameter is "truthy"
* `unless` resolves to the data, if the parameter is "falsy"

### Examples

Let's assume the following data is being used:

<comp.CodeBlock language="yaml" source="">
```
timezone: 'Etc/UTC'
date: 2020-01-02
empty_value:
message: "Hello World"
draft: false
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Here are some examples of how this data could be transformed by different filters:

<comp.CodeBlock language="text" source="">
```
{date|day}-{date|month}-{date|year} {date|time} ({date|timezone})
// 01-02-2020 00:00am (Etc/UTC)

{message|uppercase|truncate=5}
// HELLO

{message|if=message}
// Hello World

{message|unless=empty_value}
// Hello World

{empty_value|default="Nothing here!"}
// Nothing here!

{"Unpublished"|if=draft|default="Published"}
// Published
```
</comp.CodeBlock>
