If you choose to [host your website](/documentation/articles/what-is-web-hosting/) through CloudCannon, you must select a DNS provider for your domain when you [connect a Custom Domain to your Organization](/documentation/articles/connect-a-custom-domain-to-your-organization/). A few factors determine which DNS provider is right for your Custom Domain. You can choose CloudCannon as your DNS provider or use a trusted third-party service (e.g., Cloudflare, DNSimple).

DNS providers manage and host the DNS records for your Custom Domain. For more information on DNS records, please read our documentation on [DNS](/documentation/articles/what-is-dns/) in general.

When you connect a Custom Domain, you must select either CloudCannon or external DNS.

* **CloudCannon DNS** — Manage your DNS records through CloudCannon (recommended).
* **External DNS** — Manage your DNS records through a trusted third-party service, while hosting your Site through CloudCannon.

Here are a few things to consider when selecting your DNS provider.

## CloudCannon DNS

CloudCannon DNS may be right for you if:

* You want to use an [auto-generated SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/add-an-auto-generated-ssl-certificate/).
* You want to manage all your domain settings in the same place you edit your content.

If you select CloudCannon DNS as your provider, you must [configure the nameservers]() on your Domain Registrar to match CloudCannon.

## External DNS

An external DNS provider may be right for you if:

* You have existing DNS infrastructure with a trusted third-party provider.
* You want to use a [custom SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/add-a-custom-ssl-certificate/).

If you select an external DNS provider for your Site hosted on CloudCannon, there are a few limitations you should consider.

* CloudCannon will not be able to dynamically load balance incoming traffic to your Site. Load balancing is a method of distributing incoming traffic requests across multiple servers, providing redundancy in case one or more servers are offline. This reduces the potential downtime risk for your Site. We recommend using CloudCannon DNS, particularly for Sites on your base domain, or investigating if your third-party DNS service provides load balancing.
* If you are using an [auto-generated SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/add-an-auto-generated-ssl-certificate/), some additional configuration is required. For more information, please read our documentation on [adding TXT DNS records](/documentation/articles/add-an-auto-generated-ssl-certificate/#add-txt-dns-records).
* If you use Cloudflare as your DNS provider and have the Cloudflare Proxy feature enabled, some additional configuration is required. For more information, please read our documentation on [configuring Cloudflare Proxy](/documentation/articles/configure-external-dns/#configure-cloudflare-proxy).

For more information, please read our documentation on [configuring external DNS](/documentation/articles/configure-external-dns/).
