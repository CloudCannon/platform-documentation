When you [connect a Custom Domain to your Organization](/documentation/articles/connect-a-custom-domain-to-your-organization/), CloudCannon requires you to select a DNS provider. DNS providers manage and host the DNS records for your Custom Domain. For more information on DNS records, please read our documentation on [DNS](/documentation/articles/what-is-dns/) in general.

When connecting a Custom Domain, you must select either CloudCannon or external DNS.

* **CloudCannon DNS** — Manage your DNS records through CloudCannon (recommended).
* **External DNS** — Manage your DNS records through a trusted third-party service (e.g., Cloudflare).

## CloudCannon DNS

CloudCannon DNS may be right for you if:

* You want to use an [auto-generated SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/add-an-auto-generated-ssl-certificate/).
* You want to manage all your domain settings in the same place you edit your content.

For more information, please read our documentation on [configuring CloudCannon DNS](/documentation/articles/configure-cloudcannon-dns/).

## External DNS

An external DNS provider may be right for you if:

* You have existing DNS infrastructure with a trusted third-party provider.
* You want to use a [custom SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/add-a-custom-ssl-certificate/).

If you select an external DNS provider for your Site hosted on CloudCannon, there are a few limitations you should consider.

* If you are using an [auto-generated SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/add-an-auto-generated-ssl-certificate/), some additional configuration is required. For more information, please read our documentation on [adding TXT DNS records](/documentation/articles/add-an-auto-generated-ssl-certificate/#add-txt-dns-records).
* If you use Cloudflare as your DNS provider and have the Cloudflare Proxy feature enabled, some additional configuration is required. For more information, please read our documentation on [configuring Cloudflare Proxy](/documentation/articles/configure-external-dns/#configure-cloudflare-proxy).

For more information, please read our documentation on [configuring external DNS](/documentation/articles/configure-external-dns/).
