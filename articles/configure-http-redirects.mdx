Once you have your [SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/) is enabled, users can visit your Site on the more secure [HTTPS](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/#http-vs-https) URL. We highly recommend redirecting all your HTTP URLs to the more secure HTTPS URLs.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  You must have configured an SSL certificate before following these instructions.  For more information, please read our documentation on [adding an auto-generated SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/add-an-auto-generated-ssl-certificate/) or [adding a custom SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/add-a-custom-ssl-certificate/).
</comp.Notice>

To redirect visitors to HTTPS:

1. Navigate to the *Routing* page under *Site Settings*.
2. Ensure the *Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS* checkbox is ticked.
3. Click the *Update Routing Details* button.

CloudCannon will now reroute all visitors using the HTTP URL address to the correct HTTPS URL address.
