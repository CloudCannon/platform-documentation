Sharing in CloudCannon enables you to invite people to edit and review your content, maintain your Sites, and manage your Organization.

There are multiple ways to share your content. Specify which content your team is allowed to edit. Select which team members can perform privileged actions, such as managing your billing or approving changes to your live website. Hide actions and files from the CloudCannon interface to create a more intuitive experience for non-technical team members. You can choose which way is right for you.

CloudCannon takes a Git-based approach to content management, so every change to your content is recorded. Each CloudCannon account has a personal history of every update they have contributed to. This way, you will always know what is happening with your content.

In the Sharing section of our documentation, we cover:

* [Managing your team members](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-team-member/) — learn what a team member is and how to add or remove them from your Organization.
* [Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-permission-groups/) — learn what a Permission Group is and what permissions are included in CloudCannon’s [default permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/).
* [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/) — create your own Permission Groups and specify which resources Group members can access.
* [Site Sharing](/documentation/articles/share-a-site-with-site-sharing/) — learn how to give a team member permission to access a specific Site in your Organization.
* [Client Sharing](/documentation/articles/share-a-site-with-client-sharing/) — create a site-specific password to share your content with people outside of CloudCannon.
* [SSO/SAML](/documentation/articles/what-is-sso-saml/) — set up Single Sign-On for greater security.

Let’s briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## Organization team members

&nbsp;

* [What is a team member?](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-team-member/)

## Permission Groups

In CloudCannon, permissions determine what actions a team member is allowed to perform in your Organization. The Permission Groups a team member belongs to will determine what permissions they have.

CloudCannon offers several default permission groups, allowing Organization Owners to decide the appropriate level of access for each team member. For Team and Enterprise plan customers, CloudCannon also offers the capacity to create custom Permission Groups, so Owners can decide exactly what resources each member is allowed to interact with and how.

For a more in-depth explanation of Permission Groups, including how to manage your Groups and those of your team members, what permissions are included in the default Permission Groups, and how to create custom Permission Groups, please read our documentation:

* [What are custom Permission Groups?](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/)
