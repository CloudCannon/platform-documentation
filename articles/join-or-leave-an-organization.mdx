An [Organization](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-organization/) is a group of people who share the same resources in CloudCannon. Anyone with a CloudCannon account can [create an Organization](/documentation/articles/creating-a-new-organization/) (these people are called [Owners](/documentation/articles/default-permission-groups/#owners)) and invite others to be [team members](/documentation/articles/manage-your-team-members/). You can be a member of multiple Organizations at once and leave them at any time.

## Join an Organization

To join an Organization in CloudCannon, [an existing member must invite you](/documentation/articles/manage-your-team-members/). When someone invites you, CloudCannon will send you an email invitation with the name of the Organization.
