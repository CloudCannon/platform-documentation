## Join an Organization

To join an [Organization](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-organization/) in CloudCannon, [an existing member must invite you](/documentation/articles/add-a-team-member-to-your-organization/). When someone invites you, CloudCannon will send you an email invitation with the name of the Organization.
