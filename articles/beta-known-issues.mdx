## Known issues

We are aware of some issues affecting the CloudCannon Beta environment. This list will be updated as these issues are addressed.

### Rich text editor

* In some cases, the *Context menu* for a table will open in the wrong place.
* In some cases, using the keyboard to navigate a table has unexpected behavior.
* Switching between an ordered and unordered list removes list styling instead of changing the list style.
* Pressing the backspace key to remove a list item indents the list item.
* Dragging a snippet will break that snippet.

### File operations

* In some cases, deleting a file while it is open in an editing interface will switch that file to a read-only state but will not apply the “This file has been deleted” banner.
* In some cases, users cannot delete a file while it is open.
* The *Review changes* modal rerenders every time a new file has unsaved changes, causing input fields in the modal to lose focus and deselecting files.

### Editing interfaces

* Editable regions from includes and layouts are not supported when working with multiple contributors.
* The *Activity dashboard* does not support multiple contributors.
* In the Visual Editor, images that use class=”editable” have unexpected behavior.

### Other

* This Beta release is not supported on mobile devices.
* In some cases, users cannot make changes to their files as the editing session is closed. Users may see the “Your version of this file was out of date. Syncing file contents...” notification.
  * Workaround: Please refresh your internet browser.
* If another user switches your site into the Beta while you are editing, you will not be notified and may encounter errors.
  * Workaround: Please refresh your internet browser.

## Fixed issues

We have addressed these issues in the CloudCannon Beta environment.

* Pressing the TAB key does not indent a list item.
* In some cases, the *Review changes* modal would list an unknown user “Someone” for deleted files.
* Users can create a file and folder with the same name, causing unexpected behavior with syncs, builds, and the CloudCannon app.
* In some cases, the *Editing*/*Viewing* dropdown does not line up correctly.
* Users can add a cursor to the *Editing*/*Viewing* dropdown and manipulate the text.
* In some cases, clicking the breadcrumb navigation in the collection browser opens a non-file in the Source Editor.
* In the Content Editor, the image Snippet does not automatically switch between inline and block when editing the surrounding text.
* Interacting the content of a Snippet without editing other file contents does not trigger an Editing state, and changes are lost.
* Pasting an image will embed a data URL instead of uploading the image.
* Users cannot drag and drop images into the rich text editor.
* There is no messaging in-app regarding sync blocking.
* In some cases, opening a file in the Source Editor erases the contents of the file.
* Users cannot restore a deleted folder as the *Context menu* is disabled.
* In some cases, typing inside a table will create an extra cell per character of text.
* In some cases, users cannot make changes to their file after switching who is editing that file.
