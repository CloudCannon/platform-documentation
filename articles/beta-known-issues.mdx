## Known Issues

We are aware of some issues affecting the CloudCannon Beta environment. This list will be updated as these issues are addressed.

Last updated: December 15th NZT

### Rich text editor

* Pressing the TAB key does not indent a list item.
* In some cases, the *Context menu* for a table will open in the wrong place.
* Using the TAB key to navigate a table causes the cursor to leave the table.
* In some cases, typing inside a table will create an extra cell per character of text.
* Users cannot drag and drop images into the rich text editor.
* Pasting an image will embed a data URL instead of uploading the image.
  * Workaround: Please upload images and then add them to the file rather than pasting the image into the file.

### File operations

* Users cannot restore a deleted folder as the *Context menu* is disabled.
  * Workaround: Please restore each file within the folder or remove the site from the Beta environment (this action will destroy all unsaved changes).
* In some cases, deleting a file while it is open in an editing interface will switch that file to a read-only state but will not apply the “This file has been deleted” banner.
* In some cases, the *Review changes* modal would list an unknown user “Someone” for deleted files.
* The *Review changes* modal rerenders every time a new file has unsaved changes, causing input fields in the modal to lose focus.
  * Workaround: Please only edit input fields in the *Review changes* modal after there are no more files to change.
* Users can create a file and folder with the same name, causing unexpected behavior with syncs, builds, and the CloudCanon app.
  * Workaround: Please do not create files and folders with the same name. Otherwise, please delete both the file and the folder.

### Editing interfaces

* In some cases, opening a file in the Source Editor erases the contents of the file.
  * Workaround: Please discard this change.
* In some cases, the *Editing*/*Viewing* dropdown does not line up correctly.
* Users can add a cursor to the *Editing*/*Viewing* dropdown and manipulate the text.
* In some cases, users cannot make changes to their file after switching who is editing that file.
* Editable regions from includes and layouts are not supported when working with multiple contributors.
* The *Activity dashboard* does not support multiple contributors.
* In the Content Editor, the image Snippet does not automatically switch between inline and block when editing the surrounding text.
  * Workaround: Please click on the image Snippet to switch between inline and block.
* In the Visual Editor, images that use class=”editable” have unexpected behavior.

### Other

* This Beta release is not supported on mobile devices.
* There is no messaging in-app regarding sync blocking. Please see Better messaging for sync blocking.
* In some cases, clicking the breadcrumb navigation in the collection browser opens a non-file in the Source Editor.
  * Workaround: Please do not create files and folders with the same name.
* In some cases, users cannot make changes to their files as the editing session is closed. Users may see the “Your version of this file was out of date. Syncing file contents...” notification.
  * Workaround: Please refresh your internet browser.
