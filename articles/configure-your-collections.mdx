<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  As of October 2024, this documentation is only applicable to Sites using Unified Configuration.
  For Sites that have not migrated to Unified Configuration, please read the documentation on our [non-unified documentation website](https://non-unified.cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/define-your-collections/).
</comp.Notice>

After syncing your Site files, configuring your Collections is one of the first steps in creating your CloudCannon configuration file. During your initial Site setup, CloudCannon only requires minimal Collection configuration: a name and path for each Collection.

You can configure your Collections at any time to customize the experience for your team members.

To configure your Collections:

1. Navigate to the *Editing* page, under *Site Settings*, and click the *Edit your configuration file* button to open your [CloudCannon configuration file](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-cloudcannon-configuration-file/) in the Data Editor.
2. Identify the *Collections* array under the *Collections and paths* section.
3. Click on an existing Collection in the array or click the *\+ Add Collection* button to add a new Collection.
4. Edit your Collection configuration. The CloudCannon configuration file is organized into four sections for each Collection: *Collection setup*, *Collection display*, *Collection editing interfaces*, and *Creating and updating pages*. You can click on any section to open editing interfaces for each Collection configuration key.
5. Once you are happy with your configuration, [save your changes](/documentation/articles/save-your-changes/) by clicking the *Save* button.

CloudCannon will commit your Collection configuration to your Git repository.

If you would prefer to, you can configure your Collections in the [Source Editor](/documentation/articles/the-source-editor/) or your local development environment. The following code is an example of the minimum configuration required for two Collections in CloudCannon.

<comp.Annotation number="1">
  Configure all your Collections under the `collections_config` key in your CloudCannon configuration file.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="2">
  Each Collection must have a unique key name.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="3">
  The `collections.[*].path` key tells CloudCannon where to find the files for your Collection. The value for this key is relative to your Site [source folder](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-cloudcannon-configuration-file/#the-source-folder).
