The new CloudCannon forms offer improved compatibility with new SSGs, reduced build times, and increased security. This guide will provide you with all the resources you need to safely migrate your existing legacy forms to the new CloudCannon forms.

If you were using legacy forms on a site, CloudCannon will have automatically created and attached a new forms Inbox to that site. That Inbox will have a single *Legacy* target, so your forms will continue working normally until you're ready to migrate.

### Migrating email forms
To migrate a legacy email form, you can follow this guide for forwarding from an Inbox to email. Your target value will be the email address in your `_to` input. The new email target only supports a single address, so if you have multiple addresses in your `_to` input or you're using the `_cc` input you'll have to create a target for each of those addresses individually.

### Migrating hooks forms
To migrate a legacy webhook form, you can follow the guide for integrating CloudCannon forms with your specific service:

* [Automate.io](/documentation/articles/integrating-your-forms-with-automate-io/)
* [IFTTT](/documentation/articles/integrating-your-forms-with-ifttt/)
* [Integromat](/documentation/articles/integrating-your-forms-with-integromat/)
* [Zapier](/documentation/articles/integrating-your-forms-with-zapier/)

Your target value will be the webhook URL in your `_hook` input.

### Removing your legacy target
Once you have set up your new targets, you're now ready to remove your *Legacy* target from your Inbox.

To remove your *Legacy* target:

1. Remove all `_to`, `_cc`, and `_hook` inputs from your legacy forms. It's important to do this first so that you don't leak any private information after you delete your *Legacy* target and the form is no longer encrypted.
2. Navigate to the forms menu in your Organization settings, under *Hosting &gt; Forms.*
3. Click the *Manage* button on the Inbox connected to your site.
4. Open the context menu for the *Legacy* target with the three dots button, and click *Delete.*

With the *Legacy* target removed, CloudCannon will skip the encrypting forms on your site for all future builds. Your form's previously encrypted details will persist until your site next builds.
