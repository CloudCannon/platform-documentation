[hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) embeds a CAPTCHA in your page to help prevent spam. [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) requires additional configuration in your Site and Inbox Settings.

### Adding [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) to an inbox

1. In your organisation settings, under *Hosting &gt; Forms* either create a new inbox or select *manage* on an existing inbox
2. Select [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) as your captcha provider.
3. Sign up at [https://www.hcaptcha.com/](https://www.hcaptcha.com/)
4. Enter your secret as your captcha secret key, and your site key as your captcha site key.

### Adding [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) to your site

1. Connect your site to your hCaptcha enabled inbox in your site settings, under *Hosting &gt; Forms.*
2. Ensure that you have selected *Require Captcha *in your site inbox settings.
3. Add a form to your site and connect it to your inbox by following the install instructions in your site inbox settings.
4. Add hCaptcha to that form by following the instructions in the [hCaptcha documentation](https://docs.hcaptcha.com/#add-the-hcaptcha-widget-to-your-webpage)

Once configured, any form submissions that fails to validate will return a 401 error page.
