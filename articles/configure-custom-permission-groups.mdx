## What are custom permission groups?

x

### Default permission groups

CloudCannon provides [default permission groups](/documentation/articles/default-permission-groups) on every pricing plan. The default permission groups (Owner, Developer, Technical Editor, and Editor) are hierarchical, meaning that each group also contains the permissions of all groups below it in the hierarchy. Default permission groups are convenient if you have fewer team members, less complex sharing requirements, or do not want to configure custom permission groups.

The default permission groups may not be right for you if:

* You want non-hierarchical permission groups.
* You want to define a subset of your sites that team members can access (e.g., a project, all sites except the production site, or a specific site).
* You want to define who can perform specific actions (e.g., making vs approving pull requests, reading vs editing content, branching, inbox management).
* You want to define which files within a site a team member can edit (e.g., a collection, specific file types, or a single file).
* You want to limit which other Organization members a team member can see (e.g., only members they share a permission group with).
* You want to prevent a team member from accessing existing sites but allow them to create new sites in your Organization, which they can edit.

Because default permission groups have a Global scope, CloudCannon will give group members the same permissions for every site in your Organization. Additionally, you cannot edit the permissions granted by default permission groups.

You can overcome these limitations by creating custom permission groups.

### Custom permission groups vs. Site Sharing

Using default permission groups, you cannot limit access to an individual site. You can address this problem using [Site Sharing](/documentation/articles/sharing-on-a-per-site-basis/) or using custom permission groups.

Site Sharing allows you to invite a CloudCannon user (called a Collaborator) from outside your Organization to view, edit, and publish content for a specific site. Each site has two permission groups for Collaborators, identical to the Technical Editor and Editor default permission groups except with a Site scope.

Custom permission groups do everything Site Sharing does and more. For Team and Enterprise customers, we recommend using custom permission groups rather than Site Sharing.

* Collaborators have permission to edit and publish content. Depending on your publishing workflow, a person from outside your Organization can publish content to your public website, which may not be desirable.
* Site Sharing Collaborators contribute towards the number of users in your Organization, so it is just as economical to invite them to your Organization as a team member and add them to a custom permission group.
