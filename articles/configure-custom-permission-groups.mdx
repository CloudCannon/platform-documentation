## What are custom permission groups?

### Default permission groups

CloudCannon provides [default permission groups](/documentation/articles/default-permission-groups) on every pricing plan. The default permission groups (Owner, Developer, Technical Editor, and Editor) are hierarchical, meaning that each group also contains the permissions of all groups below it in the hierarchy. Default permission groups are convenient if you have fewer team members, less complex sharing requirements, or do not want to configure custom permission groups.

The default permission groups may not be right for you if:

* You want non-hierarchical permission groups.
* You want to give team members access to a subset of your sites (e.g., a project, all sites except the production site).
* You want to limit who can perform specific actions (e.g., making vs. approving pull requests, reading vs. editing content, branching, inbox management).
* You want to limit which files within a site a team member can edit (e.g., a collection, a single file).
* You want to limit which other Organization members a team member can see (i.e., only members they share a permission group with).
* You want to prevent a team member from accessing existing sites but allow them to create new sites in your Organization, which they can edit.

Because default permission groups have a Global scope, CloudCannon will give group members the same permissions for every site in your Organization. Additionally, you cannot edit the permissions granted by default permission groups.

You can overcome these limitations by creating custom permission groups.
