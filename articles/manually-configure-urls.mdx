By default, CloudCannon automatically detect the output URLs for your files and assigns them at [build](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-site-build/) time. This is useful as you do not need to manually assign output URLs to each of your files.

However, this behavior may not be right for your Site if it has a larger number of files or custom Site configuration. For these Sites, CloudCannon's URLs assigning behavior may slow down your build time. For these Sites, you can disable automatic output URLs in CloudCannon and manually configure your output URLs.

To manually configure your URLs:

1. Navigate to the *editing* page under *Site Settings*.
2. Click on the *Edit your configuration file* button to open your CloudCannon configuration file.
3. &nbsp;
4. When you are happy with your manually configured URLs, navigate to the *Build Configuration* page under *Site Settings*.
5. Check the *Manually Configure URLs* flag under *Build system options*.
6. Click the *Update Configuration and Build* button.

CloudCannon will immediately build your Site using the manually configured URLs.
