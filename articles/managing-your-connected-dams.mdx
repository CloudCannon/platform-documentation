Learn how to update the details of your connected DAMs

### Updating your DAM details

To update the details that are stored in CloudCannon:

1. In your Organization settings, navigate to *Files* / *Assets*
2. Locate the relevant DAM, and click the **Manage** button next to its name
3. In the **Configuration tab**, edit your details, then click **Update** to save your changes.

### Limiting size of uploads to your DAM

You can use the **Maximum size for uploaded files** setting to prevent uploads exceeding a pre-determined size. This should be set in bytes. For example, to limit uploads to 1 GB you could set this to 1,000,000,000.
