Rather than have a single [CloudCannon Configuration File](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-cloudcannon-configuration-file/), you can split your configuration across multiple files. With a split *Configuration File*, you can organize your configuration more effectively, especially for larger sites or when working with shared configurations.

You can split the following configuration into dedicated *Configuration Files*:

* Collections (`_collection_config`)
* Schemas (`collections_config.*.schemas`)
* Inputs (`_inputs`
* Structures (`_structures`)
* Structure values
* Snippets
* Rich Text (`_editables`)

## Why split your *Configuration File*?

There are several reasons why splitting your CloudCannon configuration across multiple files might be right for your *Site*.

Splitting your configuration across multiple files allows you to keep related configurations in dedicated files (e.g., Input configuration in one file and Schema configuration in another). When updating your *Site,* you can navigate directly to the file you need, without going through a single long *Configuration File*.

Collaborating with your team is easier with split *Configuration Files*, as you can work on different parts of your *Site* configuration simultaneously.

Split *Configuration Files* also allow you to reduce configuration redundancy. For example, rather than defining a common Input under several *Collections*, you can reference a single Inputs *Configuration File* from each *Collection*.

## How

You will still have one main *Configuration File* (i.e., `cloudcannon.config.yml`) that uses `*_from_glob` keys to point at other *Configuration Files* on your *Site*.

For more information, please read our documentation on [best practices for split configuration](/documentation/articles/best-practice-for-split-configuration-files/) and [splitting your Configuration File](/documentation/articles/splitting-your-configuration-file/).

### Merge Behavior Explained

Understanding how globbed files merge with your main configuration is important:

### Object Keys (e.g., `_inputs`, `collections_config`)

* **Clobbering**: If a key exists in both the main config and a globbed file, the globbed file's value **overwrites** the main config's value
* **Order matters**: If multiple globbed files define the same key, later files (in glob order) overwrite earlier ones
* **Merging**: Keys that don't conflict are merged together

### Array Values (e.g., `_structures.*.values`)

* **Appending**: Array items from globbed files are **appended** to the array
* **No overwriting**: Array items are not keyed, so they don't overwrite each other
* **Order**: Items appear in the order they're loaded from the globbed files
