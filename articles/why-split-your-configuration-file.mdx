Rather than have a single [CloudCannon Configuration File](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-cloudcannon-configuration-file/), you can split your configuration across multiple files. With a split *Configuration File*, you can organize your configuration more effectively, especially for larger sites or when working with shared configurations.

You can split the following configuration into dedicated *Configuration Files*:

* [Collections](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-collection/) (`_collection_config`)
* [Schemas](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-schema/) (`collections_config.*.schemas`)
* [Inputs](/documentation/articles/what-are-inputs/) (`_inputs`
* [Structures](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-structure/) and Structure values (`_structures`, `_structures.*.values.value`)
* [Snippets](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-snippet/) (`_snippets`, `_snippets_imports`)
* [Rich Text](/documentation/articles/what-are-rich-text-editors/) (`_editables`)

There are several reasons why splitting your CloudCannon configuration across multiple files might be right for your *Site*:

* Splitting your configuration across multiple files allows you to keep related configurations in dedicated files (e.g., Input configuration in one file and Schema configuration in another). When updating your *Site,* you can navigate directly to the file you need, without going through a single long *Configuration File*.
* Collaborating with your team is easier with split *Configuration Files*, as you can work on different parts of your *Site* configuration simultaneously.
* You can use [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/) to only allow your team members to edit specific *Site* configuration.
* Split *Configuration Files* also allow you to reduce configuration redundancy. For example, rather than defining a common Input under several *Collections*, you can reference a single *Inputs* *Configuration File* from each *Collection*.

For more information, please read our documentation on [best practices for splitting your configuration](/documentation/articles/best-practice-for-splitting-your-configuration-file/), [defining the same key in multiple Configuration Files](/documentation/articles/defining-the-same-key-in-multiple-configuration-files/), and [split your Configuration File](/documentation/articles/split-your-configuration-file/), and our [Configuration File](/documentation/articles/configuration-file-reference/) reference documentation.

## How does splitting your *Configuration File* work?

When you split your *Site* configuration across multiple *Configuration Files*, CloudCannon still requires one main *Configuration File* (i.e., `cloudcannon.config.yml`). Your main *Configuration File* will point to other *Configuration Files* on your *Site* using `*_from_glob` keys.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````

collections_config_from_glob:
  - '/.cloudcannon/collections/*.cloudcannon.collections.yml'

``````````
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

Each *Configuration File* can reference any other *Configuration File* (as long as they all ultimately connect back to your main *Configuration File*), allowing you to organize your content to the level you require.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="/.cloudcannon/collections/posts.cloudcannon.collections.yml">
``````````

path: content/posts
icon: event
schemas_from_glob:
  - '/.cloudcannon/schemas/*.cloudcannon.schemas.yml'
  - '!/.cloudcannon/schemas/pages.cloudcannon.schemas.yml'
_inputs_from_glob:
  - '/.cloudcannon/inputs/seo.cloudcannon.inputs.yml'
  - '/.cloudcannon/inputs/blog-details.cloudcannon.inputs.yml'
_inputs:
  authors:
    type: multiselect
    options:
      values: collections.authors

``````````
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

Whenever you load your *Site* or update a *Configuration File*, CloudCannon will merge your configuration and apply it to your *Site*.

## Limitations

There are a few reasons that split *Configuration Files* may not be right for your *Site.*

1. Currently, you can only split your *Configuration File* for *Sites* using [Unified Configuration](/documentation/guides/unified-configuration-migration-guide/).
2. You cannot use `*_from_glob` keys in the front matter of content files.
3. While you can split out several sections of your *Configuration File*, the equivalent `*_from_glob` key for `_select_data` is intentionally not supported. Please use `data_config` instead.

If you have any questions about configuring your *Site* on CloudCannon, don't hesitate to contact our friendly [support team](/support/).
