After creating an Organization, your account is set up as the owner. There are 4 types of users in an Organization:

1. **Owners**: These users have full permission as if it is their own account
2. **Developers**: Can create sites and manage everything to do with them, can’t update billing information
3. **Technical Editors**: Can update sites with the source editor but cannot create new sites
4. **Editors**: Can update content on sites using the visual editing interfaces

Once your team members have access, users at all permission levels can [create new branches](/documentation/articles/create-a-project/) and edit content on your site. CloudCannon will notify Developers and Owners by email if a user makes a change that causes their build to fail.

### Adding a new Team Member

To add a team member:

1. Go to *Organization Settings* / *Team*
2. Click the **Add Member** button.

Add the email of the person you want to share, select the Permission Level required, and press **Add team member**

This will email the team member and prompts them to sign up or log in. Once logged in, they have access to all sites created under the organization at the level specified.
