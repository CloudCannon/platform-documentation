A rich text editor is an interface for editing content on your Site, with tools to format and style your content. Rich text editors use a WYSIWYG editing area, meaning that the way you format the content in the editor will resemble the way it will look on your web page (WYSIWYG is an acronym for What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get).

CloudCannon has three kinds of rich text editors:

* [The Content Editor](/documentation/articles/the-content-editor/)
* [Editable Regions](/documentation/articles/define-editable-regions-in-your-html/) in the [Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/the-visual-editor/)
* [Rich Text Inputs](/documentation/articles/rich-text-inputs/)

For each rich text editor, you can configure the WYSIWYG toolbar (including which text and image formatting tools are available for each editor), the upload paths or filenames for any assets uploaded through an editor, and how CloudCannon should handle custom markup.

For more information, please read our documentation on [configuring your rich text editors](/documentation/articles/configure-your-rich-text-editors/).

## The WYSIWYG toolbar

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/editing/editing-interfaces/2024-04/CloudCannon-Documentation-Rich-Text-WYSIWYG-Toolbar.png" alt="A closeup of the WYSIWYG toolbar, including tools for formatting rich text." title="The rich text editor WYSIWYG toolbar" type="ui-snippet"/>

The *WYSIWYG toolbar* is found at the top of all rich text editors in CloudCannon. This toolbar is populated with tools to help you format your content. This might include adding images, links, and lists, changing the alignment of your text, or simple tools such as bolding, italicizing, or underlining text. The number of tools available in your *WSYIWYG toolbar* will depend on [how your rich text editor is configured](/documentation/articles/configure-your-rich-text-editors/).

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  As soon as you define one key for the WYSIWYG toolbar, CloudCannon will interpret any omitted keys as false and disable those options.
