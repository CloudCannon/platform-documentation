## Host your Site on a subdomain

If you want your main domain to be a subdomain, you need to redirect your base domain name to the subdomain.

To set a subdomain as your main domain:

1. Create two Sites, one with your main domain and one with a subdomain.
2. Navigate to the *Domain browser* from your *Org Navigation* or *Organization Dashboard*.
3. Click the Card for the domain you want to configure.
4. Open the *Domain Settings* tab and navigate to the *Redirects* section.
5. Click the *Set Main Domain* button on the Site you want CloudCannon to treat as your main domain.

CloudCannon will redirect all unused subdomains (including the base domain) to your main domain.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  If you have configured your [DNS](/documentation/articles/what-is-dns/) to point a specific domain at a service outside of CloudCannon, CloudCannon will not be able to redirect that domain to your main domain.
