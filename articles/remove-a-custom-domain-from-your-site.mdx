<comp.Notice info_type="permissions">
  **Permissions required**

  Members of the Developers and Owners [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/), or [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/) with the `site:settings:hosting:write` permission, can remove Custom Domains from a Site.
</comp.Notice>

A Custom Domain is a unique address used to identify a website (e.g., [cloudcannon.com](https://cloudcannon.com/)). You can connect a Custom Domain to your CloudCannon Organiation and add it to a Site to host your website content on that domain.

You may want to remove a Custom Domain from a CloudCannon Site to change the domain hosting your content, move a Custom Domain to a different CloudCannon Site, or to [disconnect a Custom Domain from your Organization](/documentation/articles/disconnect-a-custom-domain-from-your-organization/).

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Removing a Custom Domain from your Site will stop all visitors from seeing your website and its content. Your website will go down until you add another a Custom Domain.
</comp.Notice>

These instructions assume you have [connected a Custom Domain to your Organization](/documentation/articles/connect-a-custom-domain-to-your-organization/) and [added a Custom Domain to your Site](/documentation/articles/add-a-custom-domain/).

To remove a Custom Domain from your Site:

1. Click the *Sites* button in the *App Sidebar*. CloudCannon will open the *Sites browser*.
2. Identify the Site from which you want to remove a Custom Domain and click on the *Site* card. CloudCannon will open the *Dashboard* for that Site.
3. Navigate to the *Custom Domain* page under *Site Settings*.
4. Click the *Remove Custom Domain* button, and confirm your action in the *Click to confirm* modal.

CloudCannon will immediately stop hosting your website content on the Custom Domain.
