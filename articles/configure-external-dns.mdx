External DNS allows you to host your Site on CloudCannon but manage your [DNS records](/documentation/articles/what-is-dns/#what-are-dns-records) elsewhere. This can be through a different provider (e.g., Cloudflare) or using your own servers.

Before you can configure DNS for your Site, you must [add a Custom Domain](/documentation/articles/add-a-custom-domain/).

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  If you are using Cloudflare as your DNS provider, you will need to configure your DNS records differently. For more information, please read the section on [configuring Cloudflare proxy](/documentation/articles/configure-external-dns/#configure-cloudflare-proxy).
</comp.Notice>

## Enable external DNS

By default, CloudCannon will enable CloudCannon DNS for your Site.

To switch to External DNS for a Site hosted on CloudCannon, edit the settings on the *Domain Settings* page.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Updating your DNS provider can cause downtime for anything connected to your domain, such as your website or custom email address. Please make sure you have a copy of your existing DNS records before you change providers.

  If you need help updating your DNS, please contact our friendly [support team](/support/).
</comp.Notice>

To switch to External DNS:

1. Navigate to the *Domain browser* by clicking the globe icon in your *App Navigation*.
2. Select the domain for which you want to configure DNS.
3. Under the *Domain Settings* tab, open the *DNS* section.
4. Select the *External DNS* option in the *DNS Provider* dropdown.
5. Click the *Update DNS Provider* button.

You can now manage your DNS records through an external provider.

### Load balancing on external DNS

x

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  [CloudCannon DNS](/documentation/articles/configure-cloudcannon-dns/) is strongly recommended for sites on apex domains (no subdomain).\* External DNS\* relies on an A record mapped to a single server. This cannot be dynamically load balanced, reducing redundancy and increasing potential down time risk.
</comp.Notice>

### CloudCannon DNS records

When you enable external DNS for a Site hosted on CloudCannon, CloudCannon will ask you to add three DNS records to your DNS provider: two A Records and a CNAME Record.

The two A Records specify the IP addresses for the

The CNAME Record

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  The CNAME record maps your subdomains to CloudCannon servers. The A record maps your apex domain to a specific CloudCannon server.
</comp.Notice>

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  If you use a Cloudflare, setting up a CNAME Record for your base domain while using external DNS will result in a 1001 DNS Error.
</comp.Notice>

## Configure Cloudflare Proxy

CloudCannon hosting uses Cloudflare. If you are using Cloudflare as your DNS provider and have Cloudflare's Orange Cloud feature enabled for your DNS records, you will not be able to proxy directly to the normal CloudCannon CNAME (i.e., site.cloudcannon.com).

To resolve this issue, you can either turn off Orange Cloud, or set up Cloudflare Proxy with CloudCannon Origin and add a CNAME record to your DNS provider.

To set up Cloudflare Proxy with CloudCannon Origin:

1. Navigate to the *Custom Domain* page, under *Site Settings*.
2. Under the *Setup* tab, select the *Cloudflare Proxy with CloudCannon Origin* option in the *Hosting Setup* dropdown.
3. Click the *Switch to Cloudflare Proxy with CloudCannon Origin* to confirm.

To add a CNAME record:

1. Log in to your third party DNS provider.
2. Add a CNAME record pointing your Domain Name (e.g., example.com) at *orange-cloud.cloudcannon.com*.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Your Site might be cached externally if you use Cloudflare Proxy. In this case, your Site won't show any updates until you manually clear your cache.
</comp.Notice>

## Single Origin

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  We do not recommend this option unless you have specific set up requirements. For assistance setting up your DNS, please contact our friendly [support team](/support/).
</comp.Notice>

In some cases, you may need to configure your DNS records to point directly at CloudCannon's host origin, rather than *sites.cloudcannon.com*. This bypasses the normal benefits of hosting on CloudCannon:

his is not recommended, but fits a select *set* of use cases, the most common of which is pointing the apex of a domain at CloudCannon while also needing to use an external DNS. Only use this if you have a specific reason to do so.

To resolve this issue, you can set up Single Origin hosting and add DNS records to your DNS provider.

To set up Single Origin hosting:

1. Navigate to the *Custom Domain* page, under *Site Settings*.
2. Under the *Setup* tab, select the *Single Origin* option in the *Hosting Setup* dropdown.
3. Click the *Switch to Single Origin* to confirm.

To add a DNS records:

1. Log in to your third party DNS provider.
2. Add the CNAME record and A records displayed on the *Setup* tab of the *Custom Domain* page.
