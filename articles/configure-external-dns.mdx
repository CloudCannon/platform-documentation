<comp.Notice info_type="permissions">
  **Permissions required**

  Members of the Owners or Developers [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/), or [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/) with the `base-domain:settings:dns` permission, can edit DNS details on a Custom Domain's dedicated Domain page.
</comp.Notice>

If you are hosting your website through CloudCannon and selected external DNS as your DNS provider, CloudCannon will ask you to update the DNS records on your DNS provider. Specifically, you need to add a CNAME record to direct queries for any subdomains to CloudCannon's hosting servers, and two A records to specify the IP addresses of the appropriate CloudCannon hosting servers for the your Custom Domain.

For more information on DNS records, please read our documentation on [DNS](/documentation/articles/what-is-dns/#what-is-a-nameserver).

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  If you are using Cloudflare as your DNS provider, you will need to configure your DNS records differently. For more information, please read the section on [configuring Cloudflare proxy](/documentation/articles/configure-external-dns/#configure-cloudflare-proxy).
</comp.Notice>

These instructions assume

To configure DNS records for an external provider:

1. Log in to CloudCannon and select the Organization with the Custom Domain you want to update.
2. Click the *Domains* button in the *App Sidebar*. CloudCannon will open the *Domains browser*.
3. Identify the domain you want to update and click on the *Domain* card. CloudCannon will open the *Domain* page for this Custom Domain.
4. On the *DNS* tab, CloudCannon will list the CNAME record and A records for your Custom Domain.
5. Log in to your DNS Provider and follow their instructions to update your DNS records to match those provided by CloudCannon.

Your DNS Provider will process your updated DNS records. This should take a few minutes, but may take up to 24 hours.

## Configure Cloudflare Proxy

CloudCannon hosting uses Cloudflare. This means if you use Cloudflare as your DNS Provider and have Cloudflare's Proxy feature enabled for your DNS records, you will not be able to proxy directly to the normal CloudCannon CNAME (i.e., sites.cloudcannon.com).

To resolve this issue, you can either turn off Orange Cloud or set up Cloudflare Proxy with CloudCannon Origin and add a CNAME record to your DNS provider.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

If you use a Cloudflare, setting up a CNAME Record for your base domain while using external DNS will result in a 1001 DNS Error.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Your Site might be cached externally if you use Cloudflare Proxy. In this case, your Site won't show any updates until you manually clear your cache.
</comp.Notice>

## Single Origin

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  We do not recommend this option unless you have specific set up requirements. For assistance setting up your DNS, please contact our friendly [support team](/support/).
</comp.Notice>

In some cases, you may need to configure your DNS records to point directly at CloudCannon's host origin rather than *sites.cloudcannon.com*. This bypasses the normal benefits of hosting on CloudCannon:

* The ability for CloudCannon to auto-generate a wildcard SSL certificate for your domain and its subdomains.
* Faster DNS lookup speed due to a globally distributed edge caching network.

Most commonly, you might use this setup if you need to point your base domain at CloudCannon while also using an external DNS.

## Configure Cloudflare Proxy

CloudCannon hosting uses Cloudflare. If you are using Cloudflare as your DNS provider and have Cloudflare's Proxy feature enabled for your DNS records, you will not be able to proxy directly to the normal CloudCannon CNAME (i.e., sites.cloudcannon.com).

&nbsp;

To set up Cloudflare Proxy with CloudCannon Origin:

1. Navigate to the *Custom Domain* page under *Site Settings*.
2. Under the *Setup* tab, select the *Cloudflare Proxy with CloudCannon Origin* option in the *Hosting Setup* dropdown.
3. Click the *Switch to Cloudflare Proxy with CloudCannon Origin* to confirm.

To add a CNAME record:

1. Log in to Cloudflare and navigate to your DNS settings.
2. Add a CNAME record pointing to your Domain Name (e.g., example.com) at *orange-cloud.cloudcannon.com*.

## Single Origin

&nbsp;

To achieve this, you can set up Single Origin hosting and add DNS records to your DNS provider.

To set up Single Origin hosting:

1. Navigate to the *Custom Domain* page under *Site Settings*.
2. Under the *Setup* tab, select the *Single Origin* option in the *Hosting Setup* dropdown.
3. Click the *Switch to Single Origin* to confirm.

To add a DNS records:

1. Log in to your third-party DNS provider.
2. Add the CNAME record displayed on the *Setup* tab of the *Custom Domain* page. If your DNS provider does not allow CNAME records on a base domain, add the two A records instead.
