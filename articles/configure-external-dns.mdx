External DNS allows you to host your Site on CloudCannon but manage your [DNS records](/documentation/articles/what-is-dns/#what-are-dns-records) elsewhere. This can be through a different provider (e.g., Cloudflare) or using your own servers.

Before you can configure DNS for your Site, you must [add a Custom Domain](/documentation/articles/add-a-custom-domain/).

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  If you are using Cloudflare as your DNS provider, you will need to configure your DNS records differently. For more information, please read the section on [configuring Cloudflare proxy](/documentation/articles/configure-external-dns/#configure-cloudflare-proxy).
</comp.Notice>

## Enable external DNS

By default, CloudCannon will enable CloudCannon DNS for your Site.

To switch to External DNS for a Site hosted on CloudCannon, edit the settings on the *Domain Settings* page.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Updating your DNS provider can cause downtime for anything connected to your domain, such as your website or custom email address. Please make sure you have a copy of your existing DNS records before you change providers.

  If you need help updating your DNS, please contact our friendly [support team](/support/).
</comp.Notice>

To switch to External DNS:

1. Navigate to the *Domain browser* by clicking the globe icon in your *App Navigation*.
2. Select the domain for which you want to configure DNS.
3. Under the *Domain Settings* tab, open the *DNS* section.
4. Select the *External DNS* option in the *DNS Provider* dropdown.
5. Click the *Update DNS Provider* button.

You can now manage your DNS records through an external provider.

### CloudCannon DNS records

When you enable external DNS for a Site hosted on CloudCannon, CloudCannon will ask you to add three DNS records to your DNS provider: two A Records and a CNAME Record.

The two A Records specify the IP addresses for the

The CNAME Record

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  If you use a Cloudflare, setting up a CNAME Record for your base domain while using external DNS will result in a 1001 DNS Error.

Use your own DNS servers.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Changes to DNS can take up to **48 hours** to propagate, depending on the previous TTL set. Test your site is configured correctly with the pingdom DNS checker.
</comp.Notice>

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  [CloudCannon DNS](/documentation/articles/configure-cloudcannon-dns/) is strongly recommended for sites on apex domains (no subdomain).\* External DNS\* relies on an A record mapped to a single server. This cannot be dynamically load balanced, reducing redundancy and increasing potential down time risk.
</comp.Notice>

If you want to host a site on CloudCannon, but manage your DNS records externally, you can use *External DNS*. To configure your domain with *External DNS*, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you are using *External DNS*. Otherwise click **External DNS** and *Switch to External DNS*.
2. Note the CNAME and A records provided by CloudCannon.
3. Go to your external DNS provider and find the DNS settings for your domain.
4. Set the CNAME and A records to match those provided by CloudCannon.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  The CNAME record maps your subdomains to CloudCannon servers. The A record maps your apex domain to a specific CloudCannon server.
</comp.Notice>

Here is the DNS documentation from a few domain registrars:

* [iwantmyname](https://help.iwantmyname.com/hc/en-gb/categories/360002768037-DNS-Nameservers)
* [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/freedns.aspx) (can be used with any domain registrar)
* [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/help/managing-dns-for-your-domain-names-680)

## Apex Domains

In some cases, you may configure your DNS to point directly at CloudCannon’s host origin, bypassing many of the normal benefits of CloudCannon hosting. This is not recommended, but fits a select *set* of use cases, the most common of which is pointing the apex of a domain at CloudCannon while also needing to use an external DNS. Only use this if you have a specific reason to do so.

Click *Single Origin* under *Site Settings* / *Domain* in your site settings. This will show you the DNS records you should use:

## Cloudflare Proxy

CloudCannon hosting uses Cloudflare. If you’re using Cloudflare DNS for your domain and have Cloudflare’s orange cloud feature on your DNS records, you will not be able to proxy directly to the normal CloudCannon CNAME.

Instead, you can either turn the orange cloud feature off or you can use a custom CNAME which connects directly to our origin. Click *Cloudflare Proxy* under *Site Settings* / *Domain* in your site settings. This will show you the CNAME value you should use.
