  **This feature is available on our [Enterprise plan](/pricing/).**

  Want to chat about whether this feature is right for you? Our support team is always <a href="mailto:success@cloudcannon.com?subject=A%20question%20about%20SSO%2FSAML" rel="noreferrer">happy to hear from you</a>.
</comp.Notice>

To set up [SSO/SAML](/documentation/articles/what-is-sso-saml/), you will need to copy data from CloudCannon to your Identity Provider and vice versa.

You must also identify which [Permission Group](/documentation/articles/what-are-permission-groups/) for new team members should be added to. This can be a [default](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/) or [Custom Permission Group](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/). CloudCannon will add new team members to this Permission Group if they join your Organization through SSO login rather than the CloudCannon email invitation link.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  SAML can be tricky to configure. If you need assistance setting-up SSO/SAML, please don’t hesitate to contact our [support team](/support/).
</comp.Notice>

## Configure your Identity Provider

To configure your Identity Provider software:

1. Navigate to the *Single Sign-On* page under *Org settings*.
2. Copy the *Login URL* and *Consume URL (SSO URL)* links from CloudCannon and enter them into your Identity Provider.
3. Your Identity Provider will provide you with the details for *SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP)*, I*ssuer Suffix* (must begin with “cloudcannon.com/”), *Name ID Format*, *Authn Context*, and *X.509 Certificate*. Copy these details or download the XML file provided.

## Configure SAML

To configure SAML:

1. Navigate to the *Single Sign-On* page under *Org settings*.
2. Select the initial Permission Group for team members joining your Organization through SSO.
3. Enter the details for *SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP)*, *Issuer Suffix* (must begin with “cloudcannon.com/”), *Name ID Format*, *Authn Context*, and *X.509 Certificate*. Alternatively, click the *Fill form using XML Metadata* button and upload your XML file.
4. Click the *Add Single Sign-On* button.

CloudCannon will provide additional details once you have set up SAML. Your identity provider may require these details.
