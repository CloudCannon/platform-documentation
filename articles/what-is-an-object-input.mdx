An Object input is an editing interface for structured data. You can use this input in the Data Editor, Content Editor, or Visual Editor to edit structured data in data files or front matter.

Object inputs can contain nested inputs of any type, including other Objects and Arrays. There is no limit to how many nested layers you can create within an Object. Grouping inputs under an Object is useful for organizing your data or hiding complicated or infrequently edited data.

Unlike other input types, the Object input has one type but three subtypes:

* Object
* Tabbed Object
* Mutable Object

## Object input subtypes

### Object

The Object input provides a user interface for a group of inputs.

Object inputs appear as [Cards](/documentation/articles/configure-your-card-previews/) in the Data Editor or sidebar of the Visual or Content Editor, previewing some of the content they contain.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Object-Input-Closed" alt="A screenshot of the Object Input in the Data Editor shows a card previewing the nested title, description, and image." title="The Object input" type="ui-snippet"/>

When you click on the Object card, it will open to show the nested inputs within that Object. The *Back* button at the top of the input will return you to the parent scope.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Object-Input-Open" alt="A screenshot of the nested content within an Object Input in the Data Editor." title="The Object input" type="ui-snippet"/>

### Tabbed Object

The Tabbed Object input provides a user interface for a group of inputs with two or more layers of nested keys. Tabbed Objects are useful if you want to display Objects with two or more layers of nested keys in a more intuitive manner.

The Object input appears as a Card in the Data Editor or sidebar of the Visual or Content Editor.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Tabbed-Object-Input-Closed" alt="A screenshot of the Tabbed Object Input in the Data Editor shows a card previewing the nested title, description, and image." title="The Object input" type="ui-snippet"/>

Clicking on the Object Card shows each first-level nested key as a tab at the top of the input, as well as all nested inputs within your first-level keys.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Tabbed-Object-Input-First-Tab" alt="A screenshot of the nested content within a Tabbed Object Input in the Data Editor." title="The Object input" type="ui-snippet"/>

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Tabbed-Object-Input-Second-Tab" alt="A screenshot of the nested content within a Tabbed Object Input in the Data Editor." title="The Object input" type="ui-snippet"/>

### Mutable Object

The Mutable Object input provides a user interface for a group of inputs. Rather than clicking on the Object input card to view the nested keys, such as in an Object or Tabbed Object input, all the nested keys in a Mutable Object are visible at the top scope of the input.

You can edit the value of a Mutable Object input by adding, deleting, cloning, renaming, and reordering nested keys. Mutable Objects function similarly to [Array inputs](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-array-input/), except they do not allow multiple nested keys with the same name.

## Object input appearance and behavior

You can customize the label, comment, documentation link, and context box for all inputs regardless of type.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Object-Input-With-Context" alt="A screenshot of the Object Input in the Data Editor with a Context Box underneath the card." title="Object Input with Context Box" type="ui-snippet"/>

Depending on how your developer configured the input, your Object input may have groups for nested inputs, including headings, comments, and links, or a custom preview appearance for Object Cards.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Object-Input-Groups" alt="A screenshot of the nested content within an Object Input in the Data Editor shows groups, heading, documentation links, and comments." title="The Object input" type="ui-snippet"/>

### Input validation

Your Object input may also have input validation, which requires the value to match predefined criteria before you can save your changes.

CloudCannon will show a red `*` next to the name of your Object input if a value is required.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Object-Input-Required" alt="A screenshot of the Object input in the Data Editor shows that no value is causing an input validation error." title="Object Input with required value" type="ui-snippet"/>

CloudCannon will warn you that errors need attention when an input nested within an Object fails input validation.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Object-Input-Invalid" alt="A screenshot of the Object input in the Data Editor shows that one or more nested inputs have a validation error." title="Object Input with required value" type="ui-snippet"/>

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Object-Input-Invalid-Children" alt="A screenshot of the invalid nested inputs within an Object input in the Data Editor." title="Object Input with required value" type="ui-snippet"/>

For more information on configuration options, valid input values, and unconfigured input behavior, please read our developer documentation on [configuring an Object input](/documentation/articles/configure-an-object-input/) .

## Misconfigured Object inputs

You will see an orange warning box if your Object input is misconfigured.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Object-Input-Misconfigured" alt="A screenshot of a misconfigured Object input in the Data Editor shows an orange warning box." title="A misconfigured Object Input" type="ui-snippet"/>

Object inputs are misconfigured if:

* The value is not a nested key(s).

For more information on how to fix a misconfigured Object input, please read our developer documentation on [configuring an Object input](/documentation/articles/configure-an-object-input/).
