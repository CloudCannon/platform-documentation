Select inputs are editing interfaces for selecting values from predefined lists. You can use these inputs in the Data Editor, Content Editor, or Visual Editor to edit structured data in data files or front matter.

There are four types of Select inputs:

* Select
* Multiselect
* Choice
* Multichoice

## Select input types

### Select

The Select input provides an editing interface for data with multiple predefined options. This input has the same function as a Choice input but a different appearance.

Select inputs only allow one value.

You can edit the value of a Select input by clicking on the text field and selecting an option from the dropdown menu. Alternatively, you can type into the text field to filter the options in the dropdown menu.

### Multiselect

The Multiselect input provides an editing interface for data with multiple predefined options. This input has the same function as a Multichoice input but a different appearance.

Multiselect inputs allow several values.

You can edit the value of a Multiselect input by clicking on the text field and selecting an option from the dropdown menu. Alternatively, you can type into the text field to filter the options in the dropdown menu.

## Select input appearance and behavior

You can customize the label, comment, documentation link, and context box for all inputs regardless of type.

Depending on how your developer configured the input, your Select inputs may allow you to create new values.

For Choice and Multichoice inputs, your developer can configure the appearance of the buttons, including text, icon, icon color, or image.

### Input validation

Your Select inputs may have input validation, which requires the input value to meet predefined criteria before you can save your changes. CloudCannon will warn you if your input value is invalid and provide directions on how to fix it.

CloudCannon will show a red `*` next to the name of your Select inputs if a value is required.

If you enter a value under the minimum or over the maximum character count in a Select or Multiselect input that allows you to create new values, CloudCannon will display an error message in red text under the input field.

If you select a number of options under the minimum or over the maximum item number in a Choice or Multichoice input, CloudCannon will display an error message in red text under the input field.

If your developer has configured a pattern for your input value, CloudCannon will warn you when the value does not match the pattern. CloudCannon will show any error messages underneath the code area in red.

For more information, please read our developer documentation on [configuring a Select input](/documentation/articles/configure-a-select-input/) for configuration options, valid input values, and unconfigured input behavior.

## Misconfigured Select inputs

You will see an orange warning box if your Select input is misconfigured.

Select inputs are misconfigured if:

* The value of a Select or Choice input is not a string.
* The value of a Multiselect or Multichoice input is not an array of strings.

For more information on how to fix a misconfigured Select input, please read our developer documentation on [configuring a Select input](/documentation/articles/configure-a-select-input/).
