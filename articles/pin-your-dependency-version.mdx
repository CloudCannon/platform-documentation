## Node.js

CloudCannon uses the LTS (<comp.SystemVersionDefault language="node" item="node"/>) version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) by default. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md) to select which node version to use with your build.

The following [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) versions are pre-installed:

<comp.SystemVersionList language="node" item="node"/>

Each [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version has the following packages preinstalled globally:

* [Rosey](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rosey)
* [Reseed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reseed)
* [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

### Usage

Select which nvm version to use in your [preinstall](/documentation/articles/extending-your-build-process-with-hooks/) script:

<comp.CodeBlock language="shell" source=".cloudcannon/preinstall">
```
nvm use v20.12.2
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Or install and use a custom version:

<comp.CodeBlock language="shell" source=".cloudcannon/preinstall">
```
nvm install v17.5.0
nvm use v17.5.0
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

### .nvmrc

Add a `.nvmrc` to your site's root directory to specify which node version to use. For example:

<comp.CodeBlock language="plaintext" source=".nvmrc">
```
v12.22.9
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Then in your preinstall script:

<comp.CodeBlock language="shell" source=".cloudcannon/preinstall">
```
nvm use
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

### Using alternative package managers

CloudCannon has npm and yarn pre-installed. Other package managers such as pnpm are not installed by default.

You can use `/.cloudcannon/preinstall` to add pnpm or another package managers to your build/install commands. For more information, please read our documentation on [build hooks](/documentation/articles/extending-your-build-process-with-hooks/#preinstall).

## Go

CloudCannon's build environment includes [Go](https://go.dev/). [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) sites can use this for [modules](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/).

Currently, [Go](https://go.dev/) versions are:

<comp.SystemVersionList language="go" item="go"/>

## Hugo

The default [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) version available in the build environment is <comp.SystemVersionDefault language="go" item="hugo"/> (extended).

CloudCannon always installs the [extended](https://gohugo.io/installation/linux/#editions) version of Hugo.

The build environment also supports the Hugo Dart Sass transpiler with [Embedded Dart Sass](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass-embedded) preinstalled. The current supported version of [Embedded Dart Sass](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass-embedded) is `1.49.9`

## Ruby

CloudCannon supports Ruby versions using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv). Jekyll sites without the version specified default to version <comp.SystemVersionDefault language="ruby" item="ruby"/>.

Versions installed are:

<comp.SystemVersionList language="ruby" item="ruby"/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If you require a Ruby version not listed above, please contact support. We will do our best to accommodate your needs.
</comp.Notice>

### Setting your version

To set your version add a `.ruby-version` file in the root folder. This file should contain one of versions specified above.

Hereâ€™s an example `.ruby-version`:

<comp.CodeBlock language="plaintext" source=".ruby-version">
```
2.6.2
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

[Install rbenv on your local environment](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation) to ensure the same version is used. It is considered best practice to set your ruby version per project. This ensures that local builds and CloudCannon builds use the same version of Ruby.
