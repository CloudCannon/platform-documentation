The Data Editor offers a simple way to manage structured data files and the front matter of combination files. This editing interface also doubles as the sidebar and data panels in the Visual and Content Editors.

The Data Editor is most useful for data files, such as YAML, TOML, JSON, CSV, and TSV files, or for editing the front matter of markup files without interacting with the main body of content.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Depending on your SSG and site configuration, you may not have access to the Data Editor for all files. An editing interface may not be available because:

  * The file you want to open does not contain structured data (e.g., Markdown or MDX files with no front matter).
  * A developer on your team has [specified which editing interfaces are enabled](/documentation/articles/set-a-default-editing-interface/) for a particular [collection](/documentation/articles/define-your-collections/) or [schema.](/documentation/articles/create-a-schema/)
</comp.Notice>

### What is front matter?

Front matter is structured data that precedes the main content in a combination file. As the name implies, a combination file contains markup content and structured data (e.g., a Markdown or MDX file with front matter).

Front matter data contains information about the file. This information can range from simple data like file title and author to SEO information to custom variables created by you or your team. Front matter is useful for providing context to your file's content.

For most SSGs, front matter is stored at the top of a file between two sets of triple-dash characters `---`, although this can vary.

## Data Editor features

The Data Editor is a simple interface for editing the values of your structured data through [inputs](/documentation/articles/configure-your-inputs/). Each input corresponds to a key in your front matter or data file, providing an editing interface for those values.

Editing your front matter or data files is easy. Update the date, title, and author fields for a blog post. Tick the checkbox to toggle whether a page is live. Upload a feature or thumbnail image. For more information about the types of inputs available in CloudCannon, read our documentation on [configuring your inputs](/documentation/articles/configure-your-inputs/).

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  By default, you cannot add or delete inputs in the Data Editor. You can configure this functionality using the [mutable key](/documentation/articles/object-inputs/#mutable-object).
</comp.Notice>

Letâ€™s go through a few of the features of the Data Editor.

For more information, including a walk-through of the *Editing interface navigation* and the *Context menu*, read our documentation on <a href="/documentation/articles/edit-your-files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">editing your files</a>.

### The sidebar in the Visual or Content Editor

You can edit the front matter and content of combination files in the same editing interface using the [Visual](/documentation/articles/the-visual-editor/) or [Content Editor](/documentation/articles/the-content-editor/). Data from the front matter of your file will appear in the editor sidebar. The sidebar is the same interface as the Data Editor, just smaller.

You can open or close the sidebar using the arrow button on the right of the panel.

### Data panels in the Visual or Content Editor

If you have [visual data bindings](/documentation/articles/what-are-visual-data-bindings/) and [previews](/documentation/articles/what-is-live-editing/) configured, you can edit page components using the data panels in the Visual Editor. You can see your changes as you edit. CloudCannon will update the page in the Visual Editor each time you alter the input values in a data panel.

You can move the data panel around the screen by clicking and dragging the panel header.
