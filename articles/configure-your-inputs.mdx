<comp.Notice info_type="permissions">
  **Permissions required**

  Members of all [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/), or [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/) with the `site:file:write` permission, can configure inputs in all locations in the configuration cascade. You can limit permission to specific locations in the configuration using [file globs](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/#specify-a-file-glob).
</comp.Notice>

An input is an editing interface for structured data in your data files or the front matter of markup files. Inputs appear in the [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/the-data-editor/), as well as in the sidebar and data panels of the [Content Editor](/documentation/articles/the-content-editor/) and [Visual Editors](/documentation/articles/the-visual-editor/). You can configure inputs anywhere in the configuration cascade, allowing you to control the scope and priority of a given configuration.

Inputs are always configured under the `_inputs` key. For a complete list of configuration keys available for inputs please read our [inputs reference](/documentation/articles/inputs-reference/) documentation.

These instructions assume that you know what type of input you want to configure and where in the configuration cascade. For more information, please read our documentation on [inputs](/documentation/articles/what-are-inputs/) in general and the [configuration cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/).

To configure an input:

1. Open your website files in your local development environment, or log in to CloudCannon and select the Site for which you want to configure your input.
2. Navigate to the location in the configuration cascade where you want to configure your input. This can be the root of your CloudCannon Configuration File, within the `collections_config.[*]` key in your CloudCannon Configuration File, a Schema file, a markup file, or any where you configure a Structure.
3. Identify the `_inputs` key, or create one at that level of the configuration cascade.
4. Add an input name key for your input under the `_inputs` key (a.k.a., `_inputs.[*]`). We recommend naming your input something simple that indicates the function or context.
5. Add the `type` key under your input name key, with an appropriate value for the type of input you want.
6. (Optional.) Add any other general configuration keys (e.g., `label`, `comment`, `context`) under your input name key.
7. (Optional.) Add any specific configuration keys under `_inputs.[*].options` (e.g., `required`).

CloudCannon will now apply this input configuration to all markup files that use your input name key, without needing to save your configuration. This allows you to make changes to your input configuration and see those changes affect inputs live.

When you are happy with your input configuration, you must save your input configuration.

If you have misconfigured your input, CloudCannon will display an orange warning notification in the Data Editor or the sidebar of the Visual or Content Editor. Please check your input type and values are correct, or contact our friendly [support team](/support/).

## Example

We want to add tags to our blog articles so visitors to our website can filter our articles by tag for better search results. Part of this project involves adding a [Multiselect input](/documentation/articles/what-are-select-and-multiselect-inputs/) in the sidebar of the Content Editor, so our content team can add tags to blog articles as they write them.

Let's create an input called `blog_tags` at the Collection level of the configuration cascade. At this level of the configuration cascade, any markup file in the "Blog" Collection that includes the `blog_tags` key in the frontmatter will use our input configuration in the Data Editor and the sidebar of the Visual or Content Editor.

We can use the following input configuration in our Blog Collection configuration:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````

collections_config:
  blog:
    _inputs___1___:
      blog_tags___2___:
        type___3___: multiselect
        label___4___: Blog type
        comment___5___: Select a blog type
        context___6___:
          open: false
          title: Help
          icon: help
          content: |
            Blog tags help our users filter articles by topic.

To ensure that all new and updated blog articles include the `blog_tags` key in the frontmatter, we can add the input key to our blog article schema: `blog.md`. For more information, please read our documentation on [Schemas](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-schema/).
