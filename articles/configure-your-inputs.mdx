<comp.Notice info_type="permissions">
  **Permissions required**

  Members of all [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/), or [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/) with the `site:file:write` permission, can configure inputs in all locations in the configuration cascade. You can limit permission to specific locations in the configuration using [file globs](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/#specify-a-file-glob).
</comp.Notice>

An input is an editing interface for structured data in your data files or the front matter of markup files. Inputs appear in the [Data Editor](https://vestal-rook.cloudvent.net/documentation/articles/the-data-editor/), as well as in the sidebar and data panels of the [Content Editor](https://vestal-rook.cloudvent.net/documentation/articles/the-content-editor/) and [Visual Editors](https://vestal-rook.cloudvent.net/documentation/articles/the-visual-editor/). You can configure inputs anywhere in the configuration cascade, allowing you to control the scope and priority of a given configuration.

Inputs are always configured under the `_inputs` key. For a complete list of configuration keys available for inputs please read our [inputs reference](/documentation/articles/inputs-reference/) documentation.

These instructions assume that you know what type of input you want to configure and where in the configuration cascade. For more information, please read our documentation on [inputs](/documentation/articles/what-are-inputs/) in general and the [configuration cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/).

To configure an input:

1. Log in to CloudCannon and select the Site for which you want to configure your input.
2. Navigate to the location in the configuration cascade where you want to configure your input. This can be the root of your CloudCannon Configuration File, within the `collections_config.(*)` key in your CloudCannon Configuration File, a Schema file, a markup file, or any where you configure a Structure.
3. &nbsp;Identify the `_inputs` key, or create one at the correct level for yourtop level of your configuration file.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

1. Add the key name of your input under `_inputs`.
2. Add the `type` key nested under your input key, with an appropriate value for the type of input you want.
3. Add any other keys you want to configure under your input key (e.g., `label`, `comment`, `context`, `options`).
4. [Save your changes](https://vestal-rook.cloudvent.net/documentation/articles/save-your-changes/) to the CloudCannon configuration file.

CloudCannon will...

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If you have misconfigured your input, CloudCannon will display an orange warning notification in the Data Editor or the sidebar of the Visual or Content Editor.

  Please check your input type and values are correct, or contact our friendly [support team](/support/).

## Example

We want to add tags to our blog articles so visitors to our website can filter our articles by tag for better search results.

Part of this project involves adding a [Multiselect input](/documentation/articles/configure-your-select-and-multiselect-inputs/) in the sidebar of the Content Editor, so our content team can add tags to blog articles as they write them. All the tags

We can use the following input configuration in the

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">

collections_config:
  blog:

We want to create a tag system for our blog articles so that users can filter our articles by tag for better search results. For this to work, we need to add a list containing relevant tags to the front matter of each blog file. When content creators write a new blog, they can select which tags apply using a [Multiselect input](/documentation/articles/configure-your-select-and-multiselect-inputs/) in the sidebar of the Content Editor.

Here’s our input configuration:

You can configure your inputs to determine the editing interface for structured data in your data files or the front matter of markup files. You can also customize the appearance and functionality of each input to improve the experience for your team members.

You can configure your [inputs](/documentation/articles/what-are-inputs/) anywhere in the [configuration cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/). In this article, we will show you how to configure an input at the global level in your [configuration file](/documentation/articles/create-a-global-configuration-file/).

To configure your inputs:

1. Navigate to your CloudCannon configuration file and open it in the [Source Editor](/documentation/articles/the-source-editor/).
2. Identify the `_inputs` key, or create one at the top level of your configuration file.
3. Add the key name of your input under `_inputs`.
4. Add the `type` key nested under your input key, with an appropriate value for the type of input you want.
5. Add any other keys you want to configure under your input key (e.g., `label`, `comment`, `context`, `options`).
6. [Save your changes](/documentation/articles/save-your-changes/) to the CloudCannon configuration file.

Once you have configured your input, you must add the input key to a data file or the front matter of a markup file. CloudCannon will display the input in the [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/the-data-editor/) or the sidebar of the [Visual](/documentation/articles/the-visual-editor/) or [Content Editor](/documentation/articles/the-content-editor/) when you open this file.

## Example

Let’s walk through an example.

We want to create a tag system for our blog articles so that users can filter our articles by tag for better search results. For this to work, we need to add a list containing relevant tags to the front matter of each blog file. When content creators write a new blog, they can select which tags apply using a [Multiselect input](/documentation/articles/configure-your-select-and-multiselect-inputs/) in the sidebar of the Content Editor.

Here’s our input configuration:

Once we add the above code to our configuration file, we need to add the input to the front matter of our blog file.

<comp.CodeBlock language="Markdown" source="blog.md">
``````````

blog_tags:

The content of the blog goes here.

``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

CloudCannon will show the `blog_tags` input in the Data Editor and the sidebar of the Visual or Content Editor.

For more information about options you can configure in your Inputs, please read our [Inputs reference](/documentation/articles/inputs-reference/) documentation.
