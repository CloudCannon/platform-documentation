A Collection is a group of related files with a similar format (e.g., a folder of pages, blog posts, or data files). Collections in CloudCannon are a core part of your CMS experience.

In CloudCannon, your collections appear in the *App Navigation* for easy access. Clicking on a Collection will open the *Collection browser*, showing you a preview of each file. This allows your team members to see all your content at a glance.

At the top of the *Collection browser* is the *File sort* dropdown, the *Card view* dropdown, and the *Collection filter* search bar. By default, Collections also have an *\+ Add* button in the top right.
