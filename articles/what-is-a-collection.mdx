A Collection is a group of related files with a similar format (e.g., a folder of pages, blog posts, or data files). Collections are a core part of your CloudCannon CMS experience.

By default, CloudCannon automatically detects your Collections when you first create your [CloudCannon configuration file](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-cloudcannon-configuration-file/) by searching your files for folders of similar content. You can [configure your Collections]() when you first create your Site, or at any time by opening your CloudCannon configuration file in the [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/the-data-editor/) or [Source Editor](/documentation/articles/the-source-editor/).

In CloudCannon, your Collections appear in the *Site Navigation* for easy access. Each Collection has a name and icon. You can also [configure Collection groups in the *Site Navigation*](/documentation/articles/configure-your-site-navigation/)to organize your content further.

Clicking on a Collection will open the *Collection browser*. The *Collection browser* shows you all the files in your Collection, with each file represented by a [Card](/documentation/articles/what-are-cards/). Depending on how you have configured your Site, these file Cards will show:

* The title of your file.
* An icon.
* Some metadata associated with that file (e.g., the output URL).
* An image within the file or a preview screenshot of the webpage to which the file outputs.

This allows your team members to see all your content at a glance.

  For more information on configuring how your files look in the *Collection browser*, please read our documentation on [Cards](/documentation/articles/what-are-cards/).
</comp.Notice>

At the top of the *Collection browser* is the *Sort* dropdown, the *View* dropdown, and the *Collection filter* search bar. By default, Collections also have an *\+ Add* button in the top right.

From your *Collection browser*, your team members can [add files](/documentation/articles/add-a-file/), [edit files](/documentation/articles/edit-your-files/), and [delete files](/documentation/articles/delete-a-file/).
