<comp.Conditional ssgs={["Hugo"]}>
  <comp.Notice info_type="important">
    Hugo uses a CommonMark-spec Markdown engine called Goldmark. The
    CommonMark spec has no way to specify attribute lists for inline
    or block elements - and to preserve those attributes (width and
    height), we fall back to HTML when saving the image elements in
    the Markdown file.
  </comp.Notice>
</comp.Conditional>

CloudCannon automatically adds size attributes (width, height, sizes) to the HTML for images uploaded in the [Content Editor](/documentation/edit/interfaces/content-editor) and [Editable Regions](/documentation/edit/editing/html#editable-regions).

This allows browsers to size `<img>` elements before CSS and images are loaded, preventing "pop-in." Otherwise, the page can shift around in front of the viewer as images are loaded, and elements are resized.

These attributes are also required for `srcset` attributes to work properly. Browsers assume by default that the width of an image is 100vw. If the image has a `srcset` but no explicit size attributes, it will appear full width regardless of the `srcset`.

In cases where these size attributes are not right for your layout, some simple CSS can ensure that your images are sized correctly on the page. Define a width for your images, then set `height` to `auto`. This will allow the browser to calculate the appropriate height for your image based on the width.

<comp.CodeBlock language="css" source="styles.css">
```
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  You can prevent the editor adding the `width` and `height` attributes with the `image_size_attributes` option. This option can be applied to:

  * the [Content Editor](/documentation/articles/define-editable-regions-in-your-html/#image-options)
  * [Rich text inputs](/documentation/articles/using-rich-text-inputs-to-edit-your-data/#block-content)
