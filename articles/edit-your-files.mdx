Editing in CloudCannon is as easy as opening a file in one of our in-browser editing interfaces. CloudCannon will save all your changes back to your git repository.

To open a file in an editing interface, click on that file in the CloudCannon file browser.

CloudCannon supports four editing interfaces:

* [The Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-visual-editor/) — This interface offers an interactive preview of your site for editing directly onto the page.
* [The Content Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-content-editor/) — This interface offers a rich text editor useful for clean, distraction-free editing of content-heavy files.
* [The Data Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-data-editor/) — This interface offers a simple way to manage structured data and doubles as the sidebar in the Visual and Content Editors.
* [The Source Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-source-editor/) — This interface offers an in-browser code editor for minor changes ([Owner and Developer permission levels only](/documentation/articles/managing-your-team-members/)).

Depending on your SSG and site configuration, you may only have access to a subset of these editing interfaces. An editing interface may not be available because:

* Some SSGs are incompatible with the Visual Editor (e.g., Docusaurus, MkDocs).
* A Developer on your team has restricted which editing interfaces are enabled for a particular collection or schema.

## Collaborate with your team

Editing in CloudCannon is collaborative, enabling your team to create content together. In an editing session, one person can edit the file while any number of people view their edits live.

\[image\]

Team members are either *Editing* or *Viewing* a file during an editing session. While editing, all the changes you make to your file are visible to the rest of your team. While viewing, you can interact with the file in read-only mode. You can switch between *Editing* and *Viewing* with the dropdown in the top right of the editing interface.

##

CloudCannon will remember any updates you make in-app — your content is safe if you need to switch the editing interface or which team member is editing a file. However, your site will not update until you [save your changes](/documentation/articles/save-your-changes/).

## File menu

File actions are in the *File menu* dropdown in the top left of the editing interface.

\[image\]

These actions include:

* Preview live site — open this file’s [test URL](/documentation/articles/viewing-your-site-on-a-testing-domain/).
* Open with — open this file in another editing interface.
* Open Source Folder — open the source folder for this file.
* File — general actions such as Publish to posts (Jekyll only), Move, Clone, Rename, and Download.
* Discard — discard any unsaved changes made to this file.
* Delete — mark this file for deletion next time • you save your site.

You can also access these file actions in the CloudCannon file browser using the context menu button at the top right of the [file card](/documentation/articles/changing-how-cards-preview-your-data/).

## Site navigation and split-screen

You can toggle your *Site navigation* toolbar using the *Open/Close Site Navigation* button in the top left of the editing interface.

\[image\]

You can use the editing interface and file browser simultaneously using split-screen. Toggle *Split-screen* using the *Toggle Split-screen* button in the bottom left of the editing interface.

## View changed files in your file browser

You can view which files have unsaved changes in the file browser. Changed files will receive an *Edited* or *Deleted* badge on the [file card](/documentation/articles/changing-how-cards-preview-your-data/).

\[image\]

The *Edited* badge indicates that you or a team member has updated that file’s contents or recently created that file. If you rename a file, the *Edited* badge will indicate the file with the new file name. The file with the old file name will have a *Deleted* badge.

The *Deleted* badge indicates which files CloudCannon will delete from your repository the next time you save your site. You can restore deleted files any time before you [save your site](/documentation/articles/save-your-changes/) using the context menu in the top right corner of the file card.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  CloudCannon will warn you if you attempt to delete an edited file with unsaved changes. If you delete an edited file and then restore that file, CloudCannon will not restore the changes made to that file.
