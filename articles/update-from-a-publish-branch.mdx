CloudCannon will detect when you or a team member have updated your [Publish Branch](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-publish-branch/). When updates are available, a notification icon will appear on the *Publish* button in your *Site navigation*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Publish-Branch-Update-Publish-Button-Notification" alt="A screenshot of the Publish button shows that one update is available from the Publish Branch." title="The Publish Button" type="ui-snippet"/>

Updating your Site from its Publish Branch is important, especially if you have a team that separates projects into different branches that contribute to the same Publish branch. We recommend updating your site whenever an update is available, particularly if you have long-lived branches or are working on the same files across different branches.

You can update your site to match the changes made to your Publish Branch to see how your pending changes and updates from other branches work together.

To update your site from its Publish Branch:

1. Click on the *Publish* button in the *Site navigation*. CloudCannon will open the *Publishing* page.
2. On the *Updates available from your Publish Branch* notification, click the *Update this site* button and click again to confirm.

CloudCannon will attempt to update your Site from its Publish Branch.
