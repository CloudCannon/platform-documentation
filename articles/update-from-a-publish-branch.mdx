CloudCannon will detect when you or a team member have changed your Publish Branch. When updates are available, a red notification icon will appear on the *Publish* button in your *Site navigation*.

You can update your site to match the changes made to your Publish Branch to see how your pending changes and updates from other branches work together. We recommend updating your site, particularly if you have long-lived branches or are working on the same files across different branches.

To update your site:

1. Click on the *Publish* button in the *Site navigation*.
2. On the *Publishing* page, click the *Update this site* button.

CloudCannon will pull available updates from your Publish Branch.
