Connecting to your self-hosted GitLab allows you to work on your websites locally and have the changes sync to CloudCannon. File changes made on CloudCannon also get synced back to your self-hosted GitLab repository.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  To connect to a *GitLab.com* repository instead, follow the instructions listed for [GitLab](/documentation/articles/connecting-a-gitlab-respository-as-your-source/).
</comp.Notice>

### Connecting to an instance
Before syncing with a repository in your self-hosted GitLab, you need to connect CloudCannon to your self-hosted instance. You only need to do this once per account.

To connect to your self-hosted GitLab instance:

1. Go to *Settings* / *Self Hosted GitLab*
2. Enter the details for your self-hosted instance of GitLab
3. Click **Configure Self Hosted GitLab**

The details for this page come from the GitLab server under *User Settings / Applications*.

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/files-source-syncing-gitlab-settings.png" alt="Settings page from Gitlab" type="screenshot" />

The Redirect URI is [https://app.cloudcannon.com/self\_hosted\_gitlab/authorize/](https://app.cloudcannon.com/self_hosted_gitlab/authorize/) The minimal scopes required are:

1. api
2. read\_user
3. read\_repository
4. write\_repository
5. openid

Once completed, the key and secret will be available for use in CloudCannon. The URLs should match the form placeholders.

### Syncing with a repository


To connect a self-hosted GitLab repository and start syncing files, follow these instructions:

1. Go to *Site Settings* / *Source Syncing*
2. Select **Self Hosted GitLab repository**
3. Click **Authenticate**

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/self-hosted-gitlab.png" alt="Selecting self hosted GitLab as the your provider" type="screenshot" />

This redirects you to your self-hosted GitLab repository. Log in and authorize CloudCannon access to your self-hosted GitLab account. You'll be redirected back to CloudCannon to pick a repository to connect. If you don't have one for this website, create a new one in your self-hosted GitLab and refresh this page.

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/self-hosted-gitlab-selected.png" alt="Selecting self hosted GitLab repository to sync" type="screenshot" />

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Any existing files on your website will be replaced with the contents of the selected repository. Click **Backup and Sync** to continue, or exit the page to cancel the process.
</comp.Notice>

Your self-hosted GitLab is now connected. Changes you push to the Git repository are pulled in by CloudCannon. Any changes made on CloudCannon are automatically committed and pushed.

### Configuring your GitLab connection
Once you've connected your GitLab server, you can configure CloudCannon to support your particular infrastructure. You can find these configuration options under the *Server* tab of your Self Hosted GitLab settings. The options you have for configuring CloudCannon are:

* Minimum Access Level,
* Custom Headers, and
* Custom CA Certificate.

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/self-hosted-gitlab-settings.png" alt="Self Hosted GitLab settings interface" type="screenshot" />

The **Minimum Access Level** setting allows you to change the minimum
access CloudCannon requires to a GitLab repo to connect to it. By default
CloudCannon requires Maintainer access to a repo before syncing to it.
Self Hosted GitLab allows custom access level permissions so a lower
access level may be sufficient, depending on your setup.

The **Custom Headers** setting allows you to configure additional headers
for CloudCannon to use when connecting to your GitLab server. Custom
headers are passed using Git's `http.extraHeader` configuration option and in the
form `key:value`.

The **Custom CA Certificate** allows you to upload a PEM encoded
certificate or certificate chain for CloudCannon to trust during Git
operations. The certificate is passed using Git's `http.sslCAInfo`
configuration option.
