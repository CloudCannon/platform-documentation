3. In the *Choose your hosting option* dropdown, select the *Add new custom domain* option.

To see your Site content live on your domain, you will need to set up your [DNS](/documentation/articles/what-is-dns/). For more information, please read our documentation on [configuring CloudCannon DNS](/documentation/articles/using-cloudcannon-dns-to-configure-your-custom-domain/) or [configuring external DNS](/documentation/articles/using-external-dns-to-configure-your-custom-domain/).

Attach your own domain to a site on CloudCannon.

To add a custom domain:

1. Purchase a domain from a domain registrar
2. Go to the *Site Settings* / Custom *Domain* section for your site
3. Enter your domain with or without a subdomain in the *Domain Name* box
4. Click **Add Domain**

Once you have added your domain, you will see instructions for configuring your DNS and name servers.

## Subdomains

Adding a subdomain is the same as adding a Custom Domain. To add a subdomain:

1. Go to the *Site Settings* / Custom *Domain* section
2. Enter the domain including the subdomain

### Multiple Subdomains

When there are multiple sites with subdomains on the same domain, a subdomain is delegated as the main domain. All unallocated subdomains redirect to the sites with the main domain. For example:

* A site has **www.example.com** attached
* Another site has **docs.example.com** attached
* **www.example.com** is set as the main domain

Visiting any subdomain other than **www.example.com** or **docs.example.com** [will redirect](/documentation/articles/add-a-wildcard-ssl-certificate/) to **www.example.com**.

To set a site with a subdomain as the main domain:

1. Create at least two sites with the same domain and different subdomains
2. Navigate to the *Domain Settings* / *Redirects*
3. Click Set Main Domain on a site to redirect all unused subdomains there

### Configuring your domain

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Changes to DNS can take up to **48 hours** to propagate, depending on the previous TTL set. Test your site is configured correctly with the pingdom DNS checker.
</comp.Notice>

Configuration instructions are shown after adding a domain. There are two choices:

#### CloudCannon DNS (recommended)

Using **CloudCannon DNS** allows you to manage your DNS records within CloudCannon. This option automatically provides wildcard SSL certificates for your domain, so all your subdomain sites can be served over HTTPS without extra configuration.

See here for more information about [configuring CloudCannon DNS](/documentation/articles/using-cloudcannon-dns-to-configure-your-custom-domain/).

#### External DNS

If you want to manage your DNS records outside CloudCannon, you can use **External DNS**. See here for more information about [configuring external DNS](/documentation/articles/using-external-dns-to-configure-your-custom-domain/).

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  If you are using Cloudflare as your DNS provider, you will need to configure your DNS records differently. See our guide for using a Cloudflare Proxy with CloudCannon.
