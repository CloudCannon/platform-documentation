A [Custom Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/) is a unique address used to identify a website. You can purchase a Domain Name from a Domain Registrar.

To add a Custom Domain to a Site in CloudCannon:

1. Open the Site to which you want to add the Custom Domain.
2. Navigate to the *Custom Domain* page under *Site Settings*.
3. Select the *Add new custom domain* option in the *Choose your hosting option* dropdown.
4. In the *Domain Name* text field, enter the domain and tld of you want to connect to this Site (e.g., example.com).
5. Click the *Add Domain* button.

CloudCannon will connect your Custom Domain to your Site.

The domain will now appear in your *Domain browser*, which you can access from your *Organization Dashboard*.

To see your Site content live on your domain, you must set up your [DNS](/documentation/articles/what-is-dns/). For more information, please read our documentation on [configuring CloudCannon DNS](/documentation/articles/configure-cloudcannon-dns/) (recommended) or [configuring external DNS](/documentation/articles/configure-external-dns/).

We also recommend adding an [SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/) to your Site. For more information, please read our documentation on [adding an auto-generated SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/add-an-auto-generated-ssl-certificate/) or [adding a custom SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/add-a-custom-ssl-certificate/).

To stop hosting your Site on a Custom Domain, navigate to the *Danger Zone* tab on the *Custom Domain* page and click the *Remove Custom Domain* button.
