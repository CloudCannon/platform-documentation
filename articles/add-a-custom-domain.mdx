To see your Site content live on your domain, you will need to set up your [DNS](/documentation/articles/what-is-dns/). For more information, please read our documentation on [configuring CloudCannon DNS](/documentation/articles/using-cloudcannon-dns-to-configure-your-custom-domain/) (recommended) or [configuring external DNS](/documentation/articles/using-external-dns-to-configure-your-custom-domain/).

We also recommend adding an [SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/) to your Site. For more information, please read our documentation on [adding a wildcard SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/add-a-wildcard-ssl-certificate/) or [adding a custom SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/add-a-custom-ssl-certificate/).

## Add a subdomain

### Configuring your domain

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Changes to DNS can take up to **48 hours** to propagate, depending on the previous TTL set. Test your site is configured correctly with the pingdom DNS checker.
</comp.Notice>

Configuration instructions are shown after adding a domain. There are two choices:

#### CloudCannon DNS (recommended)

Using **CloudCannon DNS** allows you to manage your DNS records within CloudCannon. This option automatically provides wildcard SSL certificates for your domain, so all your subdomain sites can be served over HTTPS without extra configuration.

See here for more information about [configuring CloudCannon DNS](/documentation/articles/using-cloudcannon-dns-to-configure-your-custom-domain/).

#### External DNS

If you want to manage your DNS records outside CloudCannon, you can use **External DNS**. See here for more information about [configuring external DNS](/documentation/articles/using-external-dns-to-configure-your-custom-domain/).

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  If you are using Cloudflare as your DNS provider, you will need to configure your DNS records differently. See our guide for using a Cloudflare Proxy with CloudCannon.
