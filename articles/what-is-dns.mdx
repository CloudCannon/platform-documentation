The Domain Name System (DNS) allows your computer to translate a domain name into an IP address. Domain names are easier for users to remember and recognize than IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1 in IPv4, or 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 in IPv6).

* **Domain Name** — The unique address used to access a website (e.g., [cloudcannon.com](https://cloudcannon.com/)).
* **Internet Protocol (IP) address** — A unique string used to identify a device connected to the internet (e.g., a user's computer or phone, or the web server hosting your website).

When a users enters a domain name into their Internet browser, or clicks a link to access a website, the domain name must be translated (or resolved) to a machine-friendly IP address in a process called *DNS lookup*.

## How does DNS lookup work?

The *DNS lookup* process involves several servers, each of which contribute to translating the domain name.

* **DNS Resolver** — The server responsible for translating a domain name into an IP address. This server is maintained by the user's Internet service provider. Also known as a recursive resolver, or a DNS recursor.
* **Root Nameserver** — A u acts an an index for domain names
* **TLD Nameserver** — The server responsible for  TLD in a URL (i.e., .com, .net, .org, etc.).
* **Authoritative Nameserver** — The server responsible for maintaining the DNS records for a given domain. Often just called "the Name Server".
* **Web Server** — The server responsible for your website content.

<comp.DocsImage path="" alt="" title=""/>

In simple terms, the *DNS lookup* includes the following steps:

1. The user's browser provides the domain name of the website they want to access (e.g., cloudcannon.com) to the DNS Resolver.
2. The DNS Resolver contacts the Root Nameserver and requests...
3. The Root Nameserver replies to the DNS Resolver.
4. The DNS Resolver contacts the Top Level Domain (TLD) nameserver for the domain name and requests the Authoritative Nameserver that manages the domain name (e.g., cloudcannon.com).
5. The TLD Nameserver replies to the DNS Resolver.
6. The DNS Resolver contacts the Authoritative Nameserver  and requests the IP address that matches the domain name.
7. The Authoritative Nameserver replies to the DNS Resolver.
8. The DNS Resolver provides the correct IP address for the domain name to the user's browser.
9. The user's browser contacts the Web Server for the domain name using the IP address and request the website content.
10. The Web Server delivers the website content to the user's browser.

This process only takes milliseconds to complete, so it will not affect the user's experience on your website.

In many cases, the user's browser does not have to complete a *DNS lookup* at all, especially if the user is trying to visit a website they have been to before. After the browser has received the correct IP address for a domain name at least once, it caches that information for a period of time.

## DNS types

On CloudCannon, any Site with a [Custom Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/) can use [CloudCannon DNS](/documentation/articles/configure-cloudcannon-dns/) or an [external DNS](/documentation/articles/configure-external-dns/).

* **CloudCannon DNS** —
* **External DNS** —

CloudCannon offers free DNS services by default through Cloudflare. For more information, please read our documentation on [configuring CloudCannon DNS](/documentation/articles/configure-cloudcannon-dns/).

You can also use an external DNS provider for your Sites on CloudCannon. For more information, please read our documentation on [configuring external DNS](/documentation/articles/configure-external-dns/).

&nbsp;

* **Base Domain** — Also called root or apex domain.
* **Subdomain** — A u
* **A Records** — A u
* **CNAME Records** — A u
* **Other Records** — A u

### Configuring your domain

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Changes to DNS can take up to **48 hours** to propagate, depending on the previous TTL set. Test your site is configured correctly with the pingdom DNS checker.
</comp.Notice>

Configuration instructions are shown after adding a domain. There are two choices:

#### CloudCannon DNS (recommended)

Using **CloudCannon DNS** allows you to manage your DNS records within CloudCannon. This option automatically provides wildcard SSL certificates for your domain, so all your subdomain sites can be served over HTTPS without extra configuration.

See here for more information about [configuring CloudCannon DNS](/documentation/articles/configure-cloudcannon-dns/).

#### External DNS

If you want to manage your DNS records outside CloudCannon, you can use **External DNS**. See here for more information about [configuring external DNS](/documentation/articles/configure-external-dns/).

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  If you are using Cloudflare as your DNS provider, you will need to configure your DNS records differently. See our guide for using a Cloudflare Proxy with CloudCannon.
