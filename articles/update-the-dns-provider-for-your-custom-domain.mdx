### CloudCannon DNS records

When you enable external DNS for a Site hosted on CloudCannon, CloudCannon will ask you to add three DNS records to your DNS provider: two A Records and a CNAME Record.

The two A Records specify the IP addresses of the appropriate CloudCannon hosting servers for the your base domain. The CNAME Record will direct queries for any subdomains to CloudCannon's hosting servers.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  If you use a Cloudflare, setting up a CNAME Record for your base domain while using external DNS will result in a 1001 DNS Error.
