Removing a team member from a Permission Group will decrease the permissions they have in your Organization.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Each team member in your Organization must be a member of at least one Permission Group. If you remove a team member from the last Permission Group they were a member of, this action will also remove them from your Organization.
</comp.Notice>

There are two ways to remove a team member from a Permission Group. The best method to use will depend on whether you want to:

* Remove a specific team member from multiple Permission Groups.
* Remove multiple team members from a specific Permission Group.

## Remove a specific team member from Permission Groups

To remove a specific team member from one or more Permission Groups:

1. Navigate to the *Team* page under *Org settings*.
2. Under the *Members* tab, click on the member you want to update the permissions of. This will open their *Team member* page.
3. Identify the Permission Group from which you want to remove this team member and click on the *Context menu*.
4. Select the *Remove from Group* option from the *Context menu* dropdown.
5. Confirm that you want to remove this team member from this group by clicking the *Remove from Group* button in the confirmation modal.
