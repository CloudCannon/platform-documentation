Removing a [team member](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-team-member/) from a [Permission Group](/documentation/articles/what-are-permission-groups/) will decrease their permissions in your [Organization](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-organization/).

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Each team member in your Organization must be a member of at least one [Permission Group](/documentation/articles/what-are-permission-groups/). If you remove a team member from the last Permission Group they were a member of, this action will also remove them from your Organization.
</comp.Notice>

There are two ways to remove a team member from a Permission Group. The best method to use will depend on whether you want to:

* Remove a specific team member from multiple Permission Groups.
* Remove multiple team members from a specific Permission Group.

## Remove a specific team member from Permission Groups

To remove a specific team member from one or more Permission Groups:

1. Navigate to the *Team* page under *Org settings*.
2. Under the *Members* tab, click on the member whose permissions you want to update. This will open their *Team member* page.
3. Identify the Permission Group from which you want to remove this team member and click on the *Context Menu*.
4. Select the *Remove from Group* option from the *Context Menu* dropdown.
5. Confirm that you want to remove this team member from this Group by clicking the *Remove from Group* button in the confirmation modal.
