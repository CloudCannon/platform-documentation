Transfer the ownership of a site to another Organization.

Transferring a site will transfer all data and resources required to run that site. This may include SSL certificates, domain names, and other sites under the same domain.

Transfers are a two-step process; transfer requests and transfer confirmation.

## Initiating a transfer
To begin transferring a site:

1. Go to *Site Settings* / *Transfer Site*
2. **Select** an organization to transfer the site to
3. At the bottom of the page, click **Send Transfer Request**
4. Click again to confirm

Once the transfer request has been sent, the receiving account must accept the transfer. If you are an owner/administrator of the Organization you are transferring to, the transfer is automatically accepted.
