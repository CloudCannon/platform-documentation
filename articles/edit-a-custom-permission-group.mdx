## Add a permission to a Custom Permission Group

To add a permission to an existing [Custom Permission Group](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/):

1. Navigate to the *Team* page under *Org settings*.
2. Click on the *Groups* tab.
3. Under the *Groups* tab, click on the Permission Group you want to delete. This will open the *Permission Group* page.
4. Click on the *Settings* tab.
5. Click on the *Add permission* button at the bottom of the page. This will open the *Add a new permission* modal.
6. Select whether this permission is an [exception](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/#exceptions).
7. Select the scope for this permission. If you select Project, Site, Group, or Base Domain, you must also choose the target to that scope. Selecting a scope will automatically filter the resource tree.
8. Select the resources you want to add and what actions you want to allow for each resource (i.e., Read, Write, or Create).
9. Click the *Add permission* button.
10. Once you are happy with the changes to your Permission Group, click the *Update group* button.

CloudCannon will add the new permission to your Custom Permission Group. All members of that group will automatically gain the new permission.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Alternatively, you can add a new permission by cloning an existing permission. This method is more efficient when you need to create many similar permissions (e.g., several permissions with a Site scope targeting different Sites).

  To clone permission, click on the *Context menu* and select *Clone permission*. You can now edit the cloned permission.
