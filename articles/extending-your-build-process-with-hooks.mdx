Bash scripts that run at different stages in the build to extend the functionality of your sites. There are three hooks available: Preinstall, Prebuild, and PostBuild. All three are configured using extensionless script files.

To run a hook script:

1. Create one of the named files in the `.cloudcannon` folder at the root of your file structure
2. Enter the commands you want to run at the specified step

### Preinstall

A script at `/.cloudcannon/preinstall` which runs after the files are available and before any install scripts.

Preinstall scripts are useful for configuring your install commands before they run.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  CloudCannon does not have pnpm preinstalled. However, you can use `/.cloudcannon/preinstall` to add pnpm to your build/install commands.
</comp.Notice>

### Prebuild

A script at `/.cloudcannon/prebuild` which runs after the install scripts and before any build commands.

Prebuild commands allow you to incorporate your favourite tools for building and pre-processing into CloudCannon. Some ideas for using this feature include:

* Bundling JavaScript
* Fetching API data
* Running build commands outside of your SSG
* Sending messages to your Slack channel

Hereâ€™s an example file that bundles JavaScript files using webpack:

<comp.CodeBlock language="shell" source="/.cloudcannon/prebuild">
```
#!/bin/bash

npm install webpack
npm install webpack-cli

./node_modules/.bin/webpack path/to/entry.js -o js/output.js
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

### Postbuild

A script at `/.cloudcannon/postbuild` which runs after your build is completed successfully before the files are uploaded to CloudCannon servers.

Postbuild scripts are useful for augmenting your built output or running postbuild webhooks.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  If your `postbuild` script adds, removes or updates files used by the editor, your editing experience may be compromised.
</comp.Notice>
