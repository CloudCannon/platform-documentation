An output URL is the URL CloudCannon outputs your files to during a [Site build](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-site-build/). Each output file will have a unique URL path, made of a subpath (optional) and a slug. The domain section of each URL will be the name of your [Testing Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-testing-domain/), or [Custom Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/) if you have one configured.

An output URL is required for your webpages to be output to your [Testing Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-testing-domain/) or [Custom Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/), as well as for the webpage previews used in the [Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-visual-editor/). When you build your *Site*, CloudCannon will automatically determine the unique URL path for each output file.

In CloudCannon, output URLs are configured using a template string, which contains plain text and placeholder values. Placeholder values enable you to utilize structured data from your files within the *Collection*. By default, CloudCannon uses the template string `/collection/[slug]/`, with the name of the *Collection* as the subpath (unless it is the "Pages" *Collection*).

If, after a *Site* build, your files are output to an incorrect URL, you can [update the output URL for a Collection](/documentation/articles/update-the-output-url-for-a-collection/) to a different template string in your *Collection Browser* using *Configuration Mode*.

You may not want some *Collections* to output to a URL. By default, CloudCannon does not output *Collections* named `data` or `_data`. However, you can [disable the output URL for a Collection](/documentation/articles/disable-the-output-url-for-a-collection/) at any time in your *Collection Browser* using *Configuration Mode*.
