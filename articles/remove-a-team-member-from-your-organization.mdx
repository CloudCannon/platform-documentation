<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  You can remove multiple people from your Organization at once by deleting a Permission Group. This only works if:

  * You have Custom Permission Groups, AND
  * All the team members you want to remove from your Organization are only members of a single Permission Group.

  For more information, please read our documentation on [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/).
