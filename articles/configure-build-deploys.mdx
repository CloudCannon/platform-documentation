You can deploy built files from CloudCannon to a Git repository. This feature is useful if you want to edit and [build your files](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-site-build/) on CloudCannon, but host your website using a third-party service or private infrastructure.

To configure your build deploys, you must connect a Git repository. CloudCannon supports the Git providers Bitbucket, GitHub, and GitLab. You can also configure additional settings, such as which step of your build to commit after and whether to exclude any file paths from the deploy.

## Connect a Git repository

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  You must create a repository through your Git provider before you can select it in CloudCannon.
</comp.Notice>

To connect a Git repository:

1. Navigate to the *Build Deploys* page under *Site Settings*.
2. Click on the *Git Provider* dropdown and select your provider. If you have not authenticated your Git provider connection, click the *Authenticate* button to do so.
3. Click on the *Repository* dropdown and select your repository.
4. Under *Branch Setup*, select the *Use an existing branch* radio button and click on the *Branch* dropdown to select the branch you want to deploy to. Alternatively, select the *Create a new branch* radio button, click on the *Source branch* dropdown to select an existing branch to copy, and enter the name for your new branch in the *New branch name* text field.
5. Click the *Connect and Sync* button. WARNING: Clicking this button will overwrite the branch you connect with built files from your Site. Please ensure that your selected repository and branch is correct.

CloudCannon will sync the built files from your Site to the connected Git repository. After every build, CloudCannon will sync the built files with your Git repository.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Settings-Build-Deploys-Empty" alt="A screenshot of the Build Deploys page under Site Settings shows a dropdown for selecting your Git provider." title="The Build Deploys page" type="screenshot"/>

You can view previous deploys by clicking the *View deploy history* button, or navigate to the *Build Deploys* tab on the *Status* page.

You can change the repository branch at any time by clicking the *Change branch* button, selecting a new branch in the *Change branch* modal, and clicking the *Change branch* button.

You can disconnect your Git repository by clicking the *Disconnect* button.

## Additional build deploy settings

* **Build**: Once built, your site will be synced to your output repository before any further work is done on it.
* **I18n**: Sync your built site after translations have been performed on it.
* **Process**: Sync your built site after encrypting form details.
* **Compress**: Sync your built site after assets have been minified.

Configure a Build Deploy to commit the built version of your site to a repository. With a Build Deploy you can have CloudCannon handle your build and easily deploy the site to your own infrastructure.

## Adding a Build Deploy

1. First, create a repository that you would like to sync your site to, and connect it to a git provider.
2. Go to *Site Settings* / *Build Deploys* and choose your provider from the dropdown. If you have not yet authenticated CloudCannon with your provider, you will be prompted to do so.
3. Once authenticated, choose your repository from the dropdown, and choose an existing branch or create a new one.
4. Click **Connect and Sync** in the top right of the page.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Your chosen branch will be overwritten once connected as a Build Deploy. Please ensure your chosen repository + branch is correct before proceeding.
</comp.Notice>

Once connected, your most recently compiled site will replace the contents of the configured branch. This process will repeat after every build.

You can change the what part of the build step is synced after selecting the provider. By default, the compiled output of the build step is synced.

## Select a Deploy Step

Once you have connected to your repository, you can select which build step you would like to be synced.

Go to *Site Settings* / *Build Deploys* and click the dropdown menu under *Deploy Step*. Select from one of the following:

* **Build**: Once built, your site will be synced to your output repository before any further work is done on it.
* **I18n**: Sync your built site after translations have been performed on it.
* **Process**: Sync your built site after encrypting form details.
* **Compress**: Sync your built site after assets have been minified.

Then click **Update Build Deploy**.

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/files-output-github.png" alt="Output Providers interface" title="" type="screenshot"/>

These options are listed in build-order. For example, selecting **Process** will sync your site once it has been built, translated, and processed, but before CloudCannon performs any compression.

In some cases the repo you're deploying to may contain special files you don't want to be overwritten by your deploy. The Excluded Paths setting allows you to specify a comma separated list of file prefixes, files matching one of these prefixes will not be updated by CloudCannon.

In the case that a file exists in your repo but not as part of your build, adding it as an excluded path will prevent if from being deleted by a deploy.

## Removing a Build Deploy

Go to *Site Settings* / *Build Deploys* and click **Disconnect &lt;Provider&gt;**.
