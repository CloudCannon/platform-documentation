You can deploy built files from CloudCannon to a Git repository, also called an "output repository". This feature is useful if you want to edit and [build your files](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-site-build/) on CloudCannon, but host your website using a third-party service or private infrastructure.

To configure your build deploys, you must connect a Git repository. CloudCannon supports the Git providers Bitbucket, GitHub, and GitLab. You can also configure additional settings, such as which step of your build to commit after and whether to exclude any file paths from the deploy.

## Connect a Git repository

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  You must create a repository through your Git provider before you can select it in CloudCannon.
</comp.Notice>

To connect a Git repository:

1. Navigate to the *Build Deploys* page under *Site Settings*.
2. Click on the *Git Provider* dropdown and select your provider. If you have not authenticated your Git provider connection, click the *Authenticate* button to do so.
3. Click on the *Repository* dropdown and select your repository.
4. Under *Branch Setup*, select the *Use an existing branch* radio button and click on the *Branch* dropdown to select the branch you want to deploy to. Alternatively, select the *Create a new branch* radio button, click on the *Source branch* dropdown to select an existing branch to copy, and enter the name for your new branch in the *New branch name* text field.
5. Click the *Connect and Sync* button. WARNING: Clicking this button will overwrite the branch you connect with built files from your Site. Please ensure that your selected repository and branch is correct.

CloudCannon will sync the built files from your Site to the connected Git repository. After every build, CloudCannon will sync the built files with your Git repository.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Settings-Build-Deploys-Empty" alt="A screenshot of the Build Deploys page under Site Settings shows a dropdown for selecting your Git provider." title="The Build Deploys page" type="screenshot"/>

You can view previous deploys by clicking the *View deploy history* button, or navigate to the *Build Deploys* tab on the *Status* page.

You can change the repository branch at any time by clicking the *Change branch* button, selecting a new branch in the *Change branch* modal, and clicking the *Change branch* button.

You can disconnect your Git repository by clicking the *Disconnect* button.

## Additional build deploy settings

Once you have connected a Git repository, you can configure additional build settings such as *Deploy Step* and *Excluded Paths*.

You can select when CloudCannon should deploy to your output repository, after the *Build* step, *Process* step, or *Compress* step.

* **Build** — Deploy files to your output repository after a successful build.
* **Process** — Deploy files to your output repository after encrypting form details.
* **Compress** — Deploy files to your output repository after CloudCannon has minified your assets. For more information, please read our documentation on [optimizing your Site](/documentation/articles/optimize-your-site/).

These steps occur consecutively. If you select the *Process* step, CloudCannon will deploy your files after a successful build and form encryption, but before minifying assets.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  CloudCannon also supports the legacy I18n option to deploy to your output repository after CloudCannon translates your content.

  If you use I18n to translate your website content, we recommend switching to [Rosey](/documentation/guides/rosey-migration-guide/).
</comp.Notice>

You can also exclude specific paths from your build deploy. This is beneficial if there are pathways you don't want CloudCannon to overwrite.

You can add the `?` and `*` wild card characters to your file paths.

* `?` — Use the question mark character to specify any single character.
* `*` — Use the asterisk character to specify and string, including an empty string.

For example, `/github/` will exclude all files in the github folder, `/assets/images/frame-??.jpg` will exclude all files between "frame-00" and "frame-99" in the configuration folder, and `/assets/images/*.jpg` will exclude all JPEG files in the images folder.

To configure additional build deploy settings:

1. &nbsp;Navigate to the *Build Deploys* page under *Site Settings*.
2. Select which step CloudCannon should deploy after using the *Deploy Step* dropdown.
3. Enter any paths you want to exclude from the deploy in the *Excluded Paths* text field. To exclude multiple paths, please use a comma separated list.
4. Click the *Update Build Deploy* button.

CloudCannon will update your build deploy settings.
