Share a site with others by creating Collaborators.

Collaborators are other CloudCannon users you have given access to one or more sites. Collaborators have two different share levels:

*Editors* make content changes with the [Visual Editor](/documentation/edit/interfaces/visual-editor/), [Content Editor](/documentation/edit/interfaces/content-editor/), and *Explore* section. They have access to the recent activity in the *Reports* section. The [Source Editor](/documentation/edit/interfaces/source-editor/), *Site Settings*, and *File Browser* are hidden and inaccessible.

*Technical Editors* have access to all files, but the *Site Settings* are hidden and inaccessible.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  To give someone access to all sites on your organization, consider [adding them as a team member](/documentation/articles/managing-your-team-members/) to your organization instead.
</comp.Notice>

To share a site with a collaborator:

1. Go to the *Site Settings* / *Collaborators* section

3. Enter the user’s email address and select their permission level
4. Click **Add Collaborator**

Any user that does not yet have a CloudCannon account will show in the *Pending User *section. Once they sign up, they will have access to the site.

#### Managing collaborator access
To remove user’s access or change their share level, click the three dots to the right of their user information. From the dropdown, choose to either update their permissions or revoke their access.
