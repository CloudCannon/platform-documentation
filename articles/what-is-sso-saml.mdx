CloudCannon supports Single Sign-On (SSO) using a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for customers on our [Enterprise plan](/pricing/). SSO/SAML provides a way to authenticate your team through an external application and communicate that authentication to CloudCannon.

* **User** — The team member who wants to access CloudCannon.
* **Identity Provider** — The cloud software that will authenticate the user’s identity. An Identity Provider could be an internal software or an external service, like [Okta](/documentation/articles/configure-sso-saml-with-okta/). A member of your Organization already has a login for this software.
* **Service Provider** — The cloud application a user wants to log in to (i.e., CloudCannon).

With SSO/SAML, rather than logging in to CloudCannon directly, CloudCannon will authenticate the user’s identity using their Identity Provider software. While the user is logged in to their Identity Provider, they do not need to enter their CloudCannon password to log in. Instead, they can click a button, and CloudCannon will confirm their identity with their Identity Provider.

When you have a large team, managing their access can be tricky. SSO can benefit your enterprise in several ways. With SSO, you can:

* Reduce the number of password resets due to forgotten passwords.
* Improve the user experience with seamless access to many applications.
* Revoke access in a single location and know you have removed access to multiple applications.

SSO is also required for some security and compliance policies, as it reduces password-related vulnerabilities and puts authentication in the hands of a single Identity Provider rather than many applications.
