### Navigation Header

* **Projects dropdown** — If your Site is part of a [Project](https://smooth-tank.cloudvent.net/documentation/articles/create-a-project/), the *Projects dropdown* shows you which Project your Site belongs to and which Sites (if any) it publishes to.
* **Site icon, Site name, and branch name** — These are your basic Site details, so you know which Site you are editing.
* **Avatars** — The avatars for any team members active on your Site. Clicking on an avatar will show a list of files they have open, with an eye icon for file they are *Viewing* and a pencil for *Editing*.
* **The Save button** — Opens the *Review your changes* modal and allows you to commit changes to your Git repository.
* **The Publish button** — If your Site has a [publish branch](https://smooth-tank.cloudvent.net/documentation/articles/connect-a-publish-branch/), this button allows you to create a Pull Request or immediately merge your changes from this Site to any Sites it publishes to.
* **The Live site preview button** — Opens your [Testing Domain](https://smooth-tank.cloudvent.net/documentation/articles/viewing-your-site-on-a-testing-domain/) or your [Custom Domain](https://smooth-tank.cloudvent.net/documentation/articles/hosting-your-site-on-a-custom-domain/), if you have one.

The site navigation menu appears when you open a site in CloudCannon.

At the very top of the navigation are your site icon, name, and site URL. Depending on your hosting settings, this URL will be either a preview domain, a staging domain, or a custom domain.

You can use the site navigation to access your site, including your pages, collections, data, and site settings. You'll also find handy Dashboards and a browser for all of the files that make up your site.

## Navigation sections

All site navigations will have three sections: Dashboards, Collections, and Developer. The first, Dashboard, and the last, Developer, appear by default. The middle section is fully configurable (the image above is configured for Pages and Blogging Collections). We'll cover how to configure Dashboards in the next section.

### Default Navigation Sections

Your Dashboard will show a couple of default rows, with others available based on your site setup. In contrast, your Developer section will show the same four default rows for every site.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  The Developer section is only available for specific team members, based on their roles. This means that content editors will not be able to make high-level site changes.
</comp.Notice>

#### Dashboard rows

* **Home** — Includes your URL, a preview of your site, and a summary of recent activity on your site in CloudCannon.
* **Usage** — Charts tracking your Bandwidth and Build Time usage for the month.
* **Publishing** — Use Publishing to review changes and merge your staging site or page back to your main branch.
* **Inbox** — Read, review, and respond to form submissions within CloudCannon.

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/editing-navigation-site-navigation-dashboards@2.png" alt="Snippet of the Dashboard section in the Site Navigation" title="" type="screenshot-snippet"/>

#### Developer rows

* **Status** — A summary of your site's build, syncing, and hosting status.
* **Files** — All of your site files, easily browsable.
* **Reports** — Detailed reports of site activity and builds.
* **Settings** — Your site settings, including configuration for files, builds, hosting, and sharing.

### Configurable Navigation Section

The list of panels in your site is configurable in your site and build information. CloudCannon gives you plenty of opportunities to define the order, type, and information of items displayed in these panels. Learn more about how to change the items in your site navigation.

**Collections section**

You can define, add, rename, and group collections in your configuration settings.

* **Pages** — By default, all of your site's pages will appear here.
* **Blogging** — Default with a blog included.
  * **Posts** — A library of your published blog articles.
  * **Drafts** — All of your unpublished blog articles.
* **Collections/data** — Set of custom content defined by your setup or data file. Examples of collections might include products, staff members, or articles.

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/editing-navigation-site-navigation-collections@2.png" alt="Snippet of the collections section in the Site Navigation." title="" type="screenshot-snippet"/>

CloudCannon groups your collections, pages, and data in your site's navigation. You can reorder, show/hide, and regroup sections with `collection_groups` in your global configuration file.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
```

collection_groups:
  - heading: Blogging
    collections:
      - posts
      - drafts
  - heading: Other
    collections:
      - pages
      - staff
      - features

```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

## Configure dashboard actions

The CloudCannon dashboard has an actions section for quickly navigating to specific pages.

### Update Home

The *Update Home* button will open your home page (or any page of your choice) in the [Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-visual-editor). This is configured in your [global configuration file](/documentation/articles/create-a-global-configuration-file/) using the key `default_path` within `editor`.

To configure which path this button will open, use the relative URL of the page.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
```

editor:
  default_path: /about/

```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

Clicking the **Update Home** dashboard action loads the `default_path`. The example above loads `/about/` rather than the default `/`.
