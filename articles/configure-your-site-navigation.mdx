## Navigation Sections

### Navigation Header

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/editing/navigation/2024-10/CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Navigation-Header.png" alt="A screenshot of the Site Navigation header shows the projects dropdown, SIte information, avatars, and other tools." title="The Site Navigation header" type="ui-snippet"/>

The *Site Navigation* Header contains basic information about your Site, which team members are using your Site, and tools to save, publish, and view your Site.

* **Projects dropdown** — If your Site is part of a [Project](https://smooth-tank.cloudvent.net/documentation/articles/create-a-project/), the *Projects dropdown* shows you which Project your Site belongs to and which Sites (if any) it publishes to.
* **Site icon, Site name, and branch name** — These are your basic Site details, so you know which Site you are editing.
* **Avatars** — The avatars for any [team members](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-team-member/) active on your Site. Clicking on an avatar will show a list of files they have open, with an eye icon for file they are *Viewing* and a pencil for *Editing*.
* **The Save button** — Opens the *Review your changes* modal and allows you to [save changes](/documentation/articles/save-your-changes/) to your Git repository.
* **The Publish button** — If your Site has a [publish branch](https://smooth-tank.cloudvent.net/documentation/articles/connect-a-publish-branch/), this button allows you to create a Pull Request or immediately merge your changes from this Site to any Sites it publishes to.
* **The Live site preview button** — Opens your [Testing Domain](https://smooth-tank.cloudvent.net/documentation/articles/viewing-your-site-on-a-testing-domain/) or your [Custom Domain](https://smooth-tank.cloudvent.net/documentation/articles/hosting-your-site-on-a-custom-domain/), if you have one.

Some of these sections may not appear depending on your Site's configuration. For example, the *Live site preview* button is not applicable to Sites in [Headless Mode](/documentation/articles/what-is-headless-mode/).

### Dashboard and Inbox

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/editing/navigation/2024-10/CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Navigation-Dashboard-Inbox.png" alt="A screenshot of the Site Navigation shows links to the Dashboard and Inbox pages." title="The Site Navigation" type="ui-snippet"/>

At the top of the scrollable section in your *Site Navigation* are the links to the *Dashboard* and *Inbox* pages.

* **Site Dashboard** — Your Site home page, showing a preview of your last build and recent activity on your Site.
* **Inbox** — If your Site has a [form](/documentation/articles/getting-started-with-forms-on-cloudcannon/), this button opens the *Inbox* page for your form. If you can multiple forms, each inbox will appear as separate items in your *Site Navigation* under the *Inboxes* heading.

### Collections

In the middle of the scrollable section in your *Site Navigation* are the links for your Collections.

* **Collections** — Groups of related content, such as a folder of blog articles, Staff Member profiles, or product pages.

By default, CloudCannon will sort your Collections in the following order: the *Pages* Collection, all output Collections in alphabetical order, then all non-output Collections in alphabetical order.

You can configure the order of your Collections using the [Collection Groups](/documentation/articles/configure-your-site-navigation/#collection_groups) option.

### Developer Tools

&nbsp;

* **Status** — Tools for managing your Site, including the *Status* page, file browser, and *Site Settings*.
* **Files** — Tools for managing your Site, including the *Status* page, file browser, and *Site Settings*.
* **Site Settings** — Tools for managing your Site, including the *Status* page, file browser, and *Site Settings*.
