## What are template strings?

Template strings are a mixture of literal text and dynamic placeholders that are replaced with data. You can use template strings to populate complex strings.

Template strings are commonly used in:

* [Configuring your Create paths for new files](/documentation/articles/set-the-path-for-new-files/)
* [Configuring your Uploads paths for new assets](/documentation/articles/adjusting-the-uploads-path/)
* [Configuring your card previews](/documentation/articles/configure-your-card-previews/)
* [Configuring your commit messages](/documentation/articles/configure-your-commit-messages/)

Please read these articles for more specific information about the best placeholders for each use case.

## Placeholders

Placeholders reference front matter or data values. When CloudCannon reads a placeholder, it will replace the content with the data it references.

There are two types of placeholders.

* **Data placeholder** — Reads data you defined in your front matter or other data values. These placeholders use `{ }` brackets.
* **Fixed placeholder** — Reads fixed data defined by CloudCannon. These placeholders use `[ ]` brackets.

## Filters

Placeholders support several filters. Filters occur after the placeholder key, with a `|` character separating each key and filter. You can use multiple filters in sequence.

### Generic filters

* `uppercase` transforms text to uppercase
* `lowercase` transforms text to lowercase
* `deburr` converts Latin-1 Supplement and Latin Extended-A letters to basic Latin letters and removes combining diacritical marks.
* `slugify` converts non-alphanumeric characters into hyphens, then collapses sequential hyphens, then removes leading/trailing and hyphens.
* `trim` removes leading and trailing whitespace

### Date filters

* `year` gets a 4-digit year from a date
* `month` gets a 2-digit month from a date
* `day` gets a 4-digit day from a date
* `time` gets the time from a date, in a 12-hour format (e.g. 12:30pm)
* `timezone` gets the timezone from a date
* `date_short` gets a short date format (e.g. 7/12/2022)
* `date_medium` gets a medium date format (e.g. 7 Dec 2022)
* `date_long` gets a long date format (e.g. 7 December 2022)
* `date_full` gets a longer date format (e.g. Tuesday, 7 December 2022)
* `time` gets the time (e.g. 1:00pm)
* `time_short` gets a short time format (e.g. 1:00 pm)
* `time_medium` gets a medium time format (e.g. 1:00:00 pm)
* `time_long` gets a long time format (e.g. 1:00:00 pm NZDT)
* `time_full` gets a longer time format (e.g. 1:00:00 pm New Zealand Daylight Time)

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  All the time and date filters format the date using the site's timezone and the user's locale.
</comp.Notice>

### Filters with parameters

For some filters, you can provide extra parameters for more flexibility. Add extra parameters by including a `=` character after the filter name.

* `truncate` removes and extra characters beyond a specified number. For example, `{title|truncate=10}` will resolve to the first 10 characters of a message.
* `default` allows you to provide a fallback value, in case the data is empty
* `if` resolves to the data, if the parameter is "truthy"
* `unless` resolves to the data, if the parameter is "falsy"

### Filtering examples

Let's go through some examples for the following file:

<comp.CodeBlock language="yaml" source="short-message.mdx">
```

date: 2020-01-02
empty_value:
message: "Hello World"
draft: false

```
</comp.CodeBlock>

In the above file we have four keys containing different data types: `date`, `empty_value`, `message`, and `draft`.

Here are some examples of how we can transform this data using different filters:

<comp.CodeBlock language="annotated">
```

{date|day}-{date|month}-{date|year} {date|time} ({date|timezone}) #1
// 01-02-2020 00:00am (Etc/UTC)

{message|uppercase|truncate=5} #2
// HELLO

{message|if=message} #3
// Hello World

{message|unless=empty_value} #4
// Hello World

{empty_value|default="Nothing here!"} #5
// Nothing here!

{"Unpublished"|if=draft|default="Published"} #6
// Published

```
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  We can use multiple date filters to control the output string. This template string uses dynamic data placeholders and literal text characters, such as `-` and `()`.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="2">
  We can convert text strings to `uppercase` and `truncate` the number of characters to five.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="3">
  We can print the value of a key if a value exists using the `if` filter.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="4">
  We can print the value of a key based on the value of another key using the `unless` filter. In this case, we print the value of `message` because `empty_value` is falsy.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="5">
  We can create a fallback option when a placeholder resolves to an empty result using the `default` filter. In this case, "Nothing here!" is printed because `empty_value` contains no value.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="6">
  We can use multiple filters to check if a key contains a value and create a fallback string if that key is falsy.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>

### Filtering nested keys and arrays

Data placeholders can reference nested keys in your front matter or other data values.

Here is an example file:

<comp.CodeBlock language="YAML">
```

links:
  - url: /documentation
    text: Learn more
  - url: /blog
    text: Read more
  - url:
    text:
seo:
  description: Description goes here
  tags:
    - 'sales'
    - 'documentation'

```
</comp.CodeBlock>

In the above file, we have several nested keys and arrays. You can reference these keys in a template string by using the relative path of the key, by specifying the position within an array, or by searching each item in an array using `[*]`.

Here are some examples of how we can transform this data using different filters:

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  When you use `[*]` to reference each item within an array, CloudCannon will join the final output into a single string, separating each value with a comma and a space.
</comp.Notice>

<comp.CodeBlock language="annotated">
```

{seo.description} #1
// Description goes here

{links.text[0].description} #2
// Learn more

{seo.tags[*]|uppercase} #3
// SALES, DOCUMENTATION

{links[*].text|default="No text"} #4
// Learn more, Read more, No text

```
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  We can print the value of a nested key.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="2">
  We can print the value of a specific key within an array.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="3">
  We can print the value of every item within an array and filter the result with `uppercase`. CloudCannon automatically joins the final output into a single string.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="4">
  We can search an array using and print the value of a key each time it appears in that array. If one key is empty, we can use a fallback value using the `default` filter.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>
