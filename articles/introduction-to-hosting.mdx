A Custom Domain is a unique address used to identify a website. For example, CloudCannon's domain is [cloudcannon.com](https://cloudcannon.com/). The domain is the part of your URL that users are most likely to remember. To host on CloudCannon, you need to connect your Custom Domain to your Organization.
