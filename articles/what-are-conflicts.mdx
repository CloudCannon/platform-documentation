In CloudCannon, conflicts arise when multiple people try to update the same file, or part of a file, in a way that conflicts with each other. When CloudCannon detects a conflict, it is important to resolve it by choosing which version of your file to keep.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Conflicts aren't dangerous to your content or website — they're CloudCannon's way of letting you know that there are two versions of your file, and that you need to choose how to proceed.
</comp.Notice>

There are two types of conflicts you can encounter in CloudCannon:

* **Publishing conflict** — When changes to a file on your Site conflict with incoming changes to the same file from your [Publish Branch](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-publish-branch/).
* **Syncing conflict** — When unsaved changes to a file on your Site conflict with incoming changes to the same file from a different CloudCannon Site or your git repository.

CloudCannon will warn you when it detects a conflict using a notification in your *Site Navigation* or on the *Publishing* page.

## Publishing conflicts

Publishing conflicts can occur when you <a href="/documentation/articles/connect-a-publish-branch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connect a Publish Branch</a> to your Site. A Publish Branch is the copy of your Site to which you publish your changes. Connecting a Publish Branch allows you to work on your website using a separate copy without your changes going public until you are ready.

Multiple Sites can contribute to the same Publish Branch. A publishing conflict occurs when you or a team member have updated the same file on different branches that contribute to the same Publish Branch. When one Site publishes to the Publish Branch first, the other Site must update. CloudCannon will detect that there are conflicting versions of the same file.

Let's go through an example.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/publishing/what-is-a-publish-branch/2025-03/CloudCannon-Documentation-Branching-Workflow-Diagram.png" alt="A diagram of a branching workflow shows three project branches publish to the Staging Branch, which publishes to the Live Website branch." title="Branching Workflow Diagram" type="photo"/>

In the diagram above, three Sites contribute to the same Publish Branch: one for writing a new blog, one for removing a product page, and one for updating the Site navigation. Deleting the product page and updating the navigation both require our team to make changes to the `/products/` page: one team member removes a link from that page, and another renames the page to `/services/`, effectively deleting the `/products/` page and replacing it with the new `/services/` page. These changes conflict with each other.

The team member updating the website navigation finishes first and publishes their changes to the Publish Branch: "Staging Website." We are working on removing the product page, and before we can publish it to the staging website, CloudCannon will prompt us to <a href="/documentation/articles/update-from-a-publish-branch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update from our publishing branch</a>. When we try to update, CloudCannon detects conflicting versions of the `/products/` file: on our Site, we have changed a link, but on the Publish Branch, the `/products/` page doesn't exist anymore.

Before we can publish our changes, we need to tell CloudCannon which version of the file to keep: the changes on our current Site, the incoming changes from the Publish Branch, or a hybrid of the two.
