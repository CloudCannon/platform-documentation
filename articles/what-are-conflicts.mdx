In CloudCannon, conflicts occur when two people, one on a CloudCannon Site, and another on a different CloudCannon Site or using their local development environment, try to update the same file or part of a file in a way that conflicts with each other. When CloudCannon detects a conflict, it is important to resolve it by choosing which version of your file to keep.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Conflicts aren't dangerous to your content or website — they're CloudCannon's way of letting you know that there are two versions of your file, and that you need to choose how to proceed.
</comp.Notice>

There are two types of conflicts you can encounter in CloudCannon: Syncing Conflicts and Publishing Conflicts.

* **Syncing Conflict** — When incoming changes to a file from a different CloudCannon Site or your git repository affect a file on your Site with unsaved changes.
* **Publishing Conflict** — When incoming changes to a file from your [Publish Branch](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-publish-branch/) conflict with changes to the same file on your Site.
* **Incoming changes** — These are changes to your Site files originating from outside the branch you are working on, such as from a different CloudCannon Site or your git repository. All incoming changes are made by a member of your team.

CloudCannon will warn you when it detects a conflict using a notification on the *Save* or *Publish* button in your *Site Navigation*, in the *Review changes* modal, or on the *Publishing* page.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  **What is the difference between a Syncing Conflict and a Publishing Conflict?**

  A Syncing Conflict occurs when there are two versions of the same file on the same branch, one on your CloudCannon Site and one on your Git repository.

  A Publishing Conflict occurs when there are two versions of the same file on two different but connected branches, one on your CloudCannon Site and one on your Publish Branch.
</comp.Notice>

## Syncing Conflicts

CloudCannon is constantly monitoring your branch in your Git repository. When someone saves a change to your branch, CloudCannon will sync that change to all CloudCannon Sites connected to that branch by overwriting the version of your file on your Site with the version from your Git repository. This behavior keeps your CloudCannon Site up to date with your Git repository.

A Syncing Conflict occurs when you have unsaved changes to a file, and CloudCannon tries to sync an update to that file from your Git repository.

To prevent incoming changes from your Git repository from overwriting your unsaved changes, CloudCannon will stop attempting to sync your files and alert you to the Syncing Conflict. CloudCannon will notify you about a Syncing Conflict using the *Conflicts* warning notification above the *Save* button in your *Site Navigation*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Save-Button-Syncing-Conflict-Notification" alt="A screenshot of the Save Button in the Site Navigation shows a Conflicts warning notification in the top right." title="The Save Button" type="ui-snippet"/>

You must resolve the Syncing Conflict before CloudCannon will allow you to save any changes to non-conflicted files. For more information, please read our documentation on [resolving Syncing Conflicts](/documentation/articles/resolve-syncing-conflicts/).

### Example

Let's go through an example of how a Syncing Conflict can occur.

We want to update the copy on our About webpage, so we open the `about.md` file in CloudCannon and start making changes. Coincidentally, another team member is also updating the `about.md` file at the same time. Our team member is a developer who is fixing some broken [inputs](/documentation/articles/what-are-inputs/) on several webpages, including the About page, using their local development environment.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  There are two ways to edit the same branch without being on the same CloudCannon Site.

  One, you could connect the same branch to more than one CloudCannon Site. Normally, each branch in your Git repository is connected to one Site in CloudCannon. However, you can connect multiple CloudCannon Sites to a single branch if that suits your workflow (e.g., you have multiple websites in a single Git repository, or "monorepo").

  Two, you could edit the same branch using a CloudCannon Site, your local development environment, or directly through your Git provider simultaneously. It's common for content creators to use CloudCannon to update their website, while developers use their local development environment or Git provider.
</comp.Notice>

Before we can finish making our changes, our team member saves their changes to our website's Git repository. Our Git provider alerts CloudCannon that someone has updated several files and that CloudCannon should sync the version of those files available on our Git repository to all connected CloudCannon Sites.

Because we have the About page open with unsaved changes, CloudCannon will block the syncing attempt and notify us about the Syncing Conflict on the *Save* button and in the *Review changes* modal.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Incoming changes from the Git repository can involve multiple files. CloudCannon will block the sync of all incoming changes for all file if one or more files have unsaved changes.
</comp.Notice>

Before we can save any changes to other files or complete the sync to update all our files with incoming changes, we need to resolve the Syncing Conflict for `about.md`.

## Publishing Conflicts

Publishing Conflicts can occur when you <a href="/documentation/articles/connect-a-publish-branch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connect a Publish Branch</a> to your Site. A [Publish Branch](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-publish-branch/) is the copy of your Site to which you publish your changes.

Multiple Sites can contribute to the same Publish Branch. When someone publishes a change to your Publish Branch from another Site or branch, CloudCannon will notify you that an [update is available from your Publish Branch](/documentation/articles/update-from-a-publish-branch/).

CloudCannon is constantly monitoring your branch in your Git repository. When someone saves a change to your branch, CloudCannon will sync that change to all CloudCannon Sites connected to that branch by overwriting the version of your file on your Site with the version from your Git repository. This behavior keeps your CloudCannon Site up to date with your Git repository.

Publishing Conflicts can occur when you <a href="/documentation/articles/connect-a-publish-branch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connect a Publish Branch</a> to your Site. A [Publish Branch](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-publish-branch/) is the copy of your Site to which you publish your changes. Connecting a Publish Branch allows you to work on your website using a separate copy without your changes going public until you are ready.

Multiple Sites can contribute to the same Publish Branch. A Publishing Conflict occurs when you or a team member have updated the same file on different branches that contribute to the same Publish Branch. When one Site publishes to the Publish Branch first, the other Site must update. CloudCannon will detect that there are conflicting versions of the same file and ask you to resolve this conflict by choosing which version of the file to keep: the changes on our current Site, the incoming changes from the Publish Branch, or a hybrid of the two.

CloudCannon will notify you about a Publishing Conflict using the *Conflicts* warning notification above the *Publish* button in your *Site Navigation*.

For more information, please read our documentation on <a href="/documentation/articles/resolve-publishing-conflicts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resolving publishing conflicts</a>.

### Example

Let's go through an example of how a Publishing Conflict can occur.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/publishing/what-is-a-publish-branch/2025-03/CloudCannon-Documentation-Branching-Workflow-Diagram.png" alt="A diagram of a branching workflow shows three project branches publish to the Staging Branch, which publishes to the Live Website branch." title="Branching Workflow Diagram" type="photo"/>

In the diagram above, three Sites contribute to the same Publish Branch: one for writing a new blog, one for removing a product page, and one for updating the Site navigation. Deleting the product page and updating the navigation both require our team to make changes to the `/products/` page: one team member removes a link from that page, and another renames the page to `/services/`, effectively deleting the `/products/` page and replacing it with the new `/services/` page. These changes conflict with each other.

The team member updating the website navigation finishes first and publishes their changes to the Publish Branch: "Staging Website."

We are working on removing the product page, and before we can publish it to the staging website, CloudCannon will prompt us to <a href="/documentation/articles/update-from-a-publish-branch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update from our Publish Branch</a>. When we try to update, CloudCannon detects conflicting versions of the `/products/` file: on our Site, we have changed a link, but on the Publish Branch, the `/products/` page doesn't exist anymore.

Before we can publish our changes, CloudCannon requires us to choose which version of the file to keep.
