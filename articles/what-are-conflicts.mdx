In CloudCannon, conflicts arise when multiple people try to update the same file, or part of a file, in a way that conflicts with each other. When CloudCannon detects a conflict, it is important to resolve it by choosing which version of your file to keep.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Conflicts aren't dangerous to your content or website — they're CloudCannon's way of letting you know that there are two versions of your file, and that you need to choose how to proceed.
</comp.Notice>

There are two types of conflicts you can encounter in CloudCannon:

* **Publishing conflict** — When changes to a file on your Site conflict with incoming changes to the same file from your [Publish Branch](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-publish-branch/).
* **Syncing conflict** — When unsaved changes to a file on your Site conflict with incoming changes to the same file from a different CloudCannon Site or your git repository.

CloudCannon will warn you when it detects a conflict using a notification in your *Site Navigation* or on the *Publishing* page.

## Publishing conflicts

Publishing conflicts can occur when you [connect a Publish Branch](/documentation/articles/connect-a-publish-branch/) to your Site. A Publish Branch is the copy of your Site to which you publish your changes. Connecting a Publish Branch allows you to work on your website using a separate copy, without your changes going public until you are ready.

Multiple Sites can contribute to the same Publish Branch. In the diagram below, three Sites contribute to the same Publish Branch. If our team member

A publishing conflict occurs when you or a team member have updated the same file on different branches
