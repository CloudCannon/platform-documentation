<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  As of October 2024, this documentation is only applicable to Sites using Unified Configuration.
  For Sites that have not migrated to Unified Configuration, please read the documentation on our [non-unified documentation website](https://non-unified.cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/define-your-data/).
</comp.Notice>

Defining data allows you to populate [select and multiselect inputs](/documentation/articles/select-and-multiselect-inputs/). Each data set corresponds to a file or folder in your site files.

In the following example configuration there are two data sets:

1. `authors` which is read from the contents of a single file
2. `offices` which is read from the contents of each file in a directory

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
```

data_config:
  authors:
    path: data/authors.csv
  offices:
    path: data/offices

```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

## Options

Your data configuration has the following options available:

<comp.DataReference>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="data_config" type_markdown="Object">
    This key defines which data files or folders are available to populate [Select and Multiselect inputs](/documentation/articles/select-and-multiselect-inputs/).

    This key has no default.

    For more information, please read our documentation on [defining your data](/documentation/articles/define-your-data/).
