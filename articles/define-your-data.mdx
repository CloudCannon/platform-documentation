Defining data allows you to populate [select and multiselect inputs](/documentation/articles/select-and-multiselect-inputs/). Each data set corresponds to a file or folder in your site files.

In the following example configuration there are two data sets:

  1. `authors` which is read from the contents of a single file
  1. `offices` which is read from the contents of each file in a directory

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
```
data_config:
  authors:
    path: data/authors.csv
  offices:
    path: data/offices
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>
