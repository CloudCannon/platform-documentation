A Custom Domain is a unique address used to identify a website. For example, CloudCannon's domain is [cloudcannon.com](https://cloudcannon.com/). The domain is the part of your URL that users are most likely to remember. You can purchase a Domain Name from a Domain Registrar.

* **Domain Name** — The unique address used to access a website (e.g., [cloudcannon.com](https://cloudcannon.com/)).
* **Domain Registrar** — A third-party company that handles the reservation of domain names and assigns IP addresses to domain names. Most CloudCannon users rent a domain name from a Registrar (e.g., <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/products/registrar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflare Registrar</a>, <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NameCheap</a>).

Owning a Custom Domain for business or personal use is useful to improve brand recognition and search engine optimization.

You don't need to purchase a Custom Domain to create and edit a Site on CloudCannon, as CloudCannon automatically provides a free [Testing Domain](/documentation/articles/testing-domain/) to all Sites. However, we don't recommend using your Testing Domain as your primary URL for two reasons.

One, you cannot change the automatically generated testing domain name without creating a new Site on CloudCannon. The automatically generated domain may not be right for you or your Site. You can generate a new one by creating a new Site with the same files, however this can be inefficient.

Two, by default CloudCannon automatically de-indexes Testing Domains so that they do not appear in search engines.

### Multiple Subdomains

When there are multiple sites with subdomains on the same domain, a subdomain is delegated as the main domain. All unallocated subdomains redirect to the sites with the main domain. For example:

* A site has **www.example.com** attached
* Another site has **docs.example.com** attached
* **www.example.com** is set as the main domain

Visiting any subdomain other than **www.example.com** or **docs.example.com** [will redirect](/documentation/articles/add-a-wildcard-ssl-certificate/) to **www.example.com**.

To set a site with a subdomain as the main domain:

1. Create at least two sites with the same domain and different subdomains
2. Navigate to the *Domain Settings* / *Redirects*
3. Click Set Main Domain on a site to redirect all unused subdomains there
