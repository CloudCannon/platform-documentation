## What are subdomains?

### Multiple Subdomains

When there are multiple sites with subdomains on the same domain, a subdomain is delegated as the main domain. All unallocated subdomains redirect to the sites with the main domain. For example:

* A site has **www.example.com** attached
* Another site has **docs.example.com** attached
* **www.example.com** is set as the main domain

Visiting any subdomain other than **www.example.com** or **docs.example.com** [will redirect](/documentation/articles/add-a-wildcard-ssl-certificate/) to **www.example.com**.

To set a site with a subdomain as the main domain:

1. Create at least two sites with the same domain and different subdomains
2. Navigate to the *Domain Settings* / *Redirects*
3. Click Set Main Domain on a site to redirect all unused subdomains there
