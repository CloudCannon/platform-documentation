A Custom Domain is a unique address used to identify a website. For example, CloudCannon's domain is [cloudcannon.com](https://cloudcannon.com/). The domain is the part of your URL that users are most likely to remember. You can purchase a Domain Name from a Domain Registrar.

* **Domain Name** — The unique address used to access a website (e.g., [cloudcannon.com](https://cloudcannon.com/)).
* **Domain Registrar** — A third-party company that handles the reservation of domain names and assigns IP addresses to domain names. Most CloudCannon users purhase a domain name from a Registrar (e.g., <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/products/registrar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflare Registrar</a>, <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NameCheap</a>).

You can [add a Custom Domain](/documentation/articles/add-a-custom-domain/) to a Site on CloudCannon. Every time you [save changes](/documentation/articles/save-your-changes/) to your Site's content, CloudCannon will [build your Site](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-site-build/) and serve the new content on your Custom Domain.

## Do I need a Custom Domain?

Owning a Custom Domain for business or personal use is useful to improve brand recognition and search engine optimization.

You don't need to purchase a Custom Domain to create and edit a Site on CloudCannon, as CloudCannon automatically provides a free [Testing Domain](/documentation/articles/testing-domain/) to all Sites. However, we don't recommend using your Testing Domain as your primary URL for two reasons.

One, you cannot change the automatically generated testing domain name without creating a new Site on CloudCannon. The automatically generated domain may not be right for you or your Site. You can generate a new one by creating a new Site with the same files, however this can be inefficient.

Two, by default CloudCannon automatically de-indexes Testing Domains so that they do not appear in search engines.

## Using subdomains and subpaths

You can separate and organize your website content into multiple Sites on CloudCannon and serve that content on a specific subdomain or subpath of your Custom Domain.

* **Base Domain** — The unmodified domain name of a website, including the TLD (e.g., example.com, or cloudcannon.com). Also called a root or apex domain.
* **Subdomain** — An additional name on the front of your URL, prefixing your base domain name (e.g., "docs" in docs.example.com, or "blog" in blog.example.com).
* **Subpath** — An additional name prefixing your page slug and suffixing your base domain name (e.g., "articles" in example.com/articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/, or "staff" in example.com/staff/). Also called a subdirectory.

Separating your content onto different CloudCannon Sites can be helpful to improve clarity for your content editors and users, and enable you to use separate Git repositories for distinct areas of your website.

Let's walk through an example.

We want to separate the content on our website for our team members and users to improve clarity around the layout of information on our website. To do this, we can create two CloudCannon Sites for our team members, and two subdomains for our users.

* Site One: Contains our website's Marketing content, linked to our main domain (e.g., example.com). Linked to our Marketing Git repository, with branded page themes.
* Site Two: Contains our website's Documentation content, linked to a subdomain (e.g., docs.example.com). Linked to our Documentation Git repository, with simpler page themes.

We could also accomplish the same goal by hosting content on the dedicated subpaths (example.com and example.com/docs/). Whether you use subdomains or subpaths is a matter of personal preference.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Having your content on separate Sites means you can specify which content different teams are allowed to edit using [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/).
</comp.Notice>

If you use [CloudCannon DNS](/documentation/articles/configure-cloudcannon-dns/), CloudCannon will redirect all unallocated subdomains to the main domain. For example, if you have one Site connected to example.com, and another Site connected to the subdomain docs.subdomain.com, CloudCannon will redirect anyone trying to access an unallocated subdomain (e.g., app.example.com) or misspelled subdomain name to the main domain, example.com.

For more information, please read our documentation on [adding a subdomain](t/documentation/articles/add-a-subdomain/) and [hosting your Site on a subpath](/documentation/articles/host-your-site-on-a-subpath/).
