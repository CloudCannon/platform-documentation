To set up bearer tokens for your site:

1. Go to the *Site Settings* / *Bearer Tokens* section
2. Enter a token name and click **Create Bearer Token**

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/hosting-authentication-bearer-tokens.png" alt="Screenshot of bearer tokens interface" type="screenshot" />

Youâ€™ll now need to send through an `Authorization` header to access the site. This is intended for scripts or machine users. For example:

<comp.CodeBlock language="shell" source="shell">
```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" https://example.com/products.json

```
</comp.CodeBlock>
