  <p><strong>Permissions required</strong></p><p>Members of the Owners, Developers, and Technical Editors <a href="/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/">Default Permission Groups</a>, or <a href="/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/">Custom Permission Groups</a> with the <code>site:source-editor:write</code> permission, can add <em>Editable Regions</em> to files using the Source Editor in CloudCannon.</p>
</comp.Notice>

Image *Editable Regions* are one type of [Editable Region](/documentation/articles/what-are-editable-regions/) you can add to your layout and HTML-like files to enable visual editing. Image *Editable Regions* allow you to upload images from your local storage, select existing images from your repository or DAM, and manage image details like title or alt text.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p>To avoid misconfiguration issues where CloudCannon cannot find the data property you want to edit, always add <em>Editable Regions</em> to values closest to the root of the file first (i.e., work from parent elements towards child elements).</p>
</comp.Notice>

These instructions assume you have configured your [build settings](/documentation/articles/configure-your-first-build/) and are comfortable editing HTML layouts, either in CloudCannon's [Source Editor](/documentation/articles/the-source-editor/) or your local development environment.

To configure Image *Editable Regions* in the [Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/the-visual-editor/):

1. Identify the file you want to which you want to add an Image *Editable Region*. We recommend any layout files that contain templating that is populated by content files at build time.
2. Open the file in CloudCannon's Source Editor or your local development environment.
3. Identify the `<img>` HTML tag that contains your templating and add the HTML attribute `data-editable="image"` . If no DOM element is available, you can wrap the templating in the `<editable-image>` web component.
4. Add the `data-prop-src=""` HTML attribute to the same DOM element, or to the `<editable-image>` web component. The value of `data-prop-src` should be the path the to data property you want to edit.
5. Optional. If you store image title or alt text data in your content files, add the `data-prop-title=""` and `data-prop-alt=""` HTML attributes to the same DOM element, or to the `<editable-image>` web component. The value of these attributes should be the path the to data property you want to edit.
6. Save the change to your *Site*. CloudCannon will automatically rebuild your *Site*.

When you open the file in the Visual Editor, CloudCannon will show yellow *Editable Region* boxes around the image. CloudCannon will show a data panel for selecting your image when you click into the *Editable Region*.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  <p><strong>Want to make a standalone HTML-like file visually editable?</strong></p><p>We recommend configuring <a href="/documentation/articles/configure-source-editable-regions/">Source Editable Regions</a> for standalone HTML-like files (i.e., files that contain HTML structure and templating, like <code>.astro</code> or <code>.liquid</code>) rather than several Image and Text <em>Editable Regions</em>.</p>
</comp.Notice>

## Examples

Here are a few examples of different Image *Editable Regions*:

<comp.CodeBlock language="Astro" source="BlogPost.astro">
``````````

<div class="hero-image">
    {heroImage &&
      <img
        data-editable="image" /*1*/
        data-prop-src="heroImage" /*2*/
        data-prop-alt="heroImageAlt" /*3*/
        data-prop-title="heroImageTitle" /*4*/
        width={1020}
        height={510}
        src={heroImage}
        title={heroImageTitle}
        alt={heroImageAlt}
      />
    }
</div>

``````````
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  The `data-editable` attribute defines what kind of data this element contains. In this case, the value is `image`.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="2">
  The `data-prop-src` attribute passes the value of `heroImage` to the Image Editable Region with the `src` key.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="3">
  The `data-prop-title` attribute passes the value of `heroImageTitle` to the Image Editable Region with the `title` key.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="4">
  The `data-prop-alt` attribute passes the value of `heroImageAlt` to the Image Editable Region with the `alt` key.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>

## Expected data property format

Image *Editable Regions* expect the data defined by `data-prop` to be in the `key: string` format. By using the `data-prop-*` attribute, we can append a key to the value passed to the Image *Editable Region*.

For example, `data-prop="theme_color"` pointing at the front matter object `theme_color: red` would pass the value "red" to the *Editable Region* in the Visual Editor. If we use `data-prop-color="theme_color"` instead, we can pass "color: red" to the *Editable Region*.

## Misconfigured Image *Editable Regions*

CloudCannon will display an orange warning box in the Visual Editor if your Image *Editable Regions* is misconfigured.

Image *Editable Regions* are misconfigured if:

* You did not define the `data-prop` HTML attribute.
* The *Editable Region* has an invalid data type (e.g., your Text region has a number or object, instead of a string).
* There is no `<img>` child element in the Image *Editable Region* web component.
* Upload failures
