Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity. You might want to authenticate a user's identity if you only want specific people to view your website's content or the content of a subset of pages. For example, if your Site is for internal company use only, you may want users to log in before they can see your website's content. Or, if your Site has a "Member's Only" section but still maintains public pages, you can authenticate a user's identity to access that section.

CloudCannon supports three authentication methods: [password authentication](/documentation/articles/enable-password-authentication/), [user account authentication](/documentation/articles/enable-user-account-authentication/), and [SAML authentication](/documentation/articles/enable-saml-authentication/).

**If you host your Site on CloudCannon, you can require visitors to authenticate their identity before they can access some or all of your content. CloudCannon supports password, user account, and SAML authentication methods and can generate bearer tokens for machine users.**
