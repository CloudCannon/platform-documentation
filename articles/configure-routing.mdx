<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Custom Routing is only available for Sites hosted through CloudCannon. If you host your Site externally, or use CloudCannon in [Headless Mode](/documentation/articles/what-is-headless-mode/), Custom Routing will not work.
</comp.Notice>

Configure your CloudCannon's hosting by configuring a single JSON file. Create a `routing.json` file in the `.cloudcannon` folder at the root of your file structure. When URLs are loaded through the file server, this file is loaded to extend the default behaviour. Add [custom headers](#custom-headers) and [configure redirects](#redirects) all in one place.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Producing invalid JSON in this file will break the build and prevent hosting being impacted. Error messages will be available in the build output.
</comp.Notice>

### Routes

Routes are useful in two cases:

1. **Redirects**: When you change your websiteâ€™s structure, you should redirect the old URLs to the new pages. This ensures external links pointing to the old content and search engines can be redirected.
2. **Push state routing**: Certain SSGs output a single html file that is expected to load on multiple routes. JavaScript on that page will load different content based on the url.

Configure your `routing.json` to include an array under the `routes` key with the following keys:

<comp.DataReference>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="from" type_markdown="Regex (Implemented using [re2](https://github.com/uhop/node-re2))">
    A regular expression or plain string defining the url to match. The urls will always start with a / character. Implicit ^ and $ on each value.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="to" type_markdown="String">
    The new URL to replace the current path including [regex parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace#specifying_a_string_as_a_parameter).
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="status" type_markdown="Number">
    One of 200, 301, 302, 307, 308, 404, or 410. Used to define the [HTTP status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) to use on the route.

    301, 302, 307 and 308 codes trigger a redirect to a new location resulting in two requests.

    200, 404, and 410 change the URL that is served resulting in a single request. When using these statuses, the "to" field must refer to a path on the same site, with the domain and protocol excluded.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="forced" type_markdown="Boolean">
    If forced is true (default), the redirect will take priority. If forced is false, the redirect will only run if no file exists on that route. This is useful if you have a greedy regex that you don't want interfering with existing routes.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="substitutions" type_markdown="Boolean">
    If substitutions is true (default), the `to` option can use regex parameters. If substitutions is false, the `to` option will be used as is. This is useful if you have a URL with characters that resemble the regex parameters.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
</comp.DataReference>

<comp.CodeBlock language="json" source=".cloudcannon/routing.json">
```

{
  "routes": [
    {
      "from": "/documentation/(.*)",
      "to": "/docs/$1",
      "status": 308
    },
    {
      "from": "/cloudcannon/(.*)",
      "status": 302,
      "to": "https://cloudcannon.com/$1"
    },
    {
      "from": "/app/(.*)",
      "status": 200,
      "to": "/app/"
    }
  ]
}

```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Redirects will only occur if the `from` url doesn't resolve to a file. Rules are read in order and the earliest matching rule is used.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  You can redirect to, but not from a URL fragment (e.g. \#example-heading). The fragment is not passed to the server so, it cannot be processed by the redirect.
</comp.Notice>

### Custom Headers

Configure extra headers on any route. Meet security needs or change some behaviour. Configure your `routing.json` to include an array under the `headers` key with the following keys:

<comp.DataReference>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="match" type_markdown="Regex (Implemented using [re2](https://github.com/uhop/node-re2))">
    A regular expression or plain string defining the url to match. The urls will always start with a / character. Implicit ^ and $ on each value.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="headers" type_markdown="Array">
    A list of header names and values to add to the matching request
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="headers.name" type_markdown="String">
    The name of the header to configure. Allowed values are

    * 'strict-transport-security'

    * 'x-robots-tag'

    * 'x-content-type-options'

    * 'x-frame-options'

    * 'x-xss-protection'

    * 'access-control-allow-origin'

    * 'access-control-allow-headers'

    * 'access-control-allow-methods'

    * 'content-security-policy'

    * 'content-security-policy-report-only'

    * 'expect-ct'

    * 'sourcemap'

    * 'large-allocation'

    * 'content-type'

    * 'referrer-policy'

    * 'permissions-policy'
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="headers.value" type_markdown="String">
    The value to return in the header
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
</comp.DataReference>

<comp.CodeBlock language="json" source=".cloudcannon/routing.json">
```

{
  "headers": [
    {
      "match": "/about/",
      "headers": [
        {
          "name": "Access-Control-Allow-Origin",
          "value": "example.com"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Headers are processed at the beginning of all calls. Rules are read in order and combined on all matching rules similar to how CSS works.

### Generated redirects

Create dynamic redirects from pages and data of your site.

During your build process, generate a file on `_cloudcannon/routing.json` and this will be used instead of `.cloudcannon/routing.json` from your source.
