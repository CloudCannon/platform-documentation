We realize credit cards sometimes decline for unknown reasons, so we try to give you plenty of time to try a new payment method. After a failed payment, we retry the payment four times over the next three weeks. If weâ€™re still unsuccessful during this period, we will cancel your CloudCannon subscription and downgrade your account to our free plan.

If you need more leeway than this, please reach out to [support](https://cloudcannon.com/contact/) and tell us about your situation.
