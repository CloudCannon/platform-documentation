## What are Custom Permission Groups?

Custom Permission Groups give you fine-grained control over the permissions in your Organizations.

Using Custom Permission Groups, you can:

* Select which resources are available to each Group and define what actions are allowed (Read, Write, or Create).
* Alter the scope of a permission from Global to Project, Site, Group, or Base Domain.
* Define exceptions for each Group for more precise permissions.

The maximum number of Custom Permission Groups you can create will depend on your [pricing plan](/pricing/). For more information on Permission Groups in general, please read our documentation on [Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-permission-groups/).

### Selecting resources

Custom Permission Groups use the same list of resources as default Groups. A resource is something you can interact with in CloudCannon, such as a Site, Pull Requests, Settings, or Billing. Each resource has one or more associated actions: Read, Write, or Create.

When you create a Custom Permission Group, you must select which resources you want to add and what actions you want to allow for each resource. Adding a resource to your Custom Permission Group will allow all members of that Group to interact with that resource.

<comp.DocsImage path="" alt="" title=""/>

CloudCannon uses a tree structure to define resources. When you select a resource for your Custom Permission Group, you can choose a broad resource heading (e.g., `site:write`), or drill down to more specific resources (e.g., `site:settings:site-mounting:write` or `site:publish:pull-requests:merge:write`). Adding more specific resources allows your Permission Groups to be as fine-grained as you require.

Let’s walk through an example.

We want to create a Permission Group where members cannot see any existing Sites in the Organization but can add new Sites, which they can then see and edit. This type of Permission Group might work well to keep teams within your Organization from accessing each other’s content. In this case, we should add the resource `site:create` but not `site:read` to our Permission Group.

For more information, including a complete list of resources available, please read our reference documentation on [permissions](/documentation/articles/permissions-reference/).

### Permission scope

The scope of a permission defines how broadly it is applied. Permissions in the [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/) have a Global scope. Permission Groups for [Site Sharing](/documentation/articles/share-a-site-with-site-sharing/) or [Client Sharing](/documentation/articles/share-a-site-with-client-sharing/) have a Site scope.

With Custom Permission Groups, you can set a permission at one of five scopes: Global, Project, Site, Group, and Base Domain.

* Global — This scope encompasses your entire Organization (e.g., the resource `project:create` with the scope Global will allow all members of the Permission Group to create new Projects in your Organization, which they then have permission to edit).
* Project — This scope encompasses a specific Project (e.g., the resource `site:publish:pull-request:open:write` with a Project scope will allow all members of the Permission Group to create Pull Requests for any site within the Project, but not merge them).
* Site — This scope encompasses a specific Site (e.g., the resource `site:analytics:read` with a Site scope will allow all members of the Permission Group to view the hosting and building analytics for a single Site).
* Group — This scope encompasses a specific Group (e.g., the resource `group:member:write` with a Group scope will allow all members of the Permission Group to edit the members of a specific Group).
* Base Domain — This scope encompasses a specific Base Domain (e.g., the resource `base-domain:settings:dns:write` with a Domain scope will allow all members of the Permission Group to edit DNS records for a specific domain).

Custom Permission Groups can contain more than one scope. For example, you might want to create a Group that can approve Pull Requests for a specific Project and manage the Domain associated with one Site in that Project. This Permission Group would contain the resources `site:publish:pull-request:merge:write` with a Project scope and `base-domain:write` at the Site scope.

When you select Project, Site, Group, or Base Domain as a scope, CloudCannon will prompt you to select which instance(s) you want the scope to cover (e.g., name the Sites or Permission Groups).

Not all resources work with all scopes. For example, you can’t give someone the resource `project:delete:write` with a Site scope, as Sites cannot contain Projects, or `org:billing:write` with a Group scope, as you control billing at the Organization level. When you create a Custom Permission Group, CloudCannon will filter out the resources that don’t apply to your scope.

### Exceptions

Exceptions allow you to set broad permissions and then remove specific permissions from a Group. For example, a team member might have permission to edit Sites within a Project except for the Production Site.

Exceptions are more efficient than explicitly providing permission for many resources. Let’s walk through an example.

We want to limit a team member from editing the Production site but enable editing for all other Sites within the Project. We could explicitly give permission for all those Sites. However, each time someone adds a new Site to the Project, we would need to update the Permission Group. Using an exception, we can remove permission for a single site and set the scope of the Permission Group as “Project” to allow editing permissions for all future Sites.

## Default vs. Custom Permission Groups

CloudCannon provides [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups) on every pricing plan. The Default Permission Groups (Owner, Developer, Technical Editor, and Editor) are hierarchical, meaning that each Group also contains the permissions of all Groups below it in the hierarchy. Default Permission Groups are convenient if you have fewer team members, less complex sharing requirements, or do not want to configure Custom Permission Groups.

The Default Permission Groups may not be right for you if:

* You want non-hierarchical Permission Groups.
* You want to define a subset of your Sites that team members can access (e.g., a project, all sites except the production Site, or a specific Site).
* You want to define who can perform specific actions (e.g., making vs approving pull requests, reading vs editing content, branching, inbox management).
* You want to define which files within a Site a team member can edit (e.g., a collection, specific file types, or a single file).
* You want to limit which other Organization members a team member can see (e.g., only members they share a Permission Group with).
* You want to prevent a team member from accessing existing Sites but allow them to create new Sites in your Organization, which they can edit.

Because Default Permission Groups have a Global scope, CloudCannon will give Group members the same permissions for every Site in your Organization. Additionally, you cannot edit the permissions granted by Default Permission Groups.

You can overcome these limitations by creating Custom Permission Groups.

## Custom Permission Groups vs. Site Sharing

Using Default Permission Groups, you cannot limit access to an individual Site. You can address this problem using [Site Sharing](/documentation/articles/sharing-on-a-per-site-basis/) or using Custom Permission Groups.

Site Sharing allows you to invite a team member to view, edit, and publish content for a specific Site. Each Site has two permission groups for Site Sharing, identical to the Technical Editor and Editor Default Permission Groups except with a Site scope.

Custom Permission Groups do everything Site Sharing does and more. For [Team and Enterprise customers](/pricing/), we recommend using Custom Permission Groups rather than Site Sharing for finer control over your content.
