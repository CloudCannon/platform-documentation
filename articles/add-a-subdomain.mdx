A [subdomain](/documentation/articles/add-a-subdomain/) is an additional name on the front of your URL. Subdomains help you to separate and organize content on your Site.

To connect a subdomain, you must have access to the main domain name.

To add a custom subdomain to a Site in CloudCannon:

1. Open the Site to which you want to add the subdomain.
2. Navigate to the *Custom Domain* page under *Site Settings*.
3. Select the *Add new custom domain* option in the *Choose your hosting option* dropdown.
4. In the *Domain Name* text field, enter the subdomain, domain, and tld of you want to connect to this Site (e.g., support.example.com).
5. Click the *Add Domain* button.

CloudCannon will connect your subdomain to your Site.

Subdomains do not get a dedicated Card in the *Domains browser*. Instead, your Site will appear in the list of Sites using the main domain name (i.e., the Site connected to support.example.com will appear in the list of Sites connected to example.com).
