A [subdomain](/documentation/articles/add-a-subdomain/) is an additional name on the front of your URL. Subdomains help you to separate and organize content on your Site.

To connect a subdomain, you must have access to the main domain name.

To add a custom subdomain to a Site in CloudCannon:

1. Open the Site to which you want to add the subdomain.
2. Navigate to the *Custom Domain* page under *Site Settings*.
3. Select the *Add new custom domain* option in the *Choose your hosting option* dropdown.
4. In the *Domain Name* text field, enter the subdomain, domain, and TLD of the Site you want to connect to (e.g., support.example.com).
5. Click the *Add Domain* button.

CloudCannon will connect your subdomain to your Site.

Subdomains do not get a dedicated Card in the *Domains browser*. Instead, your Site will appear in the list of Sites using the main domain name (i.e., the Site connected to support.example.com will appear in the list of Sites connected to example.com).

To stop hosting your Site on a subdomain, navigate to the *Danger Zone* tab on the *Custom Domain* page and click the *Remove Custom Domain* button.

## Host your Site on a subdomain

If you want your main domain to be a subdomain, you need to redirect your base domain name to the subdomain.

To set a subdomain as your main domain:

1. Create two Sites, one with your main domain and one with a subdomain.
2. Navigate to the *Domain browser* from your *Org Navigation* or *Organization Dashboard*.
3. Click the Card for the domain you want to configure.
4. Open the *Domain Settings* tab and navigate to the *Redirects* section.
5. Click the *Set Main Domain* button on the Site you want CloudCannon to treat as your main domain.

CloudCannon will redirect all unused subdomains (including the base domain) to your main domain.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  If you have configured your [DNS](/documentation/articles/what-is-dns/) to point a specific domain at a service outside of CloudCannon, CloudCannon will not be able to redirect that domain to your main domain.
