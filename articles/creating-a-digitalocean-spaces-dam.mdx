[DigitalOcean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces) is a scalable, performant data storage service, built of top of Amazon's S3 service.

Below is a step-by-step guide for getting set up with DigitalOcean Spaces and connecting it to CloudCannon.

### Create your Spaces bucket

[Sign in to your DigitalOcean account](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/), and navigate to "Spaces" using the sidebar.

Click the "Create Spaces Bucket" button. Choose a datacenter region close to your users and enter a unique name for your bucket. Finally, click "Create a Spaces Bucket" to finish.

### Make your bucket items public

# TODO

### Configure CORS policies

You will need to configure your CORS policies to allow CloudCannon to interact with your bucket. In the Settings tab for your bucket in DigitalOcean, click the Add button next to "CORS Configurations" to add a new policy.

Minimally, you need to allow the GET and PUT methods, and the Content-Type header for https://app.cloudcannon.com.

### Create an API token

You will also need to create an API token to allow CloudCannon to access your bucket. Click on "API" in the sidebar in DigitalOcean, and open the "Spaces Keys" tab.

Click "Generate New Key" and type any name to create the key. Save the secret token somewhere safe, and note down the Key for later.

### Connect your DAM to CloudCannon

You should now have everything you need to connect CloudCannon with your R2 DAM.

Navigate to the Assets section of your Organization settings, and use the menu to authenticate a new Cloudflare R2 DAM.
