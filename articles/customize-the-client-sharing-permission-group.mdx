<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  This feature is available to customers on our [Team and Enterprise plans](/pricing/). Want to chat about whether this feature is right for you? Our support team is always <a href="mailto:success@cloudcannon.com?subject=A%20question%20about%20custom%20Permission%20Groups" rel="noreferrer">happy to hear from you</a>.
</comp.Notice>

Each Site has one [Permission Group](/documentation/articles/what-are-permission-groups/) for Clients with a Site scope. Anyone who logs into your Site using the Client Sharing password is considered a member of this Permission Group. [Team and Enterprise customers](/pricing/) can customize the permissions available to Clients for each Site using [Client Sharing](/documentation/articles/share-a-site-with-client-sharing/).

To customize the permissions in the Client Sharing Permission Group:

1. Navigate to the *Client Sharing* page under *Site settings*.
2. Click on the *Permissions* tab.
3. Select the resources you want to add and what actions you want to allow for each resource (i.e., Read, Write, or Create).
4. Click the *Update permissions* button.

Unlike other [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/), you cannot configure the scope or exceptions for the Client Sharing Permission Groups.

For a complete list of resources and their associated actions, please read our reference documentation on [permissions](/documentation/articles/permissions-reference/).
