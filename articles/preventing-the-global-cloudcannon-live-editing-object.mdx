CloudCannon injects an object onto the window object when viewed in the Visual Editor. This article will show how to turn off this behaviour. This is helpful if you are using another global variable called `CloudCannon`.

To turn this off, we need to capture the `cloudcannon:load` event and call the `disableGlobalInstall` function.

<comp.CodeBlock language="javascript" source={null}>
```
document.addEventListener('cloudcannon:load', function (e) {
  const { CloudCannon } = e.details;
  CloudCannon.disableGlobalInstall();
});
```
</comp.CodeBlock>
