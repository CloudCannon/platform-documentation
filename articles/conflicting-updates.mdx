While editing your site, CloudCannon will detect and block incoming changes that conflict with any unsaved changes you are working on.

* **Incoming changes** — These are changes to your site originating from outside the branch you are working on, such as from a different CloudCannon site or your git repository. All incoming changes are made by a member of your team.
* **Conflicting updates** — When incoming changes affect files with unsaved changes, these are called conflicting updates.

CloudCannon blocks incoming changes to prevent one change from overwriting another. You can choose how to address the conflict when you save your changes.

CloudCannon will alert you to conflicting updates via a warning message in your&nbsp;*Site navigation*&nbsp;and&nbsp;*Review changes*&nbsp;modal.
