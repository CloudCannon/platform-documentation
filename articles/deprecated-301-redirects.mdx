<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  This feature has been deprecated. It is highly recommended you update to use a [Routing file](/documentation/articles/configuring-custom-routing/).
</comp.Notice>

301 redirects are inside the 301.txt file at the root of your built files. Redirects are specified using the following syntax:

`old-url new-url`

Redirect to external domains and wildcard matching with `*`. Hereâ€™s an example file:

<comp.CodeBlock language="plaintext" source="301.txt">
```
/about.html /about/
/category/* /new-category
/should-have-been-elsewhere/ https://example.com
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Redirects will only occur if the redirect-from page/location no longer exists within the site. If the page/location still exists within your site, this will be served instead of performing a redirect.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  You can redirect to, but not from a URL fragment (e.g. \#example-heading). The fragment is not passed to the server so, it cannot be processed by the redirect.
</comp.Notice>

## Migrating to a Routing file
301\.txt redirects still work to ensure backwards compatibility for older sites. Once a `.cloudcannon/routing.json` file has been added 301.txt will be ignored. 301.txt offers a subset of the options available in the Routing file. This feature will not be receiving any further improvements.

Upgrading will give access to the following improvements:

1. Regex redirects and regex parameters in the location
2. Redirects run before all other behaviour allowing easier configuration
3. More redirect status codes
4. Customise headers on existing routes
5. And more coming soon

For the above example, here is the equivalent:

<comp.CodeBlock language="json" source=".cloudcannon/routing.json">
```
{
  "routes": [
      {
        "from": "/about.html",
        "to": "/about/",
        "status": 301,
        "substitutions": false,
        "forced": false
      },
      {
        "from": "/category/*",
        "to": "/new-category",
        "status": 301,
        "substitutions": false,
        "forced": false
      },
      {
        "from": "/should-have-been-elsewhere/",
        "to": "https://example.com",
        "status": 301,
        "substitutions": false,
        "forced": false
      }
  ]
}
```
</comp.CodeBlock>
