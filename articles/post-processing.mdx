<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Post Processing is only run on sites using legacy CloudCannon Forms. If your site isn't using legacy Forms then it will automatically skip the Post Processing step. See here for information on [migrating to the new CloudCannon Forms](/documentation/articles/legacy-forms-migration-guide/).
</comp.Notice>

## Form Encryption
CloudCannon can encrypt your site's [forms](/documentation/articles/creating-a-form-for-your-site-on-cloudcannon/) for added security. To turn on form encryption:

1. Navigate to *Site Settings* / *Post Processing*
2. Click the checkbox labelled **Encrypt Form Details**
3. Click **Update Post Processing Details**

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If you would like to use CloudCannon's [inbox feature](/documentation/articles/reading-form-submissions-in-your-inbox/), this option must be enabled.
