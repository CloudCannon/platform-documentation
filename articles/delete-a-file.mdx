Deleting files in CloudCannon does not occur immediately. Instead, the *Delete* file action will mark the file for deletion and add a *Deleted* [badge](/documentation/articles/edit-your-files/#file-badges) to the file card. CloudCannon will delete marked files the next time you [save your changes](/documentation/articles/save-your-changes/).

This workflow protects your site from unintentional file deletion by providing multiple opportunities to cancel the deletion.

To mark a file or folder for deletion:

1. Navigate to the item you want to delete in your collection or file browser.
2. Open the *Context menu* by clicking the icon in the top right of the file card.
3. Select *Delete item* or *Delete folder*.

CloudCannon will mark your item for deletion and add a *Deleted* badge to the file card.

Alternatively, you can delete a file using the *File menu* in the top left corner of the editing interface.

You can still open files marked for deletion in an editing interface. These files are in read-only mode, and a red *Deleted file banner* will appear at the bottom of the editing interface.

Once you save your changes, CloudCannon will sync to your Git repository and delete your files.

## Delete a file with unsaved changes

You cannot immediately delete a file with unsaved changes or folders that contain files with unsaved changes.

While there are unsaved changes, CloudCannon will disable the *Delete item* option in the *Context menu* and the editing interface *File menu*. To protect your work, CloudCannon requires you to explicitly discard your unsaved changes before you can mark a file for deletion.

To discard unsaved changes:

1. Navigate to the item you want to delete in your collection or file browser.
2. Open the *Context menu* by clicking the icon in the top right of the file card.
3. Select *Discard unsaved changes*.
4. In the *Discard unsaved changes* modal, review the files that will be affected (if you are discarding a folder, this may affect many files).
5. Click *Discard unsaved changes*.

CloudCannon will discard your unsaved changes and enable the *Delete* option in the *Context menu* and *File menu*.

Alternatively, you can discard unsaved changes from the editing interface using the *File menu* in the top left corner.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  *New* files will be destroyed when you discard unsaved changes.
</comp.Notice>

## Restore a deleted file

You can restore files marked for deletion before you [save your site](/documentation/articles/save-your-changes/). Restoring a file does not restore any unsaved changes discarded before marking the file for deletion.

To restore a file:

1. Navigate to the item you want to delete in your collection or file browser.
2. Open the *Context menu* by clicking the icon in the top right of the file card.
3. Select *Restore file*.

CloudCannon will restore your file and remove the *Deleted* [badge](/documentation/articles/edit-your-files/#file-badges).

Alternatively, you can restore a file using the *File menu* in the top left of an editing interface or the *Restore file* button in the *Deleted file banner* at the bottom of an editing interface.
