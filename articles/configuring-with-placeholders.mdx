Some CloudCannon configuration allows you to use **template strings**, which are a mixture of literal text and dynamic placeholders.

Placeholders are defined with `[ ]` and `{ }` brackets, and are replaced with data when the template is read by CloudCannon.

For example, template strings are used for:

* [Defining where new content files are created](/documentation/articles/choosing-where-to-create-new-files/)
* [Defining where new assets are uploaded](/documentation/articles/adjusting-the-uploads-path/)
* [Formatting your commit messages](/documentation/articles/formatting-your-commit-messages/)
<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  See these articles for more specific information about which placeholders are best for these use cases.
</comp.Notice>

### Data placeholders

Data placeholders are populated from front matter or data values in the editor. They are surrounded with `{ }` brackets.

### Filters

Data placeholders support a number of filters. These are placed after a `|` character. Multiple filters can be applied in a sequence.

* `uppercase` transforms text to uppercase
* `lowercase` transforms text to uppercase
* `deburr` converts Latin-1 Supplement and Latin Extended-A letters to basic Latin letters and removes combining diacritical marks.
* `slugify` converts non-alphanumeric characters into hyphens, then collapses sequential hyphens, then removes leading/trailing and hyphens.
* `trim` removes leading and trailing whitespace

The following placeholders can only be applied to dates:

* `year` gets a 4-digit year from a date
* `month` gets a 2-digit month from a date
* `day` gets a 4-digit day from a date
* `time` gets the time from a date, in a 12-hour format (e.g. 12:30pm)
* `timezone` gets the timezone from a date

Some filters can be given parameters for more flexibility. These are placed after a `=` after the filter name.

* `truncate` removes and extra characters beyond a specified number. For example, `{title|truncate=10}` will resolve to the first 10 characters of a message.
* `default` allows you to provide a fallback value, in case the data is empty
* `if` resolves to the data, if the parameter is "truthy"
* `unless` resolves to the data, if the parameter is "falsy"

### Examples

Let's assume the following data is being used:

<comp.CodeBlock language="yaml" source="">
```
timezone: 'Etc/UTC'
date: 2020-01-02
empty_value:
message: "Hello World"
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Here are some examples of how this data could be transformed by different filters:

<comp.CodeBlock language="text" source="">
```
{date|day}-{date|month}-{date|year} {date|time} ({date|timezone})
// 01-02-2020 00:00am (Etc/UTC)

{message|uppercase|truncate=5}
// HELLO

{message|if=message}
// Hello World

{message|unless=empty_value}
// Hello World

{empty_value|default="Nothing here!"}
// Nothing here!
```
</comp.CodeBlock>
