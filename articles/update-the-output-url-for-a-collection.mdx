2. Turn on *Configuration Mode* using the switch on the right of the *Site Header*. Purple *Edit Configuration* buttons will appear in the *Collection Browser*.
3. Click the *Edit Advanced* in the top right of the *Collection Browser*. CloudCannon will open the *Edit Advanced* data panel.
4. Identify the *URL* text field and enter the template string for your output URL.

CloudCannon will automatically rebuild your *Site* and output your files to the updated URL.
