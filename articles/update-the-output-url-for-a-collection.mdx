<comp.Notice info_type="permissions">
  <p><strong>Permissions required</strong></p><p>Members of the Owners, Developers, and Technical Editors <a href="/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/">Default Permission Groups</a>, or <a href="/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/">Custom Permission Groups</a> with the <code>site:source-editor:write</code> permission, can edit the <em>CloudCannon Configuration File</em> using <em>Configuration Mode</em>.</p>
</comp.Notice>

An [output URL](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-output-url/) is the URL CloudCannon outputs your files to during a [Site build](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-site-build/). Each output file will have a unique URL path, made of a subpath (optional) and a slug. An output URL is required for your webpages to be output to your [Testing Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-testing-domain/), or [Custom Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/) if you have one configured, and for the webpage previews used in the [Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-visual-editor/).

These instructions assume you want to build your *Site*, and have already grouped your files into *Collections*.

To update the output URL for a *Collection*:

1. Navigate to the *Collection* for which you want to update the output URL.
2. Turn on *Configuration Mode* using the switch on the right of the *Site Header*. Purple *Edit Configuration* buttons will appear in the *Collection Browser*.
3. Click the *Edit Advanced* in the top right of the *Collection Browser*. CloudCannon will open the *Edit Advanced* data panel.
4. Identify the *URL* text field and enter the template string for your output URL.
5. Save the change to your *Site*.

CloudCannon will automatically rebuild your *Site* and output your files to the updated URL.

## Template string placeholders

You can use placeholders as well as plain text in the template string of your output URL. CloudCannon will populate placeholders at build time. You can use fixed or data placeholders in output URL template strings, and filters to modify the value of data placeholders.allowing you to use structured data from your files in the Collection.

### Fixed placeholders

The following fixed placeholders are available for your output URL template string:

* `[filename]` — Populated by the original filename including the file extension.
* `[slug]` — Populated by the original filename excluding the file extension. If the filename is "index", this will result in an empty string.
* `[relative_path]` — Populated by the original file name including the file extension, relative to the *Collection* path.
* `[relative_base_path]` — Populated by the original file name excluding the file extension, relative to the *Collection* path.
* `[full_slug]` — An alias for the template path `[relative_base_path]/[slug]`.
* `[path]` — Populated by the original file name including the file extension, relative to your *Site* source.
* `[base_path]` — Populated by the original file name excluding the file extension, relative to your *Site* source.
* `[collection]` — Populated by the key for the *Collection* to which the file belongs.
* `[ext]` — Populated by the last file extension in the original file path.

### Data placeholders

You can reference any front matter field from your file in your output URL template string by using the key name in curly brackets (e.g., `{key}`).

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  <p>Because data placeholders use the value of your front matter keys, the output URL will change every time your update the value. Please be aware, as this can lead to 404 errors when visitors attempt to access previous URLs.</p>
</comp.Notice>

You can also apply filters to your data placeholders using the `|` character after your front matter key name and then the name of the filter.

For a complete list of filters are available for data placeholders in your output URL template string, please read our documentation on [template strings](/documentation/articles/configure-your-template-strings/).
