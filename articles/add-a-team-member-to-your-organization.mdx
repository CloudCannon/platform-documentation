CloudCannon will email anyone who does not yet have a CloudCannon account and invite them to create one. While you wait for them to accept the invitation, their name will appear in the list of *Pending members* on the *Members* tab of the *Team* page.

If you need to re-send or cancel an invitation to a pending member, select the *Re-send invite* or *Cancel invite* options from the *Context menu* at the top right of the member card.
