A webpage preview is an image of your live webpage as it appears on the Internet. Whenever you complete a successful [Site build](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-site-build/), CloudCannon will automatically generate a webpage preview for every output file.

CloudCannon uses your webpage previews for on-page editing in the [Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-visual-editor/), allowing you to make editing decisions in context with your live webpage.

Webpage previews are also used as screenshots for each *File Card* in the *Collection Browser* to help you visually identify your files in-app.

## What is an output file?

When you build your *Site*, CloudCannon will run the build command appropriate for your Static Site Generator (SSG). Your SSG will output each of your website files to a unique URL, allowing visitors to access your webpages on the Internet.

Each output URL is made of a subpath (optional) and a slug. The domain section of each URL will be the name of your [Testing Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-testing-domain/), or [Custom Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/) if you have one configured.

Once your SSG has built your *Site*, CloudCannon will generate a webpage preview for each *Collection* by automatically determining the likely output URL for each file.

If CloudCannon did not determine the correct output URL for your *Collection*, you will not be able to edit your files using the Visual Editor or see screenshots in your *Collection Browser*. You can fix this issue and [generate webpage previews for a Collection](/documentation/articles/generate-webpage-previews-for-a-collection/) by updating the output URL to the correct format.

If you don't want CloudCannon to generate webpage previews for a *Collection*, or if CloudCannon has incorrectly determined an output URL for a non-output *Collection*, you can [disable webpage previews for a Collection](/documentation/articles/disable-webpage-previews-for-a-collection/).
