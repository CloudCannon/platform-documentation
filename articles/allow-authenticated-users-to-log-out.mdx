<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  This feature is only available for Sites [hosted through CloudCannon](/documentation/articles/what-is-web-hosting/#hosting-on-cloud-cannon). If you host your Site externally, or use CloudCannon in [Headless Mode](/documentation/articles/what-is-headless-mode/), this feature will not work.
</comp.Notice>

When you [enable password authentication](/documentation/articles/enable-password-authentication/), [enable user account authentication](/documentation/articles/enable-user-account-authentication/), or [enable SAML authentication](/documentation/articles/enable-saml-authentication/), CloudCannon attaches a cookie to the visitor's web browser when they have successfully logged in (i.e., authenticated). CloudCannon uses this cookie to allow access when a user requests an authenticated route.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  No sensitive authentication data is exposed through cookies.
</comp.Notice>

This cookie is removed if a visitor clears their Internet browser cache.

You can allow authenticated users to log out by adding a logout link to your authenticated routes. CloudCannon reserves the `/logout` route on all Sites. The logout URL for your Site will be your domain name followed by `/logout`, even if you serve your Site on a [subdomain](/documentation/articles/add-a-subdomain/), or [subpath](/documentation/articles/add-a-custom-domain-to-your-site/#use-a-subpath), CloudCannon w (e.g., `example.com/logout`, `app.example.com/logout`, or `example.com/documentation/logout`).

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  CloudCannon reserves the `/logout` URL for all Sites hosted on CloudCannon, even if you do not have a CloudCannon authentication method enabled. You cannot serve any content on this URL.
</comp.Notice>

When a visitor clicks the logout link, CloudCannon removes the cookie and redirects them to your home page.

You can create a logout button on your authenticated pages using the following link:

<comp.CodeBlock language="html" source="index.html">
```

<a href="/logout">Log out</a>

```
</comp.CodeBlock>

If you use [authenticated routes](/documentation/articles/configure-authenticated-routes/), your public pages may have a mix of authenticated and non-authenticated users. In this case, you can use JavaScript and CSS to show the logout button only to authenticated users.

<comp.CodeBlock language="javascript" source="script.js">
```

var isAuthenticated = document.cookie.indexOf("authenticated=true") >= 0;

if (isAuthenticated) {
  document.body.classList.add("authenticated");
}

```
</comp.CodeBlock>

<comp.CodeBlock language="css" source="styles.css">
```

.logout {
  display: none;
}

.authenticated .logout {
  display: block;
}

```
</comp.CodeBlock>

<comp.CodeBlock language="html" source="index.html">
```

<a href="/logout" class="logout">Log out</a>

```
</comp.CodeBlock>

In the above example, the user's browser will add the `authenticated` class to the `body` element of your page if they have the `authenticated` cookie. The CSS file will only display elements with the `.logout` class if nested within an element with the `.authenticated` class.
