Object inputs represent object data within the Data Editor. They are ideal for grouping related inputs, or hiding complicated or infrequently edited data.

By default, they appear as a button that opens a new level in the editor to the side, showing the inputs inside the object. This continues as you click into nested object inputs. Each object level has a back button to return to the parent scope.

Alternatively, object inputs can be configured to behave differently:

1. **Structured** object, a switchable button that can be set from one or more values. Configured with the `structures` option.
2. **Mutable** object, a list showing each entry. Each entry is shown as its own input, including nested objects. Configured with the `subtype` option.

## Examples

Here are a number of examples demonstrating how to use and configure object inputs.

### Object

Object inputs are shown for inputs configured with the type `object`, or for object data values.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json", "toml"]} source="Value convention">
```

  description: These are all the ways to contact us.
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json", "toml"]} source="Input configuration">
```
seo:
  title: How to contact us
  image: /images/staff.png
  description: These are all the ways to contact us.
_inputs:
  seo:
    type: object
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

In the Data Editor, this example appears as a button with a preview of the data inside:

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/object-link.png" alt="Screenshot of unopened object input field" type="screenshot-snippet"/>

Clicking that button opens a new level in the editor showing the inputs for the entries inside the object:

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/object-open.png" alt="Screenshot of active Object input field" type="screenshot-snippet"/>

### Object with configured preview

An object input with configuration to adjust which data is used to generate the preview on the button.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json"]} source="Input configuration">
```
seo:
  title: How to contact us
  image: /images/staff.png
  description: These are all the ways to contact us.
_inputs:
  seo:
    type: object
    options:
      preview:
        text:
          - key: description
        subtext:
          - key: title
          - No title
        image: false
        icon: travel_explore
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

### Object with grouped inputs

An object input with configuration to group related inputs together, creating a more focused editing experience.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json"]} source="Input configuration">
```
title: About
description: Everything about us is explained right here.
image: /staff.png
slug: about-us
sitemap: true
components:
call_to_action: contact-us

_inputs:
  $:
    type: object
    options:
      place_groups_below: false
      groups:
        - heading: SEO
          comment: Values for search engines to read
          inputs:
            - title
            - description
            - image
        - heading: Advanced
          collapsed: true
          inputs:
            - slug
            - sitemap
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

### Structured object

An object input with controls to remove the value, and then replace it with one of two predefined values.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json", "toml"]} source="Input configuration">
```
feature_section:
  image: /uploads/cat.png
  caption: Tabby cat jumping off a wooden fence.
_inputs:
  feature_section:
    type: object
    options:
      structures: _structures.gallery
_structures:
  gallery:
    values:
      - label: Image
        icon: image
        value:
          image:
          caption:
      - label: External link
        icon: link
        value:
          url:
          title:
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  `structures` applies to the object, while `entries.structures` applies to the entries of an object.
</comp.Notice>

### Mutable object

An object with entries shown in a list, with controls to add, remove, rename, and reorder.

Adding a new entry clones the value from the previous entry, and prompts you to enter the new key. At least one entry must exist to clone from, otherwise this input is invalid. This input prevents you removing the last entry.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json", "toml"]} source="Input configuration">
```
staff:
  john:
    name: John Doe
    image: /images/john.png
    age: 28
  jane:
    name: Jane Doe
    image: /images/jane.png
    age: 34
_inputs:
  staff:
    type: object
    options:
      subtype: mutable
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  `entries.allowed_keys` can be used in combination with subtypes and `entries.structures` to control both the keys and the values for this object.
</comp.Notice>

### Mutable object with subtype

An object with entries shown in a list, with controls to add, remove, rename, and reorder.

Adding a new entry creates an empty `time` input, and prompts you to enter the new key. This object can have no entries, since the type is configured for the entries. Object subtypes are configured using the `.*` selector.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json", "toml"]} source="Input configuration">
```
timeline:
  start_time: 9:00 am
  lunch_time: 12:00 pm
  snack_time: 3:00 pm
  home_time: 5:00 pm
_inputs:
  timeline:
    type: object
    options:
      subtype: mutable
  timeline.*:
    type: time
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

### Mutable object with set keys

An object with entries shown in a list, with controls to add, remove, rename, and reorder.

The keys available when adding new entries and renaming existing entries are limited to the `entries.allowed_keys` list.
No entries can be added once all `entries.allowed_keys` are in use.
Entries with keys not included in `entries.allowed_keys` can exist, but if removed/renamed, cannot be re-added.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json", "toml"]} source="Input configuration">
```
menu:
  main:
    weight: 1
  footer:
    weight: 5
_inputs:

      entries:
        allowed_keys:
          - main
          - footer
          - sidebar
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

### Mutable object with set values

An object with entries shown in a list, with controls to add, remove, rename, and reorder.

When adding a new entry here, you are given the option of two predefined values: *Image* and *External Link*.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json", "toml"]} source="Input configuration">

</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  `entries.structures` applies to the entries of an object, while `structures` applies to the object.
</comp.Notice>

### Mutable object with set keys and set values specific to keys

An object with entries shown in a list, with controls to add, remove, rename, and reorder.

When adding a new entry here, you are given the option of two predefined values: *Image* and *External Link*.
The keys available when adding new entries and renaming existing entries are limited to the `entries.allowed_keys` list.
No entries can be added once all `entries.allowed_keys` are in use.
Entries with keys not included in `entries.allowed_keys` can exist, but if removed/renamed, cannot be re-added.

## Options

Object inputs have the following options available within `options` inside an `_inputs` entry:

<comp.DataReference>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="subtype" type_markdown="boolean">
    Changes how this is object input is displayed and interacted with. Defaults to `object`.

    If set to `object`, data entries appear as standard inputs, nested one layer deeper.

    If set to `mutable`, data entries within an object input can be added, renamed, removed and reordered. This also changes the appearance of the input, by listing entries as a sequential group with controls for adding, removing, renaming and reordering.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="entries.allowed_keys" type_markdown="array">
    Defines a limited set of keys that can exist on the data within an object input. This set is used when entries are added and renamed with `subtype: mutable`. Defaults to `[]`.

    Has no effect if `subtype` anything but `mutable`. *Only applies to mutable objects*.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="entries.structures" type_markdown="string or object">
    Provides data formats when adding entries to the data within this object input. When adding an entry, team members are prompted to choose from [a number of values you have defined](/documentation/articles/defining-what-adds-to-an-array-with-array-structures/). Has no default.

    Has no effect if `subtype` anything but `mutable`. *Only applies to mutable objects*.

    If set as an object, the structures value is used directly.

    If set as a string, the structures value is fetched from the [configuration cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/). This allows you to define `_structures` elsewhere and reference it from here.

    <comp.Notice info_type="info">
      This looks similar to, and shares same format as `structures`. However, `entries.structures` applies to the entries within the object, and `structures` applies to the object itself.
    </comp.Notice>
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="entries.assigned_structures" type_markdown="object">
    Reduces the set of structure values available for entries with specific keys within a mutable object input. This set is used when entries are added with `subtype: mutable`. Structure values are referred to by their `id`.

    Has no effect if `subtype` anything but `mutable`. *Only applies to mutable objects*.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="entries.comment" type_markdown="text">
    Used to supply help text above the key input when adding/renaming within a mutable object input. Has no default. Supports a limited set of Markdown: links, bold, italic, subscript, superscript and inline code elements are allowed.

    Has no effect if `subtype` anything but `mutable`. *Only applies to mutable objects*.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="entries.documentation" type_markdown="object">
    Provides a custom link for documentation for editors shown above the key input when adding/renaming within a mutable object input. Contains the following fields:

    * `url` for the `href` value of the link (String, *required*).
    * `text` for the visible text used in the link (String). Defaults to `Documentation`.
    * `icon` for the icon displayed next to the link. Must be a Material Icon name. Defaults to `auto_stories`.

    ```yaml
    _inputs:
      my_object:
        type: object
        options:
          subtype: mutable
          entries:
            documentation:
              url: 'https://example.com/documentation/'
              text: Read more about adding/renaming this key
    ```

    Has no effect if `subtype` anything but `mutable`. *Only applies to mutable objects*.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="empty_type" type_markdown="string">
    Set how an empty value will be saved. Does not apply to existing empty values. Can be one of the following:

    * `object` - an empty value for this input will be stored as `{}` (default).
    * `null` - an empty value for this input will be stored as a null value. This does not apply to TOML files.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="allow_label_formatting" type_markdown="boolean">
    Controls whether or not labels on mutable object entries are formatted. Defaults to `false`.

    *Only applies to mutable objects*.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="groups" type_markdown="array of Group">
    Allows you to group the inputs inside this object together without changing the data structure.

    Groups are labelled with a heading and description. They can start collapsed or expanded (default). The inputs that belong to each group are referred to by key. Groups can only contain inputs inside this object.

    Ungrouped inputs are displayed after the groups by default, but you can reverse this with `place_groups_below`.

    *Does not apply to mutable or structured objects*.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="groups[*].heading" type_markdown="text">
    The main text displayed at the top of a group. Visible when open or collapsed.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="groups[*].description" type_markdown="text">
    The supporting text displayed at the top of a group, below the heading. Visible when open or expanded.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="groups[*].collapsed" type_markdown="boolean">
    Whether the group starts open or collapsed. Defaults to `false` (open).
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="groups[*].inputs" type_markdown="array of string">
    The input keys included in this group. These keys must reference keys within this object input's data. Defaults to `[]`.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="place_groups_below" type_markdown="boolean">
    Controls which order input groups and ungrouped inputs appear in. Defaults to `false`. Inputs are grouped with the `groups` options.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="preview" type_markdown="object">
    The preview definition for changing the way data within an object input is previewed before being expanded. The options available for object inputs are:

    * `text`
    * `subtext`
    * `icon`
    * `image`

    See the [preview options documentation](/documentation/articles/changing-how-cards-preview-your-data/) for detailed information on setting this option.

    If the input has `structures`, the `preview` from the structure definition is used instead.

    <comp.Notice info_type="info">
      Object inputs now support the new `preview` option. [Read our migration guide](/documentation/articles/migrating-to-preview-options/) if you are still using the old options: `text_key`, `subtext_key`, `image_key` and `icon`.
    </comp.Notice>
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="preview.icon" type_markdown="array, string or boolean">
    Controls the icon shown on the unopened input. Must match a [Material Icon](https://material.io/tools/icons/) name. Defaults checking the `icon` key, then falls back to `notes`.

    If set to `false`, no icon is displayed.

    If `image` is set, it will cover `icon` when loaded successfully.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="preview.image" type_markdown="array, string or boolean">
    Controls the image shown on the unopened input. Has no default, falls back to `thumbnail_image`, `thumbnail_image_path`, `image`, and `image_path` in that order.

    If set to `false`, no image is displayed.

    If no image is found, `icon` is displayed instead.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="preview.text" type_markdown="array, string or boolean">
    Controls the main text shown on the unopened input. Has no default, falls back to the first value found (prioritizing text-based values).

    If set to `false`, no text is displayed.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="preview.subtext" type_markdown="array, string or boolean">
    Controls the supporting text shown on the unopened input. Has no default, falls back to listing the `label` of each input inside the object value.

    If set to `false`, no text is displayed.

    Subtext is hidden if text and subtext is the same. If there's no text, subtext is used instead.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="structures" type_markdown="string or object">
    Provides data formats for value of this object. When choosing an item, team members are prompted to choose from [a number of values you have defined](/documentation/articles/defining-what-adds-to-an-array-with-array-structures/). Has no default.

    If set as an object, the structures value is used directly.

    If set as a string, the structures value is fetched from the [configuration cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/). This allows you to define `_structures` elsewhere and reference it from here.

    <comp.Notice info_type="info">
