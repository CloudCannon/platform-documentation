A TesA Testing Domain is a free *.cloudvent.net* URL that CloudCannon assigns to every Site. You can see your Testing Domain any time after your first successful [Site build](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-site-build/).

You can view your Testing Domain by clicking on the *Live Site Preview* button the header of your [Site Navigation](/documentation/articles/configure-your-site-navigation/). This button will take you to the home page of your Site on your Testing Domain.

You can also view specific pages on your Testing Domain. When a file has an output URL, you can view that file on your Testing Domain using the *Preview live site here* in the file *Context Menu*.

You can find the file *Context Menu* in the top right of each file card in your *Collection browser*, or in the top right of any editing interface.
