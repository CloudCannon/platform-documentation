<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  This feature is currently in early access for some customers on our [Team and Enterprise plans](/pricing/). Want to chat about whether this feature is right for you? Our support team is always [happy to hear from you]().
</comp.Notice>

To create a custom [Permission Group](/documentation/articles/what-are-permission-groups/) in your [Organization](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-organization/):

1. Navigate to the *Team* page under *Org settings*.
2. Click on the *Groups* tab.
3. Under the *Groups* tab, click on the *\+ Add group* button in the top right to open the *Create a group* modal.
4. Enter the name of the custom Permission Group.
5. Select whether this permission is an <a href="https://real-violin.cloudvent.net/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/#exceptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exception</a>.
6. Select the scope for this permission. If you select Project, Site, Group, or Base Domain, you must also choose the target to that scope. Selecting a scope will automatically filter the resource tree.
7. Select the resources you want to add and what actions you want to allow for each resource (i.e., Read, Write, or Create).
8. Click the *Add permission* button.
9. Once you are happy with the list of permissions in your Permission Group, click the *Create group* button.

CloudCannon will add the new Permission Group to the *Groups* tab on the *Team* page. You are now able to [add team members to your custom permission group](/documentation/articles/add-a-team-member-to-a-permission-group/).

For more information, including a list of all available permissions, read our reference documentation on [permissions](/documentation/articles/permissions-reference/).
