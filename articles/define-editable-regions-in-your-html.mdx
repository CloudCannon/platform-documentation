Editable Regions enable you to visually edit content in your source HTML in place on your output HTML.

Editable Regions are HTML elements that you define as editable. Define broad sections to provide flexibility, or define separate regions to retain fine control over images and text elements. Editable Regions display yellow borders in the [Visual Editor](/documentation/edit/interfaces/visual-editor/)&nbsp;to indicate areas that can be updated.

Depending on the element an editable is applied to, editors see different options in the editor. There are four types available for editing content in place:

* Inline regions for editing plain text
* Image regions for editing image elements
* Block regions for editing rich text
* Content for editing rich text populated from file content sections

To define an Editable Region:

1. Identify the HTML element you want to be editable
2. Add `class="editable"` to the HTML element, or append `editable` to `class` if the attribute is already defined

  JavaScript is supported in the [Visual Editor](/documentation/edit/interfaces/visual-editor/). However, HTML rendered with JavaScript on page load is not editable.
