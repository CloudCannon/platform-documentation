Editable Regions enable you to visually edit content in your source HTML in place on your output HTML.

Editable Regions are HTML elements that you define as editable. Define broad sections to provide flexibility, or define separate regions to retain fine control over images and text elements. Editable Regions display yellow borders in the [Visual Editor](/documentation/edit/interfaces/visual-editor/)&nbsp;to indicate areas that can be updated.

Depending on the element an editable is applied to, editors see different options in the editor. There are four types available for editing content in place:

* Inline regions for editing plain text
* Image regions for editing image elements
* Block regions for editing rich text
* Content for editing rich text populated from file content sections

To define an Editable Region:

1. Identify the HTML element you want to be editable
2. Add `class="editable"` to the HTML element, or append `editable` to `class` if the attribute is already defined

  JavaScript is supported in the [Visual Editor](/documentation/edit/interfaces/visual-editor/). However, HTML rendered with JavaScript on page load is not editable.

## Best practices for Editable Regions

Not all HTML elements can be edited safely in the Visual Editor. It’s important to think carefully about what you want to be edited, and add the "editable" class only to those elements.

Improperly applied Editable Regions allow team members to break the layout of your site, in ways that can only be fixed in the Source Editor. To prevent this, CloudCannon automatically detects problem cases and disables editing.

Here are some examples of common misuses of Editable Regions, why they don’t conform to best practices, and how to refactor them.

### Unsupported elements

```html
<input type="checkbox" class="editable">
```

Some elements are simply not editable in the Visual Editor. It’s unclear what it would mean to edit an `<input>`, and this probably was not the developer’s intention. Only the following HTML elements should be given the editable class:

* Blocks: `div`, `section`, `article`, `aside`, `main`, `footer`, `header`, `nav`
* Block text: `p`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `blockquote`, `li`, `dd`, `dt`
* Inline text: `span`, `small`, `strong`, `em`, `i`, `b`, `sub`, `sup`, `td`, `th`, `cite`
* Image: `img`
* Link: `a`

#### How to fix this

Remove the "editable" class.

If you need this element to be editable, you can configure a Snippet. Depending on your SSG, there are libraries of Snippets available, or you can create custom Snippets.

### Editable regions containing unsupported elements

```html
<form class="editable">
  <input type="email" name="email" id="email" />
  <p>Enter your email</p>
</form>
```

This would create an editable region containing an uneditable element (`input`). If someone on your team backspaces too many times in this Editable Region, they could delete the `<input>` with no way to restore it.

#### How to fix this

Move the "editable" class directly onto the text you want to edit.

```html
<form>
  <input type="email" name="email" id="email" />
  <p class="editable">Enter your email</p>
</form>
```

### Editable regions containing custom classes

```html
<div class="editable">
  <p class="big">This text is big</p>
  <p class="small">This text is small<p>
</div>
```

If you have used the `styles` configuration option to include the "big" and "small" classes for &lt;p&gt; elements in this Rich Text input, this code will work perfectly!

Otherwise, this poses a problem. If an editor removes all the text in `p.small`, they will have no way to restore it, since there is no way to add arbitrary class names in the editor.

#### How to fix this

One way to fix this would be to add the `styles` configuration to include these class names. [Read more about this option here](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/using-rich-text-inputs-to-edit-your-data/#styles-and-alignment).

<comp.CodeBlock language="YAML" source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
```
_editables:
  block:
    options:
      styles:  paragraph-styles.css
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

<comp.CodeBlock language="CSS" source="paragraph-styles.css">
```
p.big {
  font-size: 2em;
}

p.small {
  font-size: 0.5em;
}
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Another way would be to move the "editable" class down a level, assuming you always want 1 line of each kind of text:

```html
<div>
  <p class="big editable">This text is big</p>
  <p class="small editable">This text is small<p>
</div>
```

### Editable regions containing templating code

```
{% raw %}<div class="editable">
  <h3>Blog posts</h3>
  <ul>
  {% for post in collections.posts %}
    <li>{{ post.title }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</div>{% endraw %}
```

This editable region contains templating code that will be run by an SSG when the site is built. The Visual Editor shows the built output of a page, so this editable region might look like a normal list of blog post titles. However, it would be very destructive to edit this `<div>` since the templating code (invisible on the page) could easily be destroyed.

Using templating code inside an editable region is an anti-pattern and should be avoided in all cases.

#### How to fix

Move the editable region so that it doesn’t contain any templating code. In this example, we can still allow the user to edit the titles of blog posts, by providing in-editor links to the posts themselves. This is much safer, and removes repetition of content from the site.

			Edit this post

	{% endfor %}
	</ul>
</div>{% endraw %}
