To lock builds for your Site:

1. Navigate to the *Build configuration* page under *Site Settings*.
2. Check the *Building Locked* checkbox.
3. Click the *Update Site* button.

Sites can be prevented from building by turning on ‘Building Locked’ within the site settings. This is useful when you want to manage a deployment more manually. Most editing configuration is read at build time, so changes to configuration may be delayed while building is locked.
