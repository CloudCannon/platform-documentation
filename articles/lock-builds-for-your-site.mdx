You can prevent a Site from building by turning on *Building Locked* in the *Site Settings*. Locking builds on your Site is useful if you want to manage deployment manually.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  CloudCannon automatically locks builds if you have not [configured your first build](/documentation/articles/configure-your-first-build/) or selected [Headless Mode](/documentation/articles/what-is-headless-mode/).
</comp.Notice>

To lock builds for your Site:

1. Navigate to the *Build configuration* page under *Site Settings*.
2. Check the *Building Locked* checkbox.
3. Click the *Update Site* button.
