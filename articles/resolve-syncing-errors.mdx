A Syncing error occurs when CloudCannon is unable to update your Site with the incoming changes even after you try to [resume Syncing](/documentation/articles/resume-syncing/) by saving or discarding your changes, because the incoming changes affect the same

If CloudCannon detects a Syncing error, a warning notification will appear

If CloudCannon cannot determine how to merge your unsaved changes with the incoming changes, you will need to speak with a developer on your team to merge these files manually.
