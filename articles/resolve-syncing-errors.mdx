A Syncing error occurs when CloudCannon is unable to update your Site with the incoming changes even after you try to [resume Syncing](/documentation/articles/resume-syncing/) by saving your changes, because the incoming changes conflict with the content you tried to save.

You cannot save unaffected files until you resolve the Syncing error and resume Syncing.

There are three was to resolve a Syncing error:

* Create a new branch and move the changes from your CloudCannon Site to it so that the current branch can sync from your Git provider. You can then attempt to merge the changes in your local development environment.
* Delete all changes on your CloudCannon Site and reset it using the version of your branch on your Git repository.
* Replace all the content on your CloudCannon Site by switching to a different branch. CloudCannon will immediately sync the files from the new branch, and will not delete previously deployed to the current branch.

Alternatively, you can ask your developer to resolve the Syncing error in their local development environment.

These instructions assume that [Syncing is paused](/documentation/articles/why-is-syncing-paused/) on your Site and you have attempted to resume Syncing by saving the changes to affected files.
