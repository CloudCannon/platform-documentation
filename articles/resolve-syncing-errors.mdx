A Syncing error occurs when CloudCannon is unable to update your Site with the incoming changes even after you try to [resume Syncing](/documentation/articles/resume-syncing/) by saving your changes, because the incoming changes conflict with the content you tried to save.

You cannot save unaffected files until you resolve the Syncing error and resume Syncing.

There are three was to resolve a Syncing error:

* Create a new branch and move the changes from your CloudCannon Site to it so that the current branch can sync from your Git provider. You can then attempt to merge the changes in your local development environment.
* Delete all changes on your CloudCannon Site and reset it using the version of your branch on your Git repository.
* Replace all the content on your CloudCannon Site by switching to a different branch. CloudCannon will immediately sync the files from the new branch, and will not delete any content previously deployed to the old branch.

Alternatively, you can ask your developer to resolve the Syncing error in their local development environment.

These instructions assume that [Syncing is paused](/documentation/articles/why-is-syncing-paused/) on your Site and you have attempted to resume Syncing by saving the changes to affected files.

## Create a new branch

To resolve a Syncing error:

1. Navigate to the *Syncing* page, under *Site Settings*.
2. Under the *Syncing Error resolution options* section, click the *Push changes to a new branch* button under the *Create a new branch from CloudCannon changes* heading. CloudCannon will open the *Create a new branch* modal.
3. Enter the name for your new branch in the *New branch name* text field.
4. Click the *Create branch* button.

CloudCannon will immediately push the changes from your CloudCannon Site to the new branch, and sync the files from on your Git repository to the current branch.

## Reset your Site using the Git repository branch

To resolve a Syncing error:

1. Navigate to the *Syncing* page, under *Site Settings*.
2. Under the *Syncing Error resolution options* section, click the *Reset using Git repository* button under the *Reset your Site using the Git repository branch* heading. CloudCannon will open the *Reset using Git repository* modal.
3. Click the *Reset using Git repository* button.

CloudCannon will immediately sync the version of your Site on your Git repository.

## Switch to a different branch

To resolve a Syncing error:

1. Navigate to the *Syncing* page, under *Site Settings*.
2. Under the *Syncing Error resolution options* section, click the *Switch branch* button under the *Switch this Site to a different branch* heading. CloudCannon will open the *Switch branch* modal.
3. Use the *Branch* dropdown to select the branch to which you want to switch this Site.
4. Click the *Switch branch* button.

CloudCannon will immediately sync the files from your chosen branch, without deleting any file previously deployed to the old branch.
