When you create an account on CloudCannon, you can manage your own websites, experiment with a website template, or join someone else's team to manage their content.

If this is your first time creating a CloudCannon account, we highly recommend reading the [Getting Started with Editing](/documentation/guides/getting-started-with-editing/) guide.
