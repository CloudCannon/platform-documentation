[Syncing Conflicts](/documentation/articles/what-are-conflicts/) occurs when you have unsaved changes to a file, and CloudCannon tries to sync an update to that file from your Git repository. To prevent incoming changes from your Git repository from overwriting your unsaved changes, CloudCannon will stop attempting to sync your files and alert you to the Syncing Conflict.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Currently, you cannot use CloudCannon to read incoming changes before you resolve the conflict. Please speak to your developer to determine the incoming changes to your files.
</comp.Notice>

CloudCannon will notify you about a Syncing Conflict using the *Conflicts* warning notification above the *Save* button in your *Site Navigation*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Save-Button-Syncing-Conflict-Notification" alt="A screenshot of the Save Button in the Site Navigation shows a Conflicts warning notification in the top right." title="The Save Button" type="ui-snippet"/>

You will not be able to save any changes to non-conflicted files on your Site until you resolve the Syncing Conflict.

To resolve a Syncing Conflict:

1. Click the *Save* button. CloudCannon will open the *Review changes* modal.
2. Select all affected files. These will be highlighted in orange.
3. Click either the *Save selected* or the *Discard selected* button.

CloudCannon will save or discard your unsaved changes, then proceed with updating your files using the incoming changes.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  When you resolve a Syncing Conflict by saving or discarding conflicted files, you can also select non-conflicted files and apply the same action. However, you cannot select only non-conflicted files. You must resolve all conflicted files before CloudCannon will allow you to save changes to non-conflicted files.

## Resolve syncing errors

In some cases, CloudCannon will be unable to update your Site with the incoming changes even after you try to resolve the Syncing Conflict. This is called a Syncing Error.

Syncing Errors occur when the incoming changes to your Site from

If CloudCannon cannot determine how to merge your unsaved changes with the incoming changes, you will need to speak with a developer on your team to merge these files manually.
