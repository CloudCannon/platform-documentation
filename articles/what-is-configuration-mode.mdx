*Configuration Mode* is a tool for updating the configuration of your *Site*. The *Configuration Mode switch* on the right of your *Site Header* allows you to toggle *Configuration Mode* on and off.

When *Configuration Mode* is on, CloudCannon will display *Edit configuration* buttons next to each element of the app you can configure. These *Edit configuration* buttons are all in purple, making them easy to find and visually distinct from other UI elements.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Configuration-Mode-On" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows several UI elements highlighted in Configuration Mode purple." title="The Collection Browser" type="screenshot"/>

Clicking on one of the *Edit configuration* buttons will open a modal or data panel with fields for configuring the UI element. You will be able to see any visual changes in CloudCannon in real time, and all your changes will be added to your [CloudCannon Configuration File](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-cloudcannon-configuration-file).

When *Configuration Mode* is off, CloudCannon hides all the *Edit configuration* buttons, creating an uncluttered interface for content creators. We recommend spending most of your time with *Configuration Mode* off for a better editing experience, but you can always turn it on to make a quick change your *Site* configuration.
