<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  As of October 2024, this documentation is only applicable to Sites using Unified Configuration.
  For Sites that have not migrated to Unified Configuration, please read the documentation on our [non-unified documentation website](https://non-unified.cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/create-a-global-configuration-file/).
</comp.Notice>

The *CloudCannon Configuration File* is the heart of your CloudCannon experience. As the name implies, the CloudCannon configuration file contains all the configuration for your Site. This includes the appearance and functionality of your [Site Navigation](/documentation/articles/configure-your-site-navigation/), file [Schemas](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-schema/), [Inputs](/documentation/articles/what-are-inputs/), [Structures](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-structure/), and more.

Your configuration file allows you to make CloudCannon your own, customizing your app experience for you and your [team members](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-team-member/).

When you create a new *Site*, and after you sync your files, the in-app guide *Getting Started with Editing* will prompt you to create your *CloudCannon Configuration File*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-No-Config" alt="A screenshot of the Site Dashboard shows the Getting Started in-app guide with a task to create your CloudCannon Configuration File." title="The Site Dashboard" type="screenshot"/>

CloudCannon supports the following configuration file types:

* `cloudcannon.config.json`
* `cloudcannon.config.yaml`
* `cloudcannon.config.yml`

By default, CloudCannon assumes your configuration file is in the root folder of your Git repository, however you can [define a custom configuration file path](/documentation/articles/define-a-custom-configuration-file-path/) if your file is within a nested folder.

CloudCannon preferentially uses configuration from files with a custom configuration path. If you have not defined a custom filepath, then CloudCannon will use the configuration defined in the first file in the root directory, searching in alphabetical order.

You can add content to your *Configuration File* using [Configuration Mode](/documentation/articles/what-is-configuration-mode), or by navigating to your *File Browser* and opening the file in the [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/the-data-editor/) or the [Source Editor](/documentation/articles/the-data-editor/).

## The configuration cascade

The *CloudCannon Configuration File* is the first level in the configuration cascade, which means any configuration defined here will affect all the files on your *Site*. This makes it a great place to configure the default appearance and behavior you want. You can add more specific configuration at other levels of the cascade.

For more information, please read our documentation on the [configuration cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/).

## The source folder

The first key you should define in your CloudCannon configuration file is `source`. This key determines the source folder for your website's files relative to the root of your Git repository. Your [Collections](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-collection/) are configured relative to your source folder. This is useful if you have multiple websites nested in a single repository.
