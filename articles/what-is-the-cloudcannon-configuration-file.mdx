<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  As of October 2024, this documentation is only applicable to Sites using Unified Configuration.
  For Sites that have not migrated to Unified Configuration, please read the documentation on our [non-unified documentation website](https://non-unified.cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/create-a-global-configuration-file/).
</comp.Notice>

The *CloudCannon Configuration File* is the heart of your CloudCannon experience, allowing you to customize the functionality and appearance of your *Site*. Adding formatted content to your *Configuration File* lets you configure your *Site Navigation*, Editing Interfaces, file appearance in the app, how CloudCannon adds new files, and more.

Your *Configuration File* allows you to make CloudCannon your own, customizing your app experience for you and your [team members](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-team-member/).

CloudCannon supports the following configuration file types:

* `cloudcannon.config.json`
* `cloudcannon.config.yaml`
* `cloudcannon.config.yml` (recommended)

After syncing your *Site* files, creating your *CloudCannon Configuration File* should be the first thing you do. CloudCannon will prompt you to [create a configuration file](/documentation/articles/create-your-cloudcannon-configuration-file/) using the *Getting Started* task list on your *Site Dashboard*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Dashboard-Create-Config-File-Task" alt="A screenshot of the Create your CloudCannon Configuration File task from the Getting Started task list shows the Create my Configuration File button." title="The Create a Configuration File task" type="ui-snippet"/>

By default, CloudCannon assumes your *Configuration File* is in the root folder of your Git repository, however you can [define a custom Configuration File path](/documentation/articles/define-a-custom-configuration-file-path/) if your file is within a nested folder.

You can edit your *CloudCannon Configuration File* using *Configuration Mode* or by finding the file in your *File Browser* and opening it in the Source Editor. For more information, please read out documentation on [Configuration Mode](/documentation/articles/what-is-configuration-mode/) in general or the [Source Editor](/documentation/articles/the-data-editor/).

Here's an example of what your *CloudCannon Configuration File* might look like:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
``````````

  uploads: public/uploads

## The configuration cascade

The *CloudCannon Configuration File* is the first level in the *Configuration Cascade*, which means any configuration defined here will affect all the files on your *Site*. This makes it a great place to configure the default appearance and behavior you want. You can add more specific configuration at other levels of the cascade.

For more information, please read our documentation on the [Configuration Cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/).

## The source folder

The first key you should define in your *CloudCannon Configuration File* is `source`. This key determines the *Source Folder* for your website's files relative to the root of your Git repository. Your [Collections](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-collection/) are configured relative to your *Source Folder*. This is useful if you have multiple websites nested in a single repository.
