<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  As of October 2024, this documentation is only applicable to Sites using Unified Configuration.
  For Sites that have not migrated to Unified Configuration, please read the documentation on our [non-unified documentation website](https://non-unified.cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/create-a-global-configuration-file/).
</comp.Notice>

Global configuration files contain your global CloudCannon configuration and top-level values for the [configuration cascade](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/).

Configuration is set in one of the following supported file types. CloudCannon will search the root directory for the first matching file from this list.

* `cloudcannon.config.json`
* `cloudcannon.config.yaml`
* `cloudcannon.config.yml`

This file is stored in the root directory of your repository (i.e. `/cloudcannon.config.*`). Alternatively, you can specify a custom location in the *Editing* section of your site settings.

The [global configuration](/documentation/articles/create-a-global-configuration-file/) file is the heart of your integration with CloudCannon. You can create your configuration file locally or using the CloudCannon configuration GUI. When creating a new site, CloudCannon will guide you through creating a configuration file.
