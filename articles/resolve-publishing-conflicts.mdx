Publishing conflicts when changes to a file on your Site conflict with incoming changes to the same file from your [Publish Branch](https://crawling-ginger.cloudvent.net/documentation/articles/what-is-a-publish-branch/).

CloudCannon will alert you to a publishing conflict

&nbsp;

After CloudCannon has detected a publishing conflict, you will not be able to publish to your Publish Branch or save your files until you resolve the conflict by attempting to merge the affected files, or abandon the attempt.

&nbsp;

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Publishing conflict resolution is available to the Owners, Developers, and Technical Editors [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/) and [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/) with the `site:source-editor:write` and `site:publish:upstream:write` permissions.
</comp.Notice>

These instructions assume that CloudCannon has detected a publishing conflict after you attempted to [update your Site from its Publish Branch](/documentation/articles/update-from-a-publish-branch/).

To merge conflicted files:

1. Navigate to the *Publishing* page by clicking the *Publish* button in your *Site Navigation*.
2. Identify which files have conflicts. These files will have the *conflict* file badge.
3. Click on a conflicted file. CloudCannon will open the *Source Editor* and display the file contents. CloudCannon will highlight the conflicting sections of the file, using green for incoming changes and red for current changes.
4. Select which changes you want to keep by clicking the *Use current* or *Use incoming* buttons to replace one change with another, or clicking into the *Source Editor* to make a hybrid of the changes manually.
5. (Optional.) Click the *Scroll to next conflict* button to move to the next conflict in a file with multiple conflicts.
6. Click the *Mark resolved* button when you have finished resolving all conflicts in a file.
7. Repeat steps 3 - 6 for each conflicted file.
8. Click the *Save all resolved files* button when you have resolved all conflicted files.

CloudCannon will complete the update from your Publish Branch.

&nbsp;

To abandon the attempt to merge conflicted files:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

CloudCannon has detected a publishing conflict after attempting to update this site from its Publish Branch. One or more changes on this Site conflict with incoming changes from your Publish Branch. You must address these conflicts to publish to your Publish branch, or save changes on this Site.

You can review these conflicts in the *Source Editor* by clicking on the file cards below. You can click on the *Use current* or *Use incoming* buttons to replace one change with another, or click into the *Source Editor* to make a hybrid of the changes manually.

If you do not want to resolve your publishing conflicts right now, you can abandon this update attempt.

In some case, CloudCannon cannot resolve a publishing conflict.
