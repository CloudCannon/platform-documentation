Integrating a site in CloudCannon means getting your data and content to an editable state. A good starting point for this process is [completing a successful build](/documentation/articles/configuring-your-build/).

Follow these steps to fully integrate your site:

## 1. Create a global configuration file

The [global configuration](/documentation/articles/setting-global-configuration/) file is the heart of your integration with CloudCannon.

## 2. Define your collections

[Defining your collections](/documentation/articles/defining-your-collections/) in the [global configuration](/documentation/articles/setting-global-configuration/) file creates the base navigation for your content, organizes your files into groups, and populates the metadata used in file previews.

The navigation plays a crucial rule directing team members where to edit content in CloudCannon.

## 3. Refine your editing experience

At this point you should have a good base integration with CloudCannon. There are a number of optional features from here that improve the editing experience. Depending on your site and use case, each feature will have a different priority for you.

The rest of the documentation covers these features in depth, and here are some suggestions to get started:

* Learn about the different editors on offer:
  * [Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-visual-editor/)
  * [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-data-editor/)
  * [Content Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-content-editor/)
  * [Source Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-source-editor/)

* Change the [grouping and order of your navigation](/documentation/articles/introducing-your-site-navigation/)
* [Customize your inputs](/documentation/articles/how-to-choose-what-input-is-used-in-the-data-editor/) to better represent your content and data
* Set up live editing by visually [binding your data](/documentation/articles/what-are-visual-data-bindings/) and rendering it live with [previews](/documentation/articles/what-is-live-editing/)

## Integration tools

**You don't have to install integration tools or generate integration files yourself**.

CloudCannon integrates your site through a JSON file automatically generated during your build. This file contains your global configuration and metadata from your collections and files. The integration file is generated for you with one of the following automatically installed plugins or tools:

* Jekyll: [cloudcannon-jekyll](https://github.com/CloudCannon/cloudcannon-jekyll)
* Hugo: [cloudcannon-hugo](https://github.com/CloudCannon/cloudcannon-hugo)
* Eleventy: [eleventy-plugin-cloudcannon](https://github.com/CloudCannon/eleventy-plugin-cloudcannon)
* Other: [reader](https://github.com/CloudCannon/reader)

  Check your build output to see logs and potential warnings from these integration tools to diagnose issues.
