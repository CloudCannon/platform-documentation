There is only one type of URL input:

* URL

## URL input types

### URL

The URL input provides an editing interface for relative, absolute, and fully qualified URLs.

Your URL input may also have input validation, which requires the value to match predefined criteria before you can save your changes.

If you enter a value under the minimum or over the maximum character count, CloudCannon will display an error message in red text under the input field.

If your developer has configured a pattern for your input value (such as specific file extensions), CloudCannon will warn you when the value does not match the pattern. CloudCannon will show any error messages underneath the input field in red.
