How you set global configuration in CloudCannon has changed. We recommend updating, but the previous configuration will continue to work. CloudCannon now uses specific files rather than relying on your SSG configuration files. This allows us to provide a consistent experience across SSGs as we add more. This also separates the configuration itself, making your sites more maintainable.

To migrate, [create a global configuration file with these instructions](/documentation/articles/create-a-global-configuration-file/), then move your configuration here.

Many of the configuration keys are the same, and listed in [setting global configuration options](/documentation/articles/create-a-global-configuration-file/#options). Globally-scoped [configuration cascade values](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/) must also be moved if a global configuration file exists.

Here are the notable changes for your specific SSG:



<comp.Conditional ssgs={["Jekyll"]}>
  CloudCannon used to read global configuration from your `_config.yml` file.

  Base collection configuration is still automatically read from Jekyll itself. Collection settings are now set under `collections_config` in your global configuration file rather than in `collections` or `cloudcannon.collections` inside `_config.yml`. The contents are the same, except for [these renamed keys](#renamed-keys). Read more about [defining your collections](/documentation/articles/define-your-collections/).

  Including data files is now set in `data_config` in your global configuration file rather than in `cloudcannon.data` in `_config.yml`. The format is the same.

  Your global uploads path is now set in `paths.uploads` in your global configuration file rather than in `uploads_dir` in `_config.yml`. The format is the same.
</comp.Conditional>



<comp.Conditional ssgs={["Hugo"]}>
  CloudCannon used to read global configuration from your `config.toml` file.

  Base collection configuration is still automatically read from Hugo top-level content sections. Collection configuration is now set under `collections_config` in your global configuration file rather than in `cloudcannon.collections` inside `config.toml`. The contents are the same, except for [these renamed keys](#renamed-keys). Read more about [defining your collections](/documentation/articles/define-your-collections/).

  Including data files is now set in `data_config` in your global configuration file rather than in `cloudcannon.data` in `config.toml`. The format is the same.

  Your global uploads path is now set in `paths.uploads` in your global configuration file rather than in `uploads_dir` in `config.toml`. The format is the same.
</comp.Conditional>



<comp.Conditional ssgs={["Eleventy"]}>
  CloudCannon used to read global configuration from your `_data/cloudcannon.*` file.

  Base collection configuration is still automatically read from Eleventy itself. Collection configuration is now set under `collections_config` in your global configuration file rather than in `collections` inside `_data/cloudcannon.*`. The contents are the same, except for [these renamed keys](#renamed-keys). Read more about [defining your collections](/documentation/articles/define-your-collections/).

  By overwhelming demand, **defining collection configuration no longer overrides automatically-discovered collections**. If you want to restore this behavior, use the `collections_config_override` global setting.

  Including data files is now set in `data_config` in your global configuration file rather than in `data` in `_data/cloudcannon.*`. The format is the same.

  Your global uploads path is now set in `paths.uploads` in your global configuration file rather than in `uploads_dir` in `_data/cloudcannon.*`. The format is the same.
</comp.Conditional>



<comp.Conditional not_ssgs={["Jekyll", "Eleventy", "Hugo"]}>
  CloudCannon already reads global configuration from your `cloudcannon.config.*` file for other SSGs. There are a couple of extra renamed keys here:

  * `collections-config` to `collections_config`
  * `data-config` to `data_config`
  * `base-url` to `base_url`
</comp.Conditional>



### Renamed keys
Since collection-level configuration is now always defined separately, there's no longer any risk of clashing with SSG-specific configuration. We've taken this chance to clean up and rename the configuration keys that started with underscores in an effort to reduce that risk:

* `_collection_groups` to `collection_groups`
* `_source_editor` to `source_editor`
* `_subtext_key` to `subtext_key` inside `collections_config`
* `_image_key` to `image_key` inside `collections_config`
* `_image_size` to `image_size` inside `collections_config`
* `_singular_name` to `singular_name` inside `collections_config`
* `_singular_key` to `singular_key` inside `collections_config`
* `_disable_add` to `disable_add` inside `collections_config`
* `_icon` to `icon` inside `collections_config`
* `_add_options` to `add_options` inside `collections_config`
* `_sort_key` to `sort_key` inside `collections_config`

`sort_key` has been superseded by `sort` and `sort_options` [has been introduced](/documentation/articles/define-your-collections/).

The remaining underscore-prefixed configuration keys are not renamed so they can be identified as part of the [configuration cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/).
