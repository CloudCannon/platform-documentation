A [Custom Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/) is a unique address used to identify a website. You can purchase a Domain Name from a Domain Registrar.

To add a Custom Domain to a Site in CloudCannon:

1. Open the Site to which you want to add the Custom Domain.
2. Navigate to the *Custom Domain* page under *Site Settings*.
3. Select the *Add new custom domain* option in the *Choose your hosting option* dropdown.
4. In the *Domain Name* text field, enter the domain and tld of you want to connect to this Site (e.g., example.com).
5. Click the *Add Domain* button.

CloudCannon will connect your Custom Domain to your Site.

The domain will now appear in your *Domain browser*, which you can access from your *Organization Dashboard*.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/hosting/add-a-custom-domain/2024-11/CloudCannon-Documentation-Domains-Browser-Page.png" alt="A screenshot of the Domain Browser shows four Domain cards with metadata for connected Sites, DNS, and SSL certificate expiry date." title="The Domain Browser" type="screenshot"/>

To see your Site content live on your domain, you must set up your [DNS](/documentation/articles/what-is-dns/). For more information, please read our documentation on [configuring CloudCannon DNS](/documentation/articles/configure-cloudcannon-dns/) (recommended) or [configuring external DNS](/documentation/articles/configure-external-dns/).

We also recommend adding an [SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/) to your Site. For more information, please read our documentation on [adding an auto-generated SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/add-an-auto-generated-ssl-certificate/) or [adding a custom SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/add-a-custom-ssl-certificate/).

To stop hosting your Site on a Custom Domain, navigate to the *Danger Zone* tab on the *Custom Domain* page and click the *Remove Custom Domain* button.

A [subdomain](/documentation/articles/add-a-custom-domain-to-your-site/#host-on-a-subdomain) is an additional name on the front of your URL. Subdomains help you to separate and organize content on your Site.

To connect a subdomain, you must have access to the main domain name.

To add a custom subdomain to a Site in CloudCannon:

1. Open the Site to which you want to add the subdomain.
2. Navigate to the *Custom Domain* page under *Site Settings*.
3. Select the *Add new custom domain* option in the *Choose your hosting option* dropdown.
4. In the *Domain Name* text field, enter the subdomain, domain, and TLD of the Site you want to connect to (e.g., support.example.com).
5. Click the *Add Domain* button.

CloudCannon will connect your subdomain to your Site.

Subdomains do not get a dedicated Card in the *Domains browser*. Instead, your Site will appear in the list of Sites using the main domain name (i.e., the Site connected to support.example.com will appear in the list of Sites connected to example.com).

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/hosting/add-a-custom-domain/2024-11/CloudCannon-Documentation-Domains-Browser-Page.png" alt="A screenshot of the Domain Browser shows four Domain cards with metadata for connected Sites, DNS, and SSL certificate expiry date." title="The Domain Browser" type="screenshot"/>

To stop hosting your Site on a subdomain, navigate to the *Danger Zone* tab on the *Custom Domain* page and click the *Remove Custom Domain* button.

## Host your Site on a subdomain

If you want your main domain to be a subdomain, you need to redirect your base domain name to the subdomain.

To set a subdomain as your main domain:

1. Create two Sites, one with your main domain and one with a subdomain.
2. Navigate to the *Domain browser* from your *Org Navigation* or *Organization Dashboard*.
3. Click the Card for the domain you want to configure.
4. Open the *Domain Settings* tab and navigate to the *Redirects* section.
5. Click the *Set Main Domain* button on the Site you want CloudCannon to treat as your main domain.

CloudCannon will redirect all unused subdomains (including the base domain) to your main domain.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  If you have configured your [DNS](/documentation/articles/what-is-dns/) to point a specific domain at a service outside of CloudCannon, CloudCannon will not be able to redirect that domain to your main domain.

A subpath is an additional name prefixing your page slug and suffixing your domain name. Subpaths help you to separate and organize content on your Site.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/hosting/what-is-web-hosting/2024-11/CloudCannon-Documentation-URL-Structure-Diagram.png" alt="A diagram of a URL shows labels for protocol, subdomain, domain, top-level domain, subdirectory, slug, and path." title="The structure of a URL" type="ui-snippet"/>

To connect your Site to a subpath, you must have access to the main domain name and be hosting a CloudCannon Site on the main domain.

To host your Site on a subpath:

1. Open the Site you want to host on a subpath.
2. Navigate to the *Custom Domain* page under *Site Settings*.
3. Select the *Attach on subpath of existing site* option in the *Choose your hosting option* dropdown.
4. In the *Existing Site* dropdown, select the CloudCannon Site connected to the main domain you want to use.
5. In the *Subpath* text field, enter the name of the subpath on which you want to host this Site (e.g., documentation). You do not have to include any `/` characters.
6. Click the *Attach to subpath* button.

CloudCannon will now host this Site on a subpath.

Subpaths do not get a dedicated Card in the *Domains browser*. Instead, your Site will appear in the list of Sites using the main domain name (i.e., the Site connected to support.example.com will appear in the list of Sites connected to example.com).

To stop hosting your Site on a subpath, navigate to the *Danger Zone* tab on the *Custom Domain* page and click the *Remove Custom Domain* button.
