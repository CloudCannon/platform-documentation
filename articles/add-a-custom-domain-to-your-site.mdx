&nbsp;

A subdomain is an additional name on the front of your URL (e.g., docs.example.com). A subpath is an additional name prefixing your page slug and suffixing your domain name (e.g., example.com/staff/). Subdomains and subpaths help you to separate and organize content on your Site.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  You can configure both a subdomain and a subpath for each Site on CloudCannon, if your configuration requires them.
</comp.Notice>

These instructions assume you have [connected a Custom Domain to your Organization](/documentation/articles/connect-a-custom-domain-to-your-organization/) and, if you want to host on a subdomain or subpath, that you already have a Site hosted on your base domain.

To add a Custom Domain to your Site:

1. Click the *Sites* button in the *App Sidebar*. CloudCannon will open the *Sites browser*.
2. Identify the Site from which you want to remove a Custom Domain and click on the *Site* card. CloudCannon will open the *Dashboard* for that Site.
3. Navigate to the *Custom Domain* page under *Site Settings*.
4. Select the Custom Domain you want to add using the *Base Domain* dropdown.
5. (Optional.) If you want to host your Site on a subdomain or subpath of your Custom Domain, enter the subdomain in the *Base Domain* text field, or the subpath in the *Subpath* text field. Leave these fields blank if you do not want to configure a subdomain or subpath for your Site.
6. Click the *Add a Domain* button.

CloudCannon will begin hosting your website content on your Custom Domain.

You can manage your

including subdomains and subpaths

Subdomains do not get a dedicated Card in the *Domains browser*. Instead, your Site will appear in the list of Sites using the main domain name (i.e., the Site connected to support.example.com will appear in the list of Sites connected to example.com).

Subpaths do not get a dedicated Card in the *Domains browser*. Instead, your Site will appear in the list of Sites using the main domain name (i.e., the Site connected to support.example.com will appear in the list of Sites connected to example.com).

To stop hosting your Site on a Custom Domain, please read our documentation on [removing a Custom Domain from your Site](/documentation/articles/remove-a-custom-domain-from-your-site/).

We also recommend adding an [SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/) to your Site. For more information, please read our documentation on [adding an auto-generated SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/add-an-auto-generated-ssl-certificate/) or [adding a custom SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/add-a-custom-ssl-certificate/).
