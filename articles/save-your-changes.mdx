Whenever you [edit your files](/documentation/articles/edit-your-files/), CloudCannon will remember any updates you make in-app. To see your updates live on your site or commit them to your Git repository, you must save your changes.

Any team member can review and save file changes, even if they did not contribute to those edits.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  It is important to save your changes often, as unsaved changes can prevent other updates to your site. We recommend saving your site after every editing session.
</comp.Notice>

To save your changes:

1. Click the *Save* button in the *Site navigation* sidebar or the top right of your editing interface. CloudCannon will open the *Review changes* modal.
2. Review your changes and select the files you would like to save.
3. Once you are happy with your changes, click the *Save selected* button.

CloudCannon will rebuild your site and commit your changes to your git repository. Once the build is complete, your changes will be live on your [test URL](/documentation/articles/viewing-your-site-on-a-testing-domain/) and any other [domain connected to your site](/documentation/articles/hosting-your-site-on-a-custom-domain/).

## Review your changes

Clicking the *Save* button will open the *Review changes* modal and provide a comprehensive list of the unsaved changes on your site.

Each file card will have a [file badge](/documentation/articles/edit-your-files/#file-badges) to indicated the type of unsaved changes, and the details of that file, such as the title, filename, collection (if applicable), when it was last edited, and who contributed to those edits.

You can choose which files with unsaved changes you want to save. Use the checkboxes next to each file card to select individual files, or use the *Checkbox dropdown* at the top of the modal to select multiple files. The *Checkbox dropdown* has options for *My edits*, *Files edited only by me*, and *All edits*. These options allow you to mass-select any file with unsaved changes you contributed to, inclusive or exclusive of other team member contributions, or all files with unsaved changes.

By default, the *Review changes* modal will select all files where you have contributed to.

You can discard unsaved changes using the *Context menu* in the top right of the file card. When you are happy with the changes made to your site, click the *Save selected* button in the bottom right of the modal.

### Inputs

Some file cards may have input fields depending on your SSG and how you have configured your site. These fields may be required before you can save your changes.

Common examples of required inputs are file name, title, and date. Which inputs are required depends on how you have configured your site, particularly the [default path for new files](/documentation/articles/choosing-where-to-create-new-files/).

<comp.Conditional ssgs={["Jekyll"]}>
  For Jekyll sites, new posts require a date. If you have not added one during your editing session, the *Review changes* modal will prompt you to do so before you can save your site.
</comp.Conditional>

### Commit messages

If you or a team member has [configured commit messages](/documentation/articles/formatting-your-commit-messages/) for your site, your *Review changes* modal will have a commit message field. This field may be required before you can save your changes.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/editing/save-changes/2024-Q1/CloudCannon-Documentation-Save-Changes-Commit-Message.png" alt="The Review changes modal with a commit message describing the changes made to the site." title="Commit messages in the Review changes modal with commit message field" type="ui-snippet"/>

A commit message should summarize the theme of your changes. Good commit messages will help you and other team members in the future by providing a record of why you updated your site. For example:

“Added a profile image and updated the Staff and Contact pages to include our new consultant, Deborah.”

We recommend the following best practices for commit messages:

* Clearly state the purpose of your changes by using imperative verbs (e.g., Added, Updated, Deleted, Fixed, etc.).
* Avoid vague descriptions like “updated code” or “fixed typo”. Be specific.
* Reference any relevant context, such as issue numbers, discussions, or contacts.
