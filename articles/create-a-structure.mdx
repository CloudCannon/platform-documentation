A structure is a predefined, custom object template that determine what should populate an [array](/documentation/articles/using-arrays-to-edit-your-data/) or [object input](/documentation/articles/editing-objects-in-your-data/). You can use structures for any objects you want to repeat across your site, such as testimonials, image galleries, or page-building components.

Team members can easily add, remove, reorder, and update structures in the [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-data-editor/) or the sidebar of the [Visual](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-visual-editor/) or [Content Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-content-editor/).

## Structures and arrays

Structures and arrays go hand-in-hand. The [array input](/documentation/articles/using-arrays-to-edit-your-data/) contains an ordered list of related items, while a structure is a template that determines what data CloudCannon should add to new array items. By creating structures, you can define different objects that your team members can add to arrays within your site.

### Default array behavior

When you first connect your site files and make them editable in the Data Editor, CloudCannon will automatically detect arrays in your front matter and data files.

You can add new items to your arrays without the need for configuration. Clicking the *\+ Add* button for an array will clone the last array item and clear the data from the new item to create a blank array object. This behavior is convenient if you have simple arrays, or do not want to configure structures.

The default array behavior may not be right for you if:

* Your array does not contain at least one object.
* You want to have different object types in your array.

Because the default behavior clones existing array items, CloudCannon will prevent you from removing the last item from an array if you do not have a structure configured. Additionally, cloning existing items does not allow for variation of object types. You can add different objects to the array manually using the [Source Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-source-editor/). However, this can become inefficient to maintain.

You can overcome these limitations by configuring data structures to add to your arrays.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Alternatively, [configure inline array inputs](/documentation/articles/using-arrays-to-edit-your-data/#inline-values) to set which input is used for array items. This also allows array to be empty.
</comp.Notice>

## Structures and objects

Structures also work for individual objects. The [object input](/documentation/articles/editing-objects-in-your-data/) can contain a maximum of one value. When a structure is applied to an object input, team members can select which option from the structure they want to add to that object. Once a value is selected, you cannot add more until the value is replaced or deleted.

## Create a structure

You can configure your structures at any level of the [configuration cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/). Global structures, which affect every array on your site, are configured in your [global configuration file](/documentation/articles/create-a-global-configuration-file/) under the object called `_structures`. For more information, including how to define structures at other levels of the configuration cascade, read our reference documentation on [structures in the configuration cascade](/documentation/articles/structures-in-the-configuration-cascade/).

You can edit your global configuration file by opening it in the Source Editor.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Currently, you cannot configure the values for your structures in the Configuration GUI.
</comp.Notice>

To create a structure:

1. Navigate to your global configuration file and open it in the Source Editor.
2. Identify the `_structures` object, or create one.
3. Add your structure within the `_structures` object.
4. [Save your changes](/documentation/articles/save-your-changes/) to the global configuration file.

Here is an example of a basic structure:

<comp.CodeBlock language="yaml" source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
```
_structures: #1
  example: #2
    values: #3
      - value: #4
          name:
          description:
          image:
```
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  1
</comp.Annotation> <comp.Annotation number="2">
  The key name of your structure. In this code we have called our structure `example`. You can call your structure anything you want.
</comp.Annotation> <comp.Annotation number="3">
  3
</comp.Annotation> <comp.Annotation number="4">
  4
</comp.Annotation></comp.CodeBlock>

Let’s go over an example of how you would create a structure.

We want to allow your team members to add new objects to an array with fields for name, description, and image. We will use the key `example` and [define the input type](/documentation/articles/configure-your-inputs/) as an array.

Here is our structure configuration:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="Global Configuration File">
```
_structures:
  example:
    values:
      - value:
          name:
          description:
          image:

_inputs:
    example:
      type: array
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

Here is the front matter of the file containing our array:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="">
```
example: []
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

Once you save the global configuration file, your team can click the *\+ Add Example* button below the array and immediately have a new object added. You can also remove all the objects within the array, as the template for creating new array objects is saved within the structure.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/editing/structures/2024-Q1/CloudCannon-Documentation-Empty-Array-Example.png" alt="An empty array with the option to add an item." title="An empty array" type="ui-snippet"/>

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/editing/structures/2024-Q1/CloudCannon-Documentation-Example-Structure-Fields.png" alt="The sidebar of the Content Editor shows an object in an array with fields for Name, Description, and Image." title="An object within an array" type="ui-snippet"/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  In this example, the inputs called “name”, “description”, and “image” should also be configured somewhere in the [configuration cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/). For more information, read our documentation on [configuring your inputs](/documentation/articles/configure-your-inputs/).
</comp.Notice>

If we wanted our input `example` to have a maximum of one value, we can use an object input rather than an array.

Here is our structure configuration:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="Global Configuration File">
```
_structures:
  example:
    values:
      - value:
          name:
          description:
          image:

_inputs:
    example:
      type: object
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

Here is the front matter of the file containing our object:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="">
```
example: []
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

### Add multiple options to a structure

You can create multiple options for a structure to give your team a selection of object templates.

For this example, we want to allow your team members to be able to add another object type to the array. This new object will contain the fields for heading and subtext. Let’s add a new structure under our previous example.

Because we have more than one value for this structure, adding a label to each option is important. Define your label on the same level as the `value` key with the `label` key.

Here is our new structure configuration:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="Global Configuration File">
```
_structures:
  example:
    values:
      - label: First
        value:
          name:
          description:
          image:
      - label: Second
        value:
          heading:
          subtext:
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

Once you save the global configuration file, your team can click the *\+ Add Example* button below the array to see a dropdown menu listing available structures for this array.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/editing/structures/2024-Q1/CloudCannon-Documentation-Multiple-Structure-Options.png" alt="An empty array with the option to add an item from a list of options defined in the structure." title="An empty array" type="ui-snippet"/>

### Create a structures modal

As you create more options for your structure, a dropdown may not be the best way to view your options. If you have many structures, a pop-up modal might be better. We can use the style key to switch from a dropdown to a pop-up modal.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="Global Configuration File">
```
_structures:
  example:
    style: modal
    values:
      - label: First
        value:
          name:
          description:
          image:
      - label: Second
        value:
          heading:
          subtext:
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

The `style` key has two values: “select” and “modal”. When the `style` key is not configured, CloudCannon sets the style to “select” by default. When set to `select`, clicking the *\+ Add* button for an array creates a dropdown menu. When set to `modal`, the *\+ Add* button will create a pop-up modal that allows you to search all available options for that structure and utilize images, icons, and descriptions to define each option clearly.

To switch to a modal, set the `style` key to `modal`.

For more information on how to use images, icons, and descriptions to customize your structure options in a dropdown or modal, read our documentation on [configuring your structure previews](/documentation/articles/configure-your-structure-previews/).
