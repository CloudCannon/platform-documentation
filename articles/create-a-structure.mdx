A structure is a predefined, custom object you can add to an array. You can use structures for any objects you want to repeat across your site, such as testimonials, image galleries, or page-building components.

Team members can easily add, remove, reorder, and update structures in the [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-data-editor/) or the sidebar of the [Visual](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-visual-editor/) or [Content Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-content-editor/).

## Structures and arrays

Structures and arrays go hand-in-hand. The [array input](/documentation/articles/using-arrays-to-edit-your-data/) contains an ordered list of related items, while a structure is a template that determines what data CloudCannon should add to new array items. By creating structures, you can define different objects that your team members can add to arrays within your site.

### Default array behavior

When you first connect your site files and make them editable in the Data Editor, CloudCannon will automatically detect arrays in your front matter and data files.

<comp.DocsImage path="" alt="" title=""/>

You can add new items to your arrays without the need for configuration. Clicking the *\+ Add* button for an array will clone the last array item and clear the data from the new item to create a blank array object. This behavior is convenient if you do not want to configure structures or have simple arrays.

The default array behavior may not be right for you if:

* Your array does not contain at least one object.
* You want to have different object types in your array.

Because the default behavior clones existing array items, CloudCannon will prevent you from removing the last item from an array if you do not have a structure configured. Additionally, cloning existing items does not allow for variation of object types. You can add different objects to the array manually using the [Source Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-source-editor/). However, this can become inefficient to maintain.

You can overcome these limitations by configuring data structures to add to your arrays.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Alternatively, [configure inline array inputs](/documentation/articles/using-arrays-to-edit-your-data/#inline-values) to set which input is used for array items. This also allows array to be empty.
</comp.Notice>

## Structures and objects

Structures also work for individual objects. The [object input](/documentation/articles/editing-objects-in-your-data/) can contain a maximum of one value. When a structure is applied to an object input, team members can select which option from the structure they want to add to that object. Once a value is selected, you cannot add more until the value is replaced or deleted.

## Create a structure

You can configure your structures at any level of the [configuration cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/). Global structures, which affect every array on your site, are configured in your [global configuration file](/documentation/articles/create-a-global-configuration-file/) under the object called `_structures`. We will cover other locations in the configuration cascade later in this article.

You can edit your global configuration file by opening it in the Source Editor.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Currently, you cannot configure the values for your structures in the Configuration GUI.
</comp.Notice>

To create a structure:

1. Navigate to your global configuration file and open it in the Source Editor.
2. Identify the `_structures` object, or create one.
3. Within `_structures`, enter the key name for your structure.
4. Select the [input](/documentation/articles/configure-your-inputs/) fields for each value in the structure.
5. [Save your changes](/documentation/articles/save-your-changes/) to the global configuration file.

Letâ€™s go over an example of how you would create a structure.

We want to allow your team members to add new objects to an array with fields for name, description, and image. We will use the key `example` and [define the input type](/documentation/articles/configure-your-inputs/) as an array.

Here is our structure configuration:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={[null, "json"]} source="Global Configuration File">
```
_structures:
  example:
    values:
      - value:
          name:
          description:
          image:

_inputs:
    example:
      type: array
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

Here is the front matter of the file containing our array:

## Structures

Array add values are defined under the key `_structures`. These allow you to define which keys in your data should be arrays, what data should be added when **Add** is clicked, and how the editor can decide what item to add.

If you add keys to your structure definition, any existing instances of that structure will have those keys added the next time it is loaded in CloudCannon.

### Defining your key

The first step to configuring your structures is to define which key is used. For this example we will use the `example` key. If `_structures` is already defined, add your key to that object. Key level config in structures do not get merged; the latest defined key will be the only config. Below is the basic structure once your key is chosen:

<comp.Tabs label="Languages">
 <comp.Tab name="YAML">
    <comp.CodeBlock language="yaml" source="Configuration">
    ```
    _structures:
      example:
        # Configure example key in here
    ```
    </comp.CodeBlock>
 </comp.Tab>
  <comp.Tab name="TOML">
    <comp.CodeBlock language="toml" source="Configuration">
    ```
    [[_structures.example]]
    # Configure example key in here
    ```
    </comp.CodeBlock>
 </comp.Tab>
  <comp.Tab name="JSON">
    <comp.CodeBlock language="json" source="Configuration">
    ```
    {
      "_structures": {
        "example": {}
      }
    }
    ```
    </comp.CodeBlock>
 </comp.Tab>
</comp.Tabs>

### Defining a single value

For the first example we want editors to click **Add** and immediately have the following data added:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json", "toml"]} source="New Item Content">
```
name:
description:
image:
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

For this we need to add our new structure under a `value` key inside an array called `values`:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json", "toml"]} source="Configuration">
```
_structures:
  example:
    values:
      - value:
          name:
          description:
          image:
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

Our editors can now add a new value to our array and remove every array item because we have moved our add instructions into the `_structures` config.

<comp.DocsImage path="/documentation/static/inputs/structures/empty-structure.png" alt="An empty array with the option to add an item" title="" type="screenshot-snippet"/>

### Defining a second value

For the second example we want editors to click **Add** and be prompted for a choice of options. We are going to add the following structure to our structures:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json", "toml"]} source="New Item Content">
```
heading:
subtext:
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

For this we need to add our new structure under our previous in the array called `values`. Now that we have more than one option, it is important to label our values. Labels are defined on the same level as the `value` key with the `label` key. Here is our new configuration:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="yaml" translate_into={["json", "toml"]} source="Configuration">
```
_structures:
  example:
    values:
      - label: 'First'
        value:
          name:
          description:
          image:
      - label: 'Second'
        value:
          heading:
          subtext:
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

<comp.DocsImage path="/documentation/static/inputs/structures/dropdown-selector.png" alt="An empty array with two add options in a dropdown" title="" type="screenshot-snippet"/>

<comp.DocsImage path="/documentation/static/inputs/structures/structure-with-values.png" alt="An array with two add options in a dropdown and two existing items" title="" type="screenshot-snippet"/>

There are a number of ways to change the way your array values look, just like the `label` key. These include the `description`, `icon`, `image`, and `image_size` keys. See the [structures reference](/documentation/articles/array-structures-reference/) for more details on these keys.
