## What is a structure?

A structure is a predefined, custom template that determines what should populate an [array](/documentation/articles/using-arrays-to-edit-your-data/) or [object input](/documentation/articles/editing-objects-in-your-data/). With the click of a button, you can easily add fields to an array or object from your list of predefined structures.

Structures are excellent for creating items you want to repeat across your site. An image gallery structure might contain fields for an image, an author, and a caption. A testimonial structure might contain fields for a quote and an author. An array using page-building components might reference several structures for common content blocks, such as a hero image, call to action, or video block

Once you have defined your structures, your team members can easily add, remove, reorder, and update structure content using the [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-data-editor/) or the sidebar of the [Visual](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-visual-editor/) or [Content Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-content-editor/).

In this article, we’ll cover how to:

* Create a basic structure
* Reference a structure in an array or object input
* Add multiple structures to the same key

For more information, including a list of all keys available for structure configuration, please read our reference documentation for [structures](/documentation/articles/array-structures-reference/).

### Structures and arrays

Structures and arrays go hand-in-hand. The [array input](/documentation/articles/using-arrays-to-edit-your-data/) contains an ordered list of related items, while a structure is a template that determines what data CloudCannon should add to new array items. By creating structures, you can define different objects that your team members can add to arrays within your site.

### Default array behavior

When you first connect your site files and make them editable in the Data Editor, CloudCannon will automatically detect arrays in your front matter and data files.

You can add new items to your arrays without the need for configuration. Clicking the *\+ Add* button for an array will clone the last array item and clear the data from the new item to create a blank array object. This behavior is convenient if you have simple arrays, or do not want to configure structures.

The default array behavior may not be right for you if:

* Your array does not contain at least one object.
* You want to have different object types in your array.

Because the default behavior clones existing array items, CloudCannon will prevent you from removing the last item from an array if you do not have a structure configured. Additionally, cloning existing items does not allow for variation of object types. You can add different objects to the array manually using the [Source Editor](/documentation/articles/introducing-the-source-editor/). However, this can become inefficient to maintain.

You can overcome these limitations by configuring data structures to add to your arrays.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Alternatively, [configure inline array inputs](/documentation/articles/using-arrays-to-edit-your-data/#inline-values) to set which input is used for array items. This also allows array to be empty.
</comp.Notice>

### Structures and objects

Structures also work for individual objects. The [object input](/documentation/articles/editing-objects-in-your-data/) can contain a maximum of one value. When a structure is applied to an object input, team members can select which structure they want to add to that object. Once a value is selected, you cannot add more until the value is replaced or deleted.

## Create a structure

In CloudCannon, you can configure structures under the key called `_structures`.

You can configure your structures at any level of the [configuration cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/). Global structures, which affect every array on your site, are configured in your [global configuration file](/documentation/articles/create-a-global-configuration-file/). For more information, including how to define structures at other levels of the configuration cascade, read our reference documentation on [structures in the configuration cascade](/documentation/articles/structures-in-the-configuration-cascade/).

You can edit your global configuration file by opening it in the Source Editor.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Currently, you cannot configure the values for your structures in the Configuration GUI.
</comp.Notice>

To create a structure:

1. Navigate to your global configuration file and open it in the Source Editor.
2. Identify the `_structures` object, or create one.
3. Add your structure within the `_structures` object.
4. [Save your changes](/documentation/articles/save-your-changes/) to the global configuration file.

Here is an example of a basic structure:

<comp.CodeBlock language="yaml" source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
```
_structures: #1
  example: #2
    values: #3
      - value: #4
          name:
          description:
          image:
```
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  The `_structures` object contains all the structures defined at a given level of the configuration cascade.
</comp.Annotation> <comp.Annotation number="2">
  The key name of your structure. In this code we have called our structure `example`. You can call your structure anything you want.
</comp.Annotation> <comp.Annotation number="3">
  The `example.values` key contains an array of options for this structure. We will cover [multiple structures](documentation/articles/create-a-structure/#add-multiple-structures) stored under a single key later in this article.
</comp.Annotation> <comp.Annotation number="4">
  A structure in the group called `example`. This structure contains fields for `name`, `description`, and `image`.
</comp.Annotation></comp.CodeBlock>

In the above code, we have created a simple structure under the key `example`. This structure contains the fields for `name`, `description`, and `image`. This structure can be referenced in any array or object input.

### Array example

Let’s go over an example of how you would create a structure.

We want to allow your team members to add new objects to an array with fields for name, description, and image. We will use the key `example` and [define the input type](/documentation/articles/configure-your-inputs/) as an array.

Here is our structure configuration:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="Global Configuration File">
```
_structures:
  example:
    values:
      - value:
          name:
          description:
          image:

_inputs:
    example:
      type: array
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

Here is the front matter of the file containing our array:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="">
```
example: []
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

Once you save the global configuration file, your team can click the *\+ Add Example* button below the array and immediately have a new object added. You can also remove all the objects within the array, as the template for creating new array objects is saved within the structure.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/editing/structures/2024-Q1/CloudCannon-Documentation-Empty-Array-Example.png" alt="An empty array with the option to add an item." title="An empty array" type="ui-snippet"/>

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/editing/structures/2024-Q1/CloudCannon-Documentation-Example-Structure-Fields.png" alt="The sidebar of the Content Editor shows an object in an array with fields for Name, Description, and Image." title="An object within an array" type="ui-snippet"/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  In this example, the inputs called “name”, “description”, and “image” should also be configured somewhere in the [configuration cascade](/documentation/articles/using-the-configuration-cascade/). For more information, read our documentation on [configuring your inputs](/documentation/articles/configure-your-inputs/).
</comp.Notice>

### Object example

If we wanted our input `example` to have a maximum of one value, we can use an object input rather than an array.

Here is our structure configuration:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="Global Configuration File">
```
_structures:
  example:
    values:
      - value:
          name:
          description:
          image:

_inputs:
    example:
      type: object
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

Here is the front matter of the file containing our object:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="">
```
example: []
```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

## Add multiple structures to the same key

CloudCannon can store multiple structures under a single key. By creating an array of structures under a single key, you can provide your team with a selection of object templates for any array or object input.

When referencing a key which contains multiple structures, all the structures within that key are available. Therefore, the key becomes the name of a groups of structures, rather than a single structure.

Here is an example of multiple structures under one key:

<comp.CodeBlock language="YAML" source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
```
_structures:
  example: #1
    values: #2
      - label: First #3
        value:
          name:
          description:
          image:
      - label: Second #4
        value:
          heading:
          subtext:
```
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  The key name of your group of structures. In this code we have called our structure `example`.
</comp.Annotation> <comp.Annotation number="2">
  The `example.values` key contains an array of structures. Each structure in this array is named using the `label` key.
</comp.Annotation> <comp.Annotation number="3">
  The first structure in the group called `example`. This structure contains fields for `name`, `description`, and `image`.
</comp.Annotation> <comp.Annotation number="4">
  The second structure in the group called `example`. This structure is different from the first, containing fields for `heading` and `subtext`.
</comp.Annotation></comp.CodeBlock>

You can have as many structures under one key as you want. As you create multiple structures, it is important to add a label to each one. Define your label on the same level as the `value` key using the `label` key.

Multiple structures appear as a dropdown menu when you click the *\+ Add* button below an array or object.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/editing/structures/2024-Q1/CloudCannon-Documentation-Multiple-Structure-Options.png" alt="An empty array with the option to add an item from a list of options defined in the structure." title="An empty array" type="ui-snippet"/>

However, as you create more structures, a dropdown may not be the best way to view them. You can create a searchable pop-up modal to view your structures using the `style` key.

<comp.CodeBlock language="YAML" source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
```
_structures:
  example:
		style: modal #1
    values:
      - label: First
        value:
          name:
          description:
          image:
      - label: Second
        value:
          heading:
          subtext:
```
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  The `style` key is set to `modal`. Define the style key on the same level as the `values` key under the name of your structures group.
</comp.Annotation></comp.CodeBlock>

The `style` key has two values: “select” and “modal”. When the `style` key is not configured, CloudCannon sets the style to `select` by default.

When set to `select`, clicking the *\+ Add* button for an array or object creates a dropdown menu. When set to `modal`, the *\+ Add* button will create a pop-up modal. To switch to a modal, set the `style` key to `modal`.

You can [configure your structure previews](/documentation/articles/configure-your-structure-previews) to alter how each structure appears in the dropdown menu or pop-up modal. For more information, including how to use images, icons, and descriptions to customize your structures, read our documentation on [configuring your structure previews](/documentation/articles/configure-your-structure-previews/).
