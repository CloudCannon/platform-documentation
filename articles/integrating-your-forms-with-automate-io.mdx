You can integrate your CloudCannon forms with your [Automate.io](http://Automate.io) bots using webhooks and the Automate Inbox target.

To create an Automate webhook trigger:

1. If you haven't already, create an Automate account [here](https://automate.io/app/signup).
2. In the [Automate.io](http://Automate.io) console, open the *Bots* menu and click the *Create a new bot* button.
3. Select *Webhooks* as your trigger app and *Incoming Hook* as your trigger event.
4. Click the *Setup Webhook* button and copy the webhook URL.
5. Click the *I'm Done* button. [Automate.io](http://Automate.io) will now start waiting to receive a sample submission to that webhook URL.

To finish setting up the bot, you must first create the Automate target in CloudCannon and send a sample submission.

To create an Automate target:

1. Navigate to the forms menu in your Organization settings, under *Hosting &gt; Forms.*
2. Open your Inbox settings by clicking the *Manage* button on the Inbox you want to connect to [Automate.io](http://Automate.io).
3. Open the *Add new target* menu, and set the *Type* to *Automate.*
4. Set the *Target* to the webhook URL from your [Automate.io](http://Automate.io) bot, then click *Add Inbox target*.

Now, if you submit to that Inbox you should see it appear in the *Setup Webhook* window in [Automate.io](http://Automate.io). At this point, you can click the *Looks Good* button and finish setting up your bot.
