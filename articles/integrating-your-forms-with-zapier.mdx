You can integrate your CloudCannon forms with your Zapier zaps using webhooks and the Zapier Inbox target.

To create a Zapier webhook trigger:

1. If you haven't already, create a Zapier account [here](https://zapier.com/sign-up).
2. In the Zapier console, click the *Create Zap* button.
3. Select *Webhooks* as your trigger app and *Catch Hook* as your trigger event.
4. Click the *Continue* button, then copy the webhook URL and click *Continue* again.
5. Zapier is now waiting to receive a sample submission to that webhook URL.

To finish setting up the Zap, you must first create the Zapier target in CloudCannon and send a sample submission.

To create a Zapier target:

1. Navigate to the forms menu in your Organization settings, under *Hosting &gt; Forms.*
2. Open your Inbox settings by clicking the *Manage* button on the Inbox you want to connect to Zapier.
3. Open the *Add new target* menu, and set the *Type* to *Zapier.*
4. Set the *Target* to the webhook URL from your Zapier Zap, then click *Add Inbox target*.

Now, submit to that Inbox and then click *Test Trigger* in Zapier. At this point, you can click the *Continue* button and finish setting up your Zap.
