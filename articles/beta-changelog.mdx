## Resolve publishing conflicts

You can now resolve publishing conflicts in CloudCannon.

Publishing conflict resolution is available to the Owners, Developers, and Technical Editors [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/) and [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/) with the `site:source-editor:write` and `site:publish:upstream:write` permissions.

* When you click the *Update this site* button on the *Publishing* page to update your Site from its Publish Branch, CloudCannon may detect a publishing conflict. A publishing conflict occurs when the version of a file incoming from your Publish Branch and the version of the same file on your current branch do not match. Previously, you had to rely on your local developer environment or Git provider to resolve these conflicts.
* The *Publishing* page will show you a list of all files with incoming changes, including files with conflicts.
* When you click on the card for a conflicted file, CloudCannon will open the Source Editor and highlight the conflicted sections. CloudCannon will highlight the changes in the file from your current branch in red and the incoming changes from the Publish Branch in green.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-03/CloudCannon-Changelog-Resolve-Conflict-Source-Editor.png" alt="A screenshot of a file open in the Source Editor on the Publishing page highlights the change on the current branch and the incoming change from the Publish Branch." title="The Resolve Conflict Source Editor" type="ui-snippet"/>

* You can click on the *Use current* or *Use incoming* buttons to replace one change with another or click into the *Source Editor* to make a hybrid of the changes manually.
* You can quickly move to the next conflict in a large file by clicking the *Scroll to next conflict* button.
* When you have finished resolving conflicts in a file, you can click the *Mark resolved* button to save the file.
* When you have resolved all conflicted files, click the *Save all resolved files* button. CloudCannon will complete the update from your Publish Branch.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-03/CloudCannon-Changelog-Publish-Button-Conflicts-Notification.png" alt="A screenshot of the Publish button shows the Conflicts warning notification in the top right." title="The Publish button" type="ui-snippet"/>

* Once CloudCannon detects a publishing conflict, you cannot publish to your Publish Branch or save changes to your files.
* You must resolve the publishing conflict and update your Site from its Publish Branch or abandon the update attempt.
* If you resolve all publishing conflicts, CloudCannon will also save any unsaved changes made to your Site after the update attempt has begun. If you abandon your update attempt, CloudCannon will discard all unsaved changes.
  * We do not recommend editing your files while an update attempt is in progress. To prevent CloudCannon from detecting publishing conflicts while editing your Site, you cannot attempt to update from your Publish branch while you have unsaved changes.
* After abandoning your update attempt, you can return to editing your files and saving changes. CloudCannon will remove all warnings about publishing conflicts. However, you must still resolve your publishing conflicts before publishing from this Site to your Publish Branch.
* CloudCannon will remind you about any publishing conflicts the next time you try to publish from this Site or update from your Publish Branch.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-03/CloudCannon-Changelog-Cannot-Resolve-Conflicts-Notification.png" alt="A screenshot of the Update from Publish Branch notification shows that CloudCannon cannot resolve a publishing conflict." title="The Cannot Update notification" type="ui-snippet"/>

* If CloudCannon detects a publishing conflict that you cannot solve in the *Source Editor* (e.g., a conflict in an image file), a warning notification will appear on the *Publishing* page, directing you to resolve this conflict in your local developer environment.

## *Publishing* page updates

We improved the appearance and functionality of the *Publishing* page.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-03/CloudCannon-Changelog-Publishing-Page-Summary-Tab.png" alt="A screenshot of the Publishing page shows a Summary Tab, Changes Tab, and Commits Tab." title="The Publishing page" type="screenshot"/>

* The *Publishing* page now has a *Summary* tab. The *Changes* and *Commits* tabs have moved to the top of the page to be more consistent with other areas in the app.
* The *Summary* tab has three sections: the *Publish* section, *Changes* section, and *Commits* section.
  * The inputs in the *Publish* section allow you to publish your Site to its Publish Branch, or delete the Site. This section will look different depending on which publishing method you have enabled for your Site: merge changes immediately, or create a Pull Request for approval.
  * The *Changes* section on this tab shows the total number of files with saved changes and the three most recently changed files. It also has a *See more* link to the *Changes* tab.
  * The *Commits* section on this tab shows the two most recent commit made on this Site. It also has a *See more* link to the *Commits* tab.
* The *Changes* tab lists all the files with saved changes on your Site.
* The *Commits* tab lists all the commits made on your Site. If you click the *View* button on a commit card, CloudCannon will open that commit's page on your Git provider's website in another tab.

## *Domains* section updates

We improved the *Domains* section of the app and consolidated custom domain settings to this section from *Site Settings*.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-03/CloudCannon-Changelog-Domains-Browser.png" alt="A screenshot of the Domains Browser shows two domains, a search bar, and a Create a Domain button." title="The Domains Browser" type="screenshot"/>

* You can access the *Domains browser* by clicking the *Domains* button in the *App sidebar*.
* The *Domains browser* shows all domains connected to your Organization. Each domain is represented by a card.
* Domain card metadata shows you the status of your domain, how many CloudCannon Sites are connected to that domain, and whether the domain uses CloudCannon or External DNS.
* The *Domains browser* now has a *\+* *Create a Domain* button in the top right.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-03/CloudCannon-Changelog-Create-Domain-Page.png" alt="A screenshot of the Create a Domain page shows a text field for a Base Domain and a radio button for DNS provider." title="The Create a Domain page" type="screenshot"/>

* You can click the *\+* *Create a Domain* button to open the *Create a Domain* page.
* On the *Create a Domain* page, you can enter a *Base Domain* and select a *DNS Provider* option from CloudCannon or External.
* When you click the *Create Domain* button, CloudCannon will take you to that domain's *Domain* page.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-03/CloudCannon-Changelog-Domain-Page-Network-Tab.png" alt="A screenshot of the Network tab on the Domain page shows the status of domain Nameservers, subdomains, and fallback redirect." title="The Domain page" type="screenshot"/>

* Clicking on a domain card in the *Domains browser* will open the *Domain* page. The *Domain* page allows you to review and manage all settings for a given domain.
* The *Domain* page has four tabs: the *Network* tab, the *DNS* tab, the *Sites* tab, and the *Domain Settings* tab.
  * The *Network* tab shows the status of your *Nameservers*, lists all your subdomains in a *Subdomains browser*, and shows your *Fallback redirect* for all remaining subdomains.
  * The *DNS* tab lists all DNS records configured for your domain, and includes a search bar and *Create record* button in the top right. You can edit or delete each DNS record using the *Context Menu* in the top right of the card.
  * The *Sites* tab lists of all Sites connected to your domain. You can navigate to a Site by clicking on the card.
  * The *Domain Settings* tab has two sections: *Details* and *Danger*. You can edit your *DNS Provider* or delete your domain from your Organization.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-03/CloudCannon-Changelog-Domain-Page-Network-Subdomain-Tab.png" alt="A screenshot of the Subdomains section of the Network tab shows the Hosting Setup, SSL, and Site browser." title="The Domain page" type="screenshot"/>

* Clicking on a subdomain card in the *Subdomains browser* will open the *Subdomains* section of the *Network* tab.
* The *Subdomains* section allows you to configure your *Hosting Setup* and *SSL*, and also has a *Sites browser* for all Sites connected to that subdomain.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-03/CloudCannon-Changelog-Site-Settings-Custom-Domain-Page-Empty.png" alt="A screenshot of the Custom Domain page shows the Base Domain dropdown, the Domain Name and Subpath text fields, and the Add Domain button." title="The Custom Domain page" type="screenshot"/>

* The *Custom Domain* page under *Site Settings* no longer shows your hosting setup, nameserver status, or SSL settings.
  * These settings are now on your *Domain* page.
* If you don't have a domain connect to your Site, the *Custom Domain* page will allow you to connect an existing domain from your Organization, or create a domain using the *Base Domain* dropdown.
* You can also choose a subdomain or subpath to serve your Site on.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-03/CloudCannon-Changelog-Site-Settings-Custom-Domain-Page.png" alt="A screenshot of the Custom Domain page shows the current domain, the View Domain Settings button, and the Remove Custom Domain button." title="The Custom Domain page" type="screenshot"/>

* Once you have connected a domain to your Site, the *Custom Domain* page will provide a link to the *Domain* page for this domain.
* The *Remove Custom Domain* will disconnect the domain from your Site, but will not remove it from your Organization. You must disconnect a domain from all Sites before you can remove it from your Organization.
