## Features & Improvements

### Resolve Publishing Conflicts

You can now resolve Publishing Conflicts in CloudCannon.

Publishing Conflict resolution is available to the Owners, Developers, and Technical Editors [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/) and [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/) with the `site:source-editor:write` and `site:publish:upstream:write` permissions.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-03/CloudCannon-Changelog-Mar2025-Update-Publish-Branch-Popup.png" alt="A screenshot of the Update from Publish Branch notification shows this Site has four updates available and the Update this site button." title="The Update from Publish Branch notification" type="ui-snippet"/>

* When you click the *Update from Publish Branch* button on the *Publishing* page to update your Site from its Publish Branch, CloudCannon may detect a Publishing Conflict. A Publishing Conflict occurs when the version of a file incoming from your Publish Branch and the version of the same file on your current branch do not match. Previously, you had to rely on your local developer environment or Git provider to resolve these conflicts.
* When CloudCannon detects a Publishing Conflict, it will now show you a list of all files with incoming changes, including files with conflicts, on the *Publishing* page.
* When you click on the card for a conflicted file, CloudCannon will open the Source Editor and highlight the conflicted sections. CloudCannon will highlight the changes to the file from your current branch in red and the incoming changes from the Publish Branch in green.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-03/CloudCannon-Changelog-Resolve-Conflict-Source-Editor.png" alt="A screenshot of a file open in the Source Editor on the Publishing page highlights the change on the current branch and the incoming change from the Publish Branch." title="The Resolve Conflict Source Editor" type="ui-snippet"/>

* You can click on the *Use current* or *Use incoming* buttons to replace one change with another or click into the Source Editor to make a hybrid of the changes manually.
* You can quickly move to the next conflict in a large file by clicking the *Scroll to next conflict* button.
* When you have finished resolving conflicts in a file, you can click the *Mark as resolved* button to save the file.
* When you have resolved all conflicted files, click the *Update from Publish Branch* button. CloudCannon will complete the update from your Publish Branch.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-03/CloudCannon-Changelog-Publish-Button-Conflicts-Notification.png" alt="A screenshot of the Publish button shows the Conflicts warning notification in the top right." title="The Publish button" type="ui-snippet"/>

* Once CloudCannon detects a Publishing Conflict, you cannot publish to your Publish Branch or save changes to your files without addressing the conflicts.
* You can address the conflicts by resolving all conflicted files or abandoning the update attempt.
* If you resolve all conflicted files, CloudCannon will also save any unsaved changes made to your Site after the update attempt begun. If you abandon your update attempt, CloudCannon will discard all unsaved changes.
  * We do not recommend editing your files while an update attempt is in progress, unless those edits are related to a conflict.
  * To prevent CloudCannon from detecting Publishing Conflicts while you edit your Site, you cannot attempt to update from your Publish Branch while you have unsaved changes.
* After abandoning your update attempt, you can return to editing your files and saving changes. CloudCannon will remove all warnings about Publishing Conflicts. However, you must still resolve your Publishing Conflicts before you can publish changes from this Site to your Publish Branch.
* CloudCannon will remind you about any Publishing Conflicts the next time you try to publish from this Site or update from your Publish Branch.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-03/CloudCannon-Changelog-Cannot-Resolve-Conflicts-Notification.png" alt="A screenshot of the Update from Publish Branch notification shows that CloudCannon cannot resolve a Publishing Conflict." title="The Cannot Update notification" type="ui-snippet"/>

* If CloudCannon detects a Publishing Conflict that you cannot solve in the Source Editor (e.g., a conflict in an image file), a warning notification will appear on the *Publishing* page, directing you to resolve this conflict in your local developer environment.

### *Publishing* page updates

We improved the appearance and functionality of the *Publishing* page.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-03/CloudCannon-Changelog-Publishing-Page-Summary-Tab.png" alt="A screenshot of the Publishing page shows a Summary Tab, Changes Tab, and Commits Tab." title="The Publishing page" type="screenshot"/>

* The *Publishing* page now has a *Summary* tab. The *Changes* and *Commits* tabs have moved to the top of the page to be more consistent with other areas in the app.
* The *Summary* tab has three sections: the *Publish* section, *Changes* section, and *Commits* section.
  * The inputs in the *Publish* section allow you to publish your Site to its Publish Branch, or delete the Site. This section will look different depending on which publishing method you have enabled for your Site: merge changes immediately, or create a Pull Request.
  * The *Changes* section on this tab shows the total number of files with saved changes and the three most recently changed files. It also has a *See more* link to the *Changes* tab if there are more than three files with changes.
  * The *Commits* section on this tab shows the two most recent commits made on this Site. It also has a *See more* link to the *Commits* tab if there are more than two commits.
* The *Changes* tab lists all the files with saved changes on your Site.
* The *Commits* tab lists all the commits made on your Site. If you click the *View* button on a commit card, CloudCannon will open that commit's page on your Git provider's website in another tab.

### *Domains* section updates

We improved the *Domains* section of the app and consolidated custom domain settings to this section from *Site Settings*.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-03/CloudCannon-Changelog-Domains-Browser.png" alt="A screenshot of the Domains Browser shows two domains, a search bar, and a Create a Domain button." title="The Domains Browser" type="screenshot"/>

* You can access the *Domains browser* by clicking the *Domains* button in the *App sidebar*.
* The *Domains browser* shows all domains connected to your Organization. Each domain is represented by a card.
* Domain card metadata shows you the status of your domain, how many CloudCannon Sites are connected to that domain, and whether the domain uses CloudCannon or External DNS.
* The *Domains browser* now has a *\+ Create a Domain* button in the top right.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-03/CloudCannon-Changelog-Create-Domain-Page.png" alt="A screenshot of the Create a Domain page shows a text field for a Base Domain and a radio button for DNS provider." title="The Create a Domain page" type="screenshot"/>

* You can click the *\+ Create a Domain* button to open the *Create a Domain* page.
* On the *Create a Domain* page, you can enter a *Base Domain* and select a *DNS Provider* option from CloudCannon or External.
* When you click the *Create Domain* button, CloudCannon will take you to that domain's *Domain* page.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-03/CloudCannon-Changelog-Domain-Page-Network-Tab.png" alt="A screenshot of the Network tab on the Domain page shows the status of domain Nameservers, subdomains, and fallback redirect." title="The Domain page" type="screenshot"/>

* Clicking on a domain card in the *Domains browser* will also open that domain's *Domain* page.
* The *Domain* page allows you to review and manage all settings for a given domain.
* The *Domain* page has four tabs: the *Network* tab, the *DNS* tab, the *Sites* tab, and the *Domain Settings* tab.
  * The *Network* tab shows the status of your Nameservers, lists all your subdomains in a *Subdomains browser*, and shows the Fallback redirect for all unconfigured subdomains.
  * The *DNS* tab lists all DNS records configured for your domain, and includes a search bar and *Create record* button in the top right. You can edit or delete each DNS record using the *Context Menu* in the top right of the card.
  * The *Sites* tab lists of all Sites connected to your domain. You can navigate to a Site by clicking on the card.
  * The *Domain Settings* tab has two sections: *Details* and *Danger*. You can edit your *DNS Provider* or release the domain from your Organization.
* You cannot disconnect a domain from your Organization if it is connected to any Sites.
* You can now select the domain for the Fallback redirect using a dropdown, rather than a list.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-03/CloudCannon-Changelog-Domain-Page-Network-Subdomain-Tab.png" alt="A screenshot of the Subdomains section of the Network tab shows the Hosting Setup, SSL, and Site browser." title="The Domain page" type="screenshot"/>

* Clicking on a subdomain card in the *Subdomains browser* will open the *Subdomains* section of the *Network* tab.
* The *Subdomains* section allows you to configure your Hosting Setup and SSL, and also has a Sites browser for all Sites connected to that subdomain.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-03/CloudCannon-Changelog-Site-Settings-Custom-Domain-Page-Empty.png" alt="A screenshot of the Custom Domain page shows the Base Domain dropdown, the Domain Name and Subpath text fields, and the Add Domain button." title="The Custom Domain page" type="screenshot"/>

* The *Custom Domain* page under *Site Settings* no longer shows your hosting setup, nameserver status, or SSL settings.
  * These settings are now on your Domain page.
* If you don't have a domain added to your Site, the Custom Domain page will allow you to add an existing domain from your Organization, or create a domain using the *Base Domain* dropdown.
* You can also choose a subdomain or subpath to serve your Site on.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-03/CloudCannon-Changelog-Site-Settings-Custom-Domain-Page.png" alt="A screenshot of the Custom Domain page shows the current domain, the View Domain Settings button, and the Remove Custom Domain button." title="The Custom Domain page" type="screenshot"/>

* Once you have connected a domain to your Site, the *Custom Domain* page will provide a link to the *Domain* page for this domain.
* The *Remove Custom Domain* button will disconnect the domain from your Site, but will not remove it from your Organization. You must disconnect a domain from all Sites before you can remove it from your Organization.

### Source Editor updates

We have updated the engine for our Source Editor.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-03/CloudCannon-Changelog-Source-Editor-Engine-Update.png" alt="A screenshot of the Source Editor shows syntax highlighting for both YAML and markdown content." title="The Source Editor" type="screenshot"/>

* The updated Source Editor has better syntax highlighting, specifically in files with YAML front matter and markdown content.
* You can now see conflict highlighting in the Source Editor.
* Updated themes for the Source Editor. The new default theme is `basic_dark`.
* You can now edit your files on multiple lines simultaneously. Highlight a string in the Source Editor and use the `CMD+D` or `CTRL+D` keyboard shortcut to add multiple cursors at every instance of that string in the document.
* The new engine allows us to add more editing interface configuration in the future.

### *Status* page updates

We have updated the appearance and functionality of the *Recommendations* task list on the *Status* page.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-03/CloudCannon-Changelog-Status-Page-Recommendations-List.png" alt="A screenshot of the Recommendations list from the Status page shows actions for creating a Site Icon and an Initial Site Settings file." title="The Recommendations list" type="ui-snippet"/>

* You can now add a Site Icon to the root folder of your Git repository using the *Upload Site Icon* button in the *Recommendations* task list.
* You can now generate an Initial Site Settings file in the `.cloudcannon` folder of your Git repository using the *Generate initial-site-settings.json* button in the *Recommendations* task list. You can also generate this file from the *Build Configuration* page, under *Site Settings*.

### *Context Menu* file action updates

We added a new file action, *View diff*, to the file *Context Menu* in the *Collection browser* and all editing interfaces, and changed the behavior of the *Clone* file action.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-03/CloudCannon-Changelog-Content-Editor-View-Diff.png" alt="A screenshot of the Content Editor shows the View Diffs pop-up window with unsaved changes to the file highlighted in red and green." title="The Content Editor" type="screenshot"/>

* The *View diff* file action in the *Context Menu* allows you to review the unsaved changes to a file in text format.
* CloudCannon will highlight deleted content in red, added content in green, and mixed content in yellow.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-03/CloudCannon-Changelog-Content-Editor-Context-Menu.png" alt="A screenshot of the Context Menu in the Content Editor shows file actions for View diff and Duplicate." title="The file Context Menu" type="ui-snippet"/>

* Before this release, the *Clone* file action in the *Context Menu* would create an exact copy of the file, including any [instance values](/documentation/articles/configure-your-inputs/#instance_value) in inputs. This behavior was often undesired as multiple files would have the same UUID or the date would not reflect the time the file was created.
* The *Clone* file action is now called *Duplicate* and generates new values for instance values.

### Other features & improvements

* Conflicting updates have been renamed to Syncing paused to better reflect the app state.
* We have removed the Conflicting updates notification in the *Site Navigation* and replaced it with the *Syncing paused* warning notification over the *Save* button. This appearance is now consistent with Publishing Conflicts.
* Color inputs now support alpha for Hex values.
* Added the `icon_background_color` configuration key for `preview`, `preview.metadata[*]`, and `preview.gallery`. This key allows you to specify a background color for icons, in case the value for `icon_color` is not visible against the white background of the app.
* Added the `background_color` configuration key for `preview.gallery`. This key allows you to specify a background color for the gallery section of a card when displaying an icon, in case the value for `icon_color` is not visible against the white background of the app.
* Updated messaging on the *Build Pending* page.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue where, when configuring Snippets, CloudCannon incorrectly required you to define the `view` key within the `preview` object. You now configure the `view` key directly inside the Snippet.
* Fixed an issue where, when you selected a new method on the *Authentication* page, CloudCannon would display the inputs for a new Authentication method incorrectly before you confirmed your choice.
* Fixed an issue where Color inputs would incorrectly display the color preview for HSV colors.
* Fixed an issue where you could not close the color picker in a Color input by pressing the tab key.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, CloudCannon would incorrectly enable alpha for Color inputs.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon failed to convert existing color values to the correct format.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, you could not clear the value of an Image input in the Content Editor.
* Fixed an issue where the gallery preview on an Image in rich text would disappear on click or drag.
* Fixed an issue where you could not rename a new file using the *Context Menu* in the Content Editor immediately after you created the file.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, the CloudCannon would display a broken image as the Site Icon.
* Fixed an issue where, when you tried to select an image for an Image input, gallery previews on the cards in the *Files* model would not display correctly.
* Fixed an issue where opening the CloudCannon Configuration File using the *Edit your configuration file* button on the *Status* page resulted in incorrect behavior.
* Fixed an issue where dragging a file to the top or bottom of the *Collection browser* or *File browser* would not cause the page to scroll.
