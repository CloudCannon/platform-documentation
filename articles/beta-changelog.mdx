## Features & Improvements

### Resolve publishing conflicts

You can now resolve publishing conflicts in CloudCannon.

* When you click the *Update this site* button on the *Publishing* page to update your Site from its Publish Branch, CloudCannon may detect a publishing conflict. A publishing conflict occurs when the version of a file incoming from your Publish Branch and the version of the same file on your current branch do not match. Previously, you had to rely on your local developer environment or Git provider to resolve these conflicts.
* The *Publishing* page will show you a list of all files with incoming changes, including files with conflicts.
* When you click on the card for a conflicted file, CloudCannon will open the Source Editor and highlight the conflicted sections. CloudCannon will highlight the changes in the file from your current branch in red and the incoming changes from the Publish Branch in green.

* You can click on the *Use current* or *Use incoming* buttons to replace one change with another or click into the *Source Editor* to make a hybrid of the changes manually.
* You can quickly move to the next conflict in a large file by clicking the *Scroll to next conflict* button.
* When you have finished resolving conflicts in a file, you can click the *Mark resolved* button to save the file.
* When you have resolved all conflicted files, click the *Save all resolved files* button. CloudCannon will complete the update from your Publish Branch.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-03/CloudCannon-Changelog-Publish-Button-Conflicts-Notification.png" alt="A screenshot of the Publish button shows the Conflicts warning notification in the top right." title="The Publish button" type="ui-snippet"/>

* Once CloudCannon detects a publishing conflict, you cannot publish to your Publish Branch or save changes to your files.
* You must resolve the publishing conflict and update your Site from its Publish Branch or abandon the update attempt.
* If you resolve all publishing conflicts, CloudCannon will also save any unsaved changes made to your Site after the update attempt has begun. If you abandon your update attempt, CloudCannon will discard all unsaved changes.
  * We do not recommend editing your files while an update attempt is in progress. To prevent CloudCannon from detecting publishing conflicts while editing your Site, you cannot attempt to update from your Publish branch while you have unsaved changes.
* After abandoning your update attempt, you can return to editing your files and saving changes. CloudCannon will remove all warnings about publishing conflicts. However, you must still resolve your publishing conflicts before publishing from this Site to your Publish Branch.
* CloudCannon will remind you about any publishing conflicts the next time you try to publish from this Site or update from your Publish Branch.

* If CloudCannon detects a publishing conflict that you cannot solve in the *Source Editor* (e.g., a conflict in an image file), a warning notification will appear on the *Publishing* page, directing you to resolve this conflict in your local developer environment.
