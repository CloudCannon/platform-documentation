## Editing interface improvements

* You don’t have to worry about losing your unsaved changes. CloudCannon now periodically updates as you make changes, so you can refresh your internet browser, change the editing interface, and switch who is editing your file without losing any content. The *Updating* indicator in the top right of any editing interface will show when the last update occurred.
* You can now participate in editing sessions with your team members. During an editing session, one person can edit while multiple people view their edits live. You can switch between&nbsp;*Editing*&nbsp;and&nbsp;*Viewing*&nbsp;with the dropdown in the top right of the editing interface.
  * While in *Viewing* mode, you can interact with the file in read-only mode.
  * Avatars in the top right will indicate who is *Editing* or *Viewing* a file.
* All team members now share an editing environment. This prevents one team member from unknowingly destroying other people’s unsaved changes when editing the same file.
* You can now open newly created files in the Source Editor without the need to save your site.
* The *Data panel* for editing images and links in the Visual Editor is now consistent with the *Data panel* for editing snippets.
* When opening files in the Visual Editor, the sidebar now defaults to Open/Closed, depending on the last file you had open.
* Fixed an issue where typing in a text input in the sidebar of the Content or Visual Editor would cause image inputs to re-render.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon CSS interfered with site elements in the Visual Editor.

## Rich text editor overhaul

* We have overhauled the appearance and functionality of the rich text editor.
* Updated the icons in the *WYSIWYG toolbar* for the Content Editor and other rich text fields. This will improve clarity and consistency with other icons in CloudCannon.
* We have improved the reliability of the *Undo* and *Redo* toolbar options and keyboard shortcuts.
* The Code tool has been split into `code_inline` and `code_block` toolbar options. Enabling `code` in your toolbar options under your global configuration file enables both toolbar options.
* You can now add inline Snippets.
* Images in the rich text editor now behave like Snippets.
* When you paste an image into the rich text editor, a loading icon will appear while the image uploads.
* Better controls for tables in the rich text editor.
* We have updated the pop-up window for links and Snippets.
* Fixed an issue where undoing a Snippet in the rich text view incorrectly added HTML to the file.
* Fixed an issue where image Snippets would not display an image preview in some Hugo sites.
* Fixed an issue where, in some cases, the rich text input field would not display its content.

## Avatars

* Avatars for you and your team members now appear in various places throughout the app. Avatars appear on file cards and folders, in the *Site navigation*, and the top right of an editing interface.
* Avatars will appear when a team member is online and will move to indicate what sites or files they are interacting with in real time.
* Clicking on an avatar will open the *Avatar card*, showing that team member’s name, profile image, email address, and a list of files they have open. Files they are *Viewing* are marked with an eye icon. Files they are *Editing* are marked with a pencil icon. You can navigate to those files by clicking on the file name in the avatar card.
  * Client avatars have a list of open files but no name, profile image, or email address.
* Avatars will also appear in the *Review changes* modal. In the *Review changes* modal, the avatar indicates that a team member contributed to the unsaved changes in this file. This avatar does not show whether a team member is online, or what files they have open.

## Workflow updates

* The process for uploading, moving, renaming, and deleting files is now consistent with Git workflows. Selecting *Upload*, *Move*, *Rename*, or *Delete* no longer immediately performs that action. Instead, the file or folder will be marked, and that action will occur the next time you save your changes. Marked files will receive a *New*, *Edited*, or *Deleted* badge to indicate they have unsaved changes.
* You can now move, clone, rename, or delete a file or folder by selecting that option in the *Context menu* at the top right of the file/folder card or from the *Context menu* at the top right of any editing interface.
* Renamed files will appear in your browser twice. The file with the new name will have a *New* badge, and the file with the old name will have a *Deleted* badge.
* Deleting files or folders:
  * You can open files marked for deletion in read-only mode. Opening a deleted file will show the “This file has been deleted” banner across the bottom of the editing interface.
  * You can restore files or folders marked for deletion any time before you save your changes. To restore a file or folder, select the *Restore file/folder* option in the *Context menu* at the top right of the file/folder card or from the *Context menu* at the top right of any editing interface. You can also click the *Restore file* button in the *Deleted file banner* at the bottom of any editing interface.

## *Review changes* modal improvements

* You now have more control over the way you review your unsaved changes.
* Each file with unsaved changes appears as a file card in the *Review changes* modal. Each card shows the title, collection (if applicable), filename, avatars for each team member who contributed to unsaved changes, and when the file was last updated. The file card will also show a *New*, *Edited*, or *Deleted* badge to summarize the unsaved changes to that file.
* Files with unsaved changes are grouped into three headings: *My changes*, *Other changes*, and *Conflicting updates*.
  * The *My changes* heading lists all the files where you contributed to unsaved changes. These files are selected by default when you open the *Review changes* modal.
  * The *Other changes* heading lists all the files where you have not contributed to unsaved changes.
  * In some cases, you may see a *Conflicting updates* heading. This heading lists files with updates from outside of CloudCannon that conflict with your unsaved changes. You must address these conflicting updates to save other changes. You can address these conflicting updates by saving the affected files to attempt a merge or by discarding unsaved changes for those files.

## Conflicting changes

* CloudCannon now detects and blocks incoming changes that conflict with your unsaved changes. This will prevent your save from replacing any updates from an external source (i.e., race condition).
* You will be notified when your site has *Conflicting changes* via a warning message in your *Site navigation* and *Review changes* modal. You can address these *Conflicting changes* by saving the affected files to attempt a merge or by discarding unsaved changes for those files to remove the conflict.

## Badge improvements

* Three badge types appear on file and folder cards, indicating unsaved changes. These badges are *New*, *Edited*, and *Deleted.* These badges are removed from cards once all changes have been saved.
* The *Edited* badge indicates a file’s content has been updated or files within a folder have been added, edited, or marked for deletion. The *Edited* badge will also appear on cards on the *Sites list* page when there are unsaved changes for that site.
* The *New* badge indicates a file or folder was recently created or that all files within a folder were recently created.
* The *Deleted* badge indicates a file or folder has been marked for deletion or that all files within a folder have been marked for deletion.
* Fixed an issue where the *Edited* badge would persist after all changes were saved.

## *Account menu* and *Context menu* improvements

* The *Account menu* now has an option for *Organizations*. We have also renamed *My Account* to *Account Settings* and removed the header displaying your current organization.
* The *Context menu* in the top right of a file card and the *Context menu* in the top right of the editing interface are now consistent. Both menus now include the *Publish to posts* (Jekyll only), *Move*, *Clone*, *Rename*, *Download*, *Discard unsaved changes*, and *Delete* file actions.

## *Editing help* modal

* An *Editing help* modal will now appear in CloudCannon’s editing interfaces. This modal contains helpful information about how to use the *Editing interface navigation*.
* You will see this modal when you open an editing interface for the first time or when a new feature is released for our editing interfaces.
* You can reopen the modal any time using the ⓘ icon in the top right of any editing interface.

## Accessibility improvements

* We have improved app navigation using keyboard inputs.
* You can now navigate the&nbsp;*Context menu*&nbsp;using your keyboard's arrow, tab, and escape keys.

## UI improvements

* Radio buttons now have a clearer color scheme to indicate selected, unselected, disabled selected, and disabled unselected states.
* Improved the appearance of all modals in CloudCannon.
