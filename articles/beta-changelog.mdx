## Features & Improvements

### Resolve publishing conflicts

You can now resolve publishing conflict in CloudCannon.

* When you click the *Update this site* button on the *Publishing* page to update your Site from its Publish Branch, CloudCannon may detect a publishing conflict. A publishing conflict occurs when the version of a file incoming from your Publish Branch and the version of the same file on your current branch don't match. Previously, you had to rely on your local developer environment or Git provider to resolve these conflicts.
