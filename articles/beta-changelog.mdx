## Features & Improvements

### Resolve publishing conflicts

You can now resolve publishing conflicts in CloudCannon.

* When you click the *Update this site* button on the *Publishing* page to update your Site from its Publish Branch, CloudCannon may detect a publishing conflict. A publishing conflict occurs when the version of a file incoming from your Publish Branch and the version of the same file on your current branch don't match. Previously, you had to rely on your local developer environment or Git provider to resolve these conflicts.
* The *Publishing* page will show you a list of all files with incoming changes, including files with conflicts.
* When you click on the card for a conflicted file, CloudCannon will open the Source Editor and highlight the conflicted sections. The changes in the file from your current branch are highlighted in red, and the incoming changes from the Publish Branch are highlighted in green.

* You can click on the *Use current* or *Use incoming* buttons to replace one change with another, or click into the *Source Editor* to make a hybrid of the changes manually.
* You can quickly move to the next conflict in a large file by clicking the *Scroll to next conflict* button.
* When you have finished resolving conflicts in a file, you can click the *Mark resolved* button to save the file.
* When you have resolved all conflicted files, click the *Save all resolved files* button. CloudCannon will complete the update from your Publish Branch.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/change-log/2025-03/CloudCannon-Changelog-Cannot-Resolve-Conflicts-Notification.png" alt="A screenshot of the Update from Publish Branch notification shows that CloudCannon cannot resolve a publishing conflict." title="The Cannot Update notification" type="ui-snippet"/>

* If CloudCannon detects a publishing conflict that cannot be solved in the *Source Editor* (e.g., a conflict in an image file), a warning notification will appear on the *Publishing* page, directing you to resolve this conflict in your local developer environment.
