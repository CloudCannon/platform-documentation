2. Click **Authenticate a new DAM**
3. Select your provider from the dropdown, then fill out the relevant fields. Check your provider's documentation to see where you can find the relevant values
4. Click **Authenticate**.

You will then be able to manage your DAM within the scope of your organisation. To check the authentication went correctly:

2. Locate the relevant DAM, and click the **Manage** button next to its name
3. In the **Configuration tab**, click the **Open preview** button.

If your DAM successfully authenticated, a modal will open that will let your browse the files in your DAM. If something goes wrong, you may have entered your details incorrectly. Read below to learn how to configure an existing DAM with CloudCannon.
