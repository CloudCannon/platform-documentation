A File input is an editing interface for file paths, allowing you to upload a file to your repository or [DAM](/documentation/articles/integrating-your-dam-with-cloudcannon/), or add links to external files. You can use this input in the Data Editor, Content Editor, or Visual Editor to edit structured data in data files or front matter.

There are three types of File input:

* File
* Document
* Image

## File input types

### File

The File input provides an editing interface for uploading files to your repository or DAM and browsing existing assets.

### Document

The Document input provides an editing interface for uploading documents to your repository or DAM and browsing existing assets. By default, this input only accepts document file types.

### Image

The Image input provides an editing interface for uploading images to your repository or DAM and browsing existing assets. By default, this input only accepts image file types.

## File input appearance and behavior

Depending on how your developer configured the input, your File input may have different options for uploading and browsing files. You can upload files directly to your repository or to a connected DAM.

Your File input may also have input validation, which requires the value to match predefined criteria before you can save your changes.

CloudCannon will show a red `*` next to the name of your File input if a value is required.

If you enter a file that exceeds the maximum file size limit, CloudCannon will display an error message in red text under the input field.

If your developer has configured a pattern for your input value (such as specific file extensions), CloudCannon will warn you when the value does not match the pattern. CloudCannon will show any error messages underneath the input field in red.

For more information, please read our developer documentation on [configuring a File input](/documentation/articles/configure-a-file-input/) for configuration options, valid input values, and unconfigured input behavior.

## Misconfigured File inputs

You will see an orange warning box if your File input is misconfigured.

File inputs are misconfigured if:
* The configured upload path does not exist in your repository
* The configured MIME types are invalid
* The configured DAM source is not connected to your site

For more information on how to fix a misconfigured File input, please read our developer documentation on [configuring a File input](/documentation/articles/configure-a-file-input/).
