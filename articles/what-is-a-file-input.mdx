A File input is an editing interface for file paths, allowing you to upload a file to your repository or [DAM](/documentation/articles/integrating-your-dam-with-cloudcannon/), select a previously uploaded file, or add a link to an external file. You can use this input in the Data Editor, Content Editor, or Visual Editor to edit structured data in data files or front matter.

There are three types of File input:

* File
* Document
* Image

## File input types

### File

The File input provides an editing interface for uploading files to your repository or DAM and browsing existing assets.

You can upload a file by dragging and dropping it from your local storage over the File input, or by clicking the + button at the top right of the input and selecting the *Upload a new file* option. CloudCannon will upload your file to your repository or [DAM](/documentation/articles/integrating-your-dam-with-cloudcannon/).

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

Alternatively, you can select an existing file by selecting the Select existing files option. CloudCannon will open the *Files browser* to the upload folder in your repository or [DAM](/documentation/articles/integrating-your-dam-with-cloudcannon/).

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

When a file is selected, the File input will display a preview of the image if it is an image file, or metadata if it is a document file.

You can edit the file path by typing in the text field. To clear the selected file, you can click the *Clear* button at the top right of the input.

### Document

The Document input provides an editing interface for uploading document files to your repository or DAM and browsing existing assets.

You can upload a file by dragging and dropping it from your local storage over the File input. You can also click the + button at the top right of the input and select the *Upload a new file* option. CloudCannon will upload your file to your repository or [DAM](/documentation/articles/integrating-your-dam-with-cloudcannon/).

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

Alternatively, you can select an existing file by selecting the Select existing files option. CloudCannon will open the *Files browser* to the upload folder in your repository or [DAM](/documentation/articles/integrating-your-dam-with-cloudcannon/).

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

When a file is selected, the Document input will display metadata for the document file.

You can edit the file path by typing in the text field. To clear the selected file, you can click the *Clear* button at the top right of the input.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

### Image

The Image input provides an editing interface for uploading image files to your repository or DAM and browsing existing assets.

You can upload a file by dragging and dropping it from your local storage over the Image input. You can also click the + button at the top right of the input and select the *Upload a new file* option. CloudCannon will upload your file to your repository or [DAM](/documentation/articles/integrating-your-dam-with-cloudcannon/).

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

Alternatively, you can select an existing file by selecting the Select existing files option. CloudCannon will open the *Files browser* to the upload folder in your repository or [DAM](/documentation/articles/integrating-your-dam-with-cloudcannon/).

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

When a file is selected, the Image input will display a preview of the image file.

You can edit the file path by typing in the text field. To clear the selected file, you can click the *Clear* button at the top right of the input.

## File input appearance and behavior

Depending on how your developer configured the input, your File input may have different options for uploading and browsing files. You can upload files directly to your repository or to a connected DAM.

### Input validation

Your File input may also have input validation, which requires the value to match predefined criteria before you can save your changes.

CloudCannon will show a red `*` next to the name of your File input if a value is required.

If you enter a file that exceeds the maximum file size limit, CloudCannon will display an error message in red text under the input field.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

If your developer has configured a pattern for your input value (such as specific file extensions), CloudCannon will warn you when the value does not match the pattern. CloudCannon will show any error messages underneath the input field in red.

For more information, please read our developer documentation on [configuring a File input](/documentation/articles/configure-a-file-input/) for configuration options, valid input values, and unconfigured input behavior.

## Misconfigured File inputs

You will see an orange warning box if your File input is misconfigured.

File inputs are misconfigured if:

* The configured upload path does not exist in your repository
* The configured MIME types are invalid
* The configured DAM source is not connected to your site

For more information on how to fix a misconfigured File input, please read our developer documentation on [configuring a File input](/documentation/articles/configure-a-file-input/).
