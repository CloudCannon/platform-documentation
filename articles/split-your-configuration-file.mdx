## Common errors

### Configuration not loading

* Check that your glob patterns match the actual file paths
* Ensure files are relative to the repository root (not the `source` directory)
* Verify you're using Unified configuration

### Unexpected overwrites

* Remember that object keys in globbed files overwrite main config values
* Check the order of your glob patterns - later files overwrite earlier ones
* Review which keys are being defined in multiple files

### Array items missing

* Array items are appended, not merged - ensure all items are present in your globbed files
* Check that your glob patterns are matching all intended files
