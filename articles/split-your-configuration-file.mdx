1. **Start small**: Begin by splitting one section (e.g., `_inputs`) to get familiar with the feature
2. **Test thoroughly**: After splitting, test your site to ensure everything works as expected
3. **Iterate**: Gradually split more sections as you become comfortable with the feature

These instructions assume your *Site* uses [Unified Configuration](/documentation/guides/unified-configuration-migration-guide/)...

To split your *CloudCannon Configuration File*:

1. Navigate to your *File Browser* and open your *CloudCannon Configuration File* in the Source Editor, or open it in your local development environment.
2. Identify the section of your configuration you want to split out into a new file (e.g., a *Collection*).
3. Copy all the configuration content under the key to a new file with the appropriate `.cloudcannon.[].yml` file extension.
4. Reference the

## Allowed configuration options

CloudCannon allows you to split the following configuration keys into separate *Configuration Files*.

<table><thead><tr><th><p></p></th><th><p></p></th><th><p></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td></tr><tr><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td></tr><tr><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td></tr><tr><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td><td><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

* Use `collections_config_from_glob` where you would normally use `collections_config` to point to a file with the extension `.cloudcannon.collections.yml`
* Use `schemas_from_glob` where you would normally use `schemas` to point to a file with the extension `.cloudcannon.schemas.yml`
* Use `_inputs_from_glob` where you would normally use `_inputs` to point to a file with the extension `.cloudcannon.inputs.yml`
* Use `_structures_from_glob` where you would normally use `_structures` to point to a file with the extension `.cloudcannon.structures.yml`
* Use `values_from_glob` where you would normally use `_structures.*.values` to point to a file with the extension `.cloudcannon.structures-value.yml`
* Use `_snippets_from_glob` where you would normally use `_snippets` to point to a file with the extension `.cloudcannon.snippets.yml`
* Use `_snippets_templates_from_glob` where you would normally use `_snippets_templates` to point to a file with the extension `.cloudcannon.snippets.yml`
* Use `_snippets_imports_from_glob` where you would normally use `_snippets_imports` to point to a file with the extension `cloudcannon.snippets-imports.yml`
* Use `_snippets_definitions_from_glob` where you would normally use `_snippets_definitions` to point to a file with the extension `.cloudcannon.snippets-definitions.yml`
* Use `_editables_from_glob` where you would normally use `_editables` to point to a file with the extension `.cloudcannon.editables.yml`

## Common errors

## Make sure your key and file extension match

**Use consistent naming**: Follow the recommended naming convention (`.cloudcannon.{section}.yml`) for better tooling support

For clashing object entries, globbed files overwrite the base config, and globbed entries overwrite themselves in import order

### Configuration not loading

* Check that your glob patterns match the actual file paths
* Ensure files are relative to the repository root (not the `source` directory)
* Verify you're using Unified configuration

### Unexpected overwrites

* Remember that object keys in globbed files overwrite main config values
* Check the order of your glob patterns - later files overwrite earlier ones
* Review which keys are being defined in multiple files

### Array items missing

* Array items are appended, not merged - ensure all items are present in your globbed files
* Check that your glob patterns are matching all intended files
