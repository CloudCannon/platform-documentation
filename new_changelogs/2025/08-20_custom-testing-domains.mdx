title: Custom Testing Domains
---
This release added custom Testing Domains and the `hide_link_to_telephone` key to URL inputs.

It also addressed an issue causing the browser to freeze.

### Features & Improvements

* Added custom [Testing Domains](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-testing-domain/) for the [Team and Enterprise plans](/pricing/) and members of our [Partner Program](/partner-program/). Custom Testing Domain lets you choose the domain name for your `.cloudvent.net` URL by setting a unique Organization handle for all Testing Domains and entering a unique prefix whenever you create a new Site.
  * Please get in touch with our [support team](/suppport/) if you would like a custom Testing Domain.
* Added the capacity to link to a phone number using a URL input, which prepends the value of the input with `tel:`.
  * You can hide this option using the new `hide_link_to_telephone` key when configuring URL inputs. By default, this key is `false`, except on Sites created before 20 August 2025, where the value is true. This will preserve existing behavior preferences.

### Fixes

* Fixed an issue causing the browser to freeze.
