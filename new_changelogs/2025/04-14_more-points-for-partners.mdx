title: More points for partners
---
This release added extra points for members of the [CloudCannon Partner Program](/partner-program/), and improved the messaging around Transfers, including what information CloudCannon sends with the transfer request.

## Features & Improvements

* If you are a member of the [CloudCannon Partner Program](/partner-program/), you can now earn extra points based on your [pricing plan](/pricing/) and the number of additional seats you pay for (including users and client sharing).
* Added better messaging for Transfers, such as indicating which additional resources CloudCannon will also include in the transfer (i.e., Sites, Domains, Inboxes, or DAMs) are connected to the resource you selected.
* Transfers now include the Site name, and any connected Domain, Inbox, or DAM names.

## Fixes

* Updated dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
