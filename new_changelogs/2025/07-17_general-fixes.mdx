This release improved the UI on the *Subscription* page.

It also addressed several issues affecting upload paths, cropping images from a DAM, and Fast Branch.

### Features & Improvements

* The *Subscription* page under *Org Settings* now sums all account credits into a single line on your *Estimated bill* table.

### Fixes

* Fixed an issue where some input previews did not work when using a relative path.
* Fixed an issue where CloudCannon would fail to load an image from a DAM in the *Crop image* modal.
* Fixed an issue where Fast Branch was failing, causing newly branched Sites to fail to load.
* Fixed an issue where Sites using Unified Configuration could become stuck in a loading state after branching.
