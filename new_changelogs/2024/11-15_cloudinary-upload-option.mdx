title: Cloudinary upload option
---
This release added a new option for uploading to Cloudinary. It also addressed several issues, including legacy sites saving collection select values incorrectly, and missing borders on merged table cells.

## Features & Improvements

* Added a new option **Use upload preset to determine upload location** in the site-level settings for Cloudinary DAMs. If this is turned on, your chosen Cloudinary upload preset will determine the location of all uploads to the DAM from that site. This option should be disabled if you want to use the `paths.dam_uploads` configuration option, or to allow editors to choose which subfolder an upload is saved to in the DAM.

## Fixes

* Fixed an issue causing the wrong value to be saved, when using a collection select field with the Legacy Collections Value Key site flag.
* Added redirects for some legacy template links.
* Fixed missing borders on merged table cells.
