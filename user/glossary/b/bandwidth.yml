term_description: >-
  The amount of data transferred from your website to a visitor's browser. The amount of bandwidth you use each month is determined by how many visitors your website receives and the size (in Kb or Mb) of your webpages. When you host your *Site* on CloudCannon, each pricing plan includes a specific amount of hosting bandwidth, with options to purchase additional bandwidth if needed. You can review your bandwidth usage under the *Usage* tab of your *Site Dashboard* or *Organization Home* page.
