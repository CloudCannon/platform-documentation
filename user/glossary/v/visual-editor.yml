  CloudCannon's visual editing interface provides a user-friendly way of updating your website files on an interactive preview of your webpage. You can navigate around your website preview using links/buttons, as you would on the live version, and edit your content inline on the page, or with the data panel or sidebar. What you see in the *Visual Editor* is what your website visitors will see on your live webpages.
