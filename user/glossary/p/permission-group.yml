  A group that defines what permissions team members have in CloudCannon. *Permission Groups* allow you to make *Resources* available to your team members and define what actions are allowed (Read, Write, or Create) for each resource. CloudCannon provides several *Default Permission Groups* (*Owners*, *Developers*, *Technical Editors*, *Editors*, and *Billing*) and you can create *Custom Permission Groups* for more granular control.
