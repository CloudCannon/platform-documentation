term_description: >-
  The process of verifying a user's identity. When you host your *Site* on CloudCannon, you can enable an authentication method to control who is allowed to see the live content of your website. CloudCannon supports three authentication methods: password authentication, user account authentication, and SAML authentication. By default, these authentication methods affect every page on your *Site*, but you can require authentication for specific pages using authenticated routes.
