term_description: >-
  A CloudCannon feature that allows you to invite an existing *Team Member* from within your *Organization* to view, edit, and publish content for a specific *Site*. With *Site Sharing*, you can control what a team member can interact with by limiting access to individual *Sites* rather than all *Sites* in your *Organization*. This is distinct from *Client Sharing*, which is used to invite external clients who don't have CloudCannon accounts.
