term_description: >-
  An abbreviation of Single Sign-On/Security Assertion Markup Language, SSO/SAML is an authentication method that allows users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials. CloudCannon supports SSO/SAML for *Enterprise Plan* customers. With SSO/SAML, rather than logging in to CloudCannon directly, CloudCannon authenticates the user's identity using their *Identity Provider* software.
