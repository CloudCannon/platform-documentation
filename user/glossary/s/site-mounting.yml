glossary_term_name: Site Mounting
term_description: >-
  A CloudCannon feature that makes one *Site* dependent on one or more other *Sites*. Files from a remote *Site* will be accessible to the local *Site* at build time, and any updates to the remote *Site* will trigger a build of the local *Site*. *Site Mounting* is an alternative to relying on Git submodules, build hooks, or custom APIs to manage your site dependencies.
