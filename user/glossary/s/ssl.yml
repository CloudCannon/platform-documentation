  An abbreviation for Secure Sockets Layer, SSL is a cryptographic protocol that provides secure communication over a computer network, commonly used for website security. An SSL certificate (or TLS certificate) is a periodically regenerated digital certificate that supports your website's authenticity and enables encryption for greater security between your web server and the visitor's browser. SSL certification prevents others from intercepting information, helps users distinguish between real and fake versions of your website, and verifies ownership. Websites with a valid SSL certificate use HTTPS instead of HTTP.
