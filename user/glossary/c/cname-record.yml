glossary_term_name: CNAME Record
term_description: >-
  An abbreviation of Canonical Name Record, a CNAME Record is a type of DNS record that specifies the canonical *Domain Name* for an alias *Domain Name*. When a DNS resolver finds a CNAME, it performs another lookup on the target domain to get the final IP address. This is often used to point subdomains to the IP address of a different domain name (e.g., www.example.com to example.com).
