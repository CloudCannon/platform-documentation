term_description: >-
  A CloudCannon feature that allows you to invite someone from outside your *Organization* to view, edit, and publish content for a specific *Site*. Unlike *Site Sharing*, clients invited through *Client Sharing* do not need a CloudCannon account. Instead, they log in using a site-specific password through a dedicated *Client Login Page*. *Clients* count towards team members for billing purposes.
