CloudCannon keeps a record of your billing history in the form of invoices. You can add your billing details to invoices and set your invoices to email automatically.

#### Accessing your invoices

You can access a complete list of all your invoices for your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/o/organization.yml">Organization</comp.GlossaryTerm> by heading to *Organization Settings &gt; Invoices*. From here, you can access a PDF file for each invoice by clicking **Download**.

### Configuring your invoices

#### Billing details on invoices

Add your billing details, such as your physical address, to your invoices by updating your  *Billing Contacts*. These will display on the top of your invoices. We won't mail copies to your physical address.

#### Automatically emailing invoices

By default, invoices won't automatically send to any email address. You can configure this by adding an email to your *Billing Contacts* in your *Subscription*  settings. Once set, you will see confirmation of the email address and the next expected invoice date in your *Billing* section.

#### How to update your Billing Contacts

1. Head to *Organization Settings &gt; Subscription*.
2. Under the *Billing* section, click **Update Contacts**.
3. Add your preferred email address in the top field.
4. Add your billing details in the bottom field.
5. Click **Update Billing Contacts** to save.
