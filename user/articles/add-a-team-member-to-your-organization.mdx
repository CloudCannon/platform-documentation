CloudCannon will send an email to your pending team members, inviting them to your Organization. If someone does not have a CloudCannon account, this email will prompt them to create one. While you wait for them to accept the invitation, their name will appear in the list of *Pending members* under the *Members* tab of the *Team* page.

If you need to re-send or cancel an invitation to a pending member, select the *Re-send invitation* or *Cancel invitation* options from the *Context menu* at the top right of the member card.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  You can paste a list of email addresses into the *Invite team members to your Organization* modal to quickly add multiple members to your Organization. When you enter multiple team members and multiple Permission Groups, CloudCannon will add all members to all Groups.
