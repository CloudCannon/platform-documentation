The CloudCannon User Interface is where you manage your website content. Whether you are editing a blog post, adding a new staff member to your "About Us" page, or browsing your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/f/file.yml">files</comp.GlossaryTerm>, familiarizing yourself with the CloudCannon interface will help you work efficiently.

This section provides a tour of the CloudCannon app. You will learn what different elements are called, where to find specific tools, and how to navigate between your content. These articles are a great place to start for new Users, or to return to when you see an element referenced in another article.

In the CloudCannon UI section of our User documentation, we cover:

* Sites — Learn how CloudCannon organizes your website(s)
* Browsers — Learn how to find your website content on a *Site* in CloudCannon
* Editing Interfaces — Learn about CloudCannon's editing interfaces for updating your website content

Let's briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## Sites

Sites are the main way CloudCannon organizes your content. Each Site connects to a branch of your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/g/git-repository.yml">Git repository</comp.GlossaryTerm>. The Site header at the top of the screen shows which Site you are viewing and provides access to Site settings.

For a more in-depth explanation of the Site interface, please read our documentation:

* What is a Site?
* [What is the Site Header?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-site-header/)
* [What is the Site Navigation?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-site-navigation/)

## Browsers

Browsers in CloudCannon let you find, browse, sort, and open your website files. There are two main types of browsers: the *Collection Browser* for viewing collections of related content (like all your blog posts or all your product pages), and the File Browser for viewing your files by their location in your website's folder structure.

For a more in-depth explanation of these browsers, please read our documentation:

* What is the Collection Browser?
* [What is the File Browser?](/documentation/user-articles/the-file-browser/)

## Editing Interfaces

CloudCannon offers four editing interfaces: the <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/v/visual-editor.yml">Visual Editor</comp.GlossaryTerm>, <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/c/content-editor.yml">Content Editor</comp.GlossaryTerm>, <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/d/data-editor.yml">Data Editor</comp.GlossaryTerm>, and <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/source-editor.yml">Source Editor</comp.GlossaryTerm>. Each provides a different way to edit your content. The Visual Editor lets you click directly on your page; the Content Editor is a rich text editor; the Data Editor shows structured fields; and the Source Editor shows the raw file.

For a more in-depth explanation of the editing interfaces, please read our documentation:

* What is an Editing Interface?
* [What is the Visual Editor?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-visual-editor/)
* [What is the Content Editor?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-content-editor/)
* [What is the Data Editor?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-data-editor/)
* [What is the Source Editor?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-source-editor/)

## Editing interfaces

CloudCannon has four editing interfaces: the Visual Editor, Content Editor, Data Editor, and Source Editor. Each interface provides a different editing experience, with tools specific to particular file types. Most of these interfaces are available to all SSGs. However, we don’t support the Visual Editor for some documentation-based SSGs.

The Visual Editor is an interactive preview of your site. Your team can navigate each page by clicking links as you would on the live site and edit by clicking directly on the content. Developers can determine which page elements are editable and configure the Visual Editor sidebar to alter a file’s front matter. The Visual Editor removes the guesswork of updating your content by showing you exactly what your live site will look like in a true WYSIWYG experience.

The Content Editor is a rich text editor useful for markup and combination files. This editor provides a clean, distraction-free interface for editing content-heavy files like blog posts. Customize your WYSIWYG toolbar to include the tools your content team needs, add Snippets to create a library of custom content blocks, and use the sidebar to edit front matter content — all in the same editor.

The Data Editor is a simple interface for managing structured data. Team members can edit [Inputs](/documentation/user-articles/what-are-inputs/) values without being overwhelmed by code syntax. CloudCannon uses the Data Editor in the Visual and Content Editors, where it functions as the sidebar to manage front matter content.

The Source Editor is an in-browser code editor that is great for making minor changes to any of your files. CloudCannon automatically applies syntax highlighting to your files based on the file extension. This editing interface does not require configuration and will work out of the box for any SSG. This editing interface is available to users with Owners, Developers, and Technical Editors [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/user-articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/).

For a more in-depth explanation of our editing interfaces, including how to configure each interface and customize the default editor for a given Collection or Schema, read our documentation:

* [The Content Editor](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-content-editor/)
* [The Data Editor](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-data-editor/)
* [The Source Editor](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-source-editor/)
