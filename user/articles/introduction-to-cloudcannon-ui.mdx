The CloudCannon User Interface is where you manage your website content. Whether you are editing a blog post, adding a new <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/t/team-member.yml">team member</comp.GlossaryTerm> to a page, or browsing your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/f/file.yml">files</comp.GlossaryTerm>, familiarizing yourself with the interface will help you work efficiently.

This section provides a tour of the CloudCannon app. You will learn what different elements are called, where to find specific tools, and how to navigate between your content. These articles are a great place to start for new Users, or to return to when you see an element referenced in another article.

In the CloudCannon UI section of our documentation, we cover:

* [Sites](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-site-header/) — learn about the Site header, navigation, and how to switch between Sites.
* [The Site Header](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-site-header/) — the top bar that shows your Site name and navigation.
* [The Site Navigation](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-site-navigation/) — the sidebar that helps you find your content.
* [The File Browser](/documentation/user-articles/the-file-browser/) — browse and manage files in your repository.
* [Collections](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-collection/) — groups of related content like blog posts or pages.
* [Output Files](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-an-output-file/) — understand how built files differ from source files.
* [Editing Interfaces](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-visual-editor/) — the Visual, Content, Data, and Source Editors.

Let's briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## Sites

Sites are the main way CloudCannon organizes your content. Each Site connects to a branch of your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/g/git-repository.yml">Git repository</comp.GlossaryTerm>. The Site header at the top of the screen shows which Site you are viewing and provides access to Site settings.

For a more in-depth explanation of the Site interface, please read our documentation:

* [What is the Site Header?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-site-header/)
* [What is the Site Navigation?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-site-navigation/)
* [The File Browser](/documentation/user-articles/the-file-browser/)

## Collections

Collections are groups of related files, such as blog posts, team members, or product pages. You can browse collections in the Site Navigation and open any file to edit it. Collection items appear as cards that you can sort and filter.

For a more in-depth explanation of Collections, please read our documentation:

* [What is a collection?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-collection/)

## Editing Interfaces

CloudCannon offers four editing interfaces: the <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/v/visual-editor.yml">Visual Editor</comp.GlossaryTerm>, <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/c/content-editor.yml">Content Editor</comp.GlossaryTerm>, <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/d/data-editor.yml">Data Editor</comp.GlossaryTerm>, and <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/source-editor.yml">Source Editor</comp.GlossaryTerm>. Each provides a different way to edit your content. The Visual Editor lets you click directly on your page; the Content Editor is a rich text editor; the Data Editor shows structured fields; and the Source Editor shows the raw file.

For a more in-depth explanation of the editing interfaces, please read our documentation:

* [What is the Visual Editor?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-visual-editor/)
* [What is the Content Editor?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-content-editor/)
* [What is the Data Editor?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-data-editor/)
* [What is the Source Editor?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-source-editor/)
