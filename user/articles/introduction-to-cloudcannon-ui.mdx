The CloudCannon User Interface is where you manage your website content. Whether you are editing a blog post, adding a new staff member to your "About Us" page, or browsing your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/f/file.yml">files</comp.GlossaryTerm>, familiarizing yourself with the CloudCannon interface will help you work efficiently.

This section provides a tour of the CloudCannon app. You will learn what different elements are called, where to find specific tools, and how to navigate between your content. These articles are a great place to start for new Users, or to return to when you see an element referenced in another article.

In the CloudCannon UI section of our documentation, we cover:

* [Sites](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-site-header/) — learn about the Site header, navigation, and how to switch between Sites.
* [Collections](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-collection/) — groups of related content like blog posts or pages.
* [The File Browser](/documentation/user-articles/the-file-browser/) — browse and manage files in your repository.
* [Editing Interfaces](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-visual-editor/) — the Visual, Content, Data, and Source Editors.

Let's briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## Sites

Sites are the main way CloudCannon organizes your content. Each Site connects to a branch of your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/g/git-repository.yml">Git repository</comp.GlossaryTerm>. The Site header at the top of the screen shows which Site you are viewing and provides access to Site settings.

For a more in-depth explanation of the Site interface, please read our documentation:

* [What is the Site Header?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-site-header/)
* [What is the Site Navigation?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-site-navigation/)

## Browsers

Browsers in CloudCannon let you find, browse, sort, and open your website files. There are two main types of browsers: the *Collection Browser* for viewing collections of related content (like all your blog posts or all your product pages), and the File Browser for viewing your files by their location in your website's folder structure.

For a more in-depth explanation of these browsers, please read our documentation:

* What is the Collection Browser?
* [What is the File Browser?](/documentation/user-articles/the-file-browser/)

## Editing Interfaces

CloudCannon offers four editing interfaces: the <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/v/visual-editor.yml">Visual Editor</comp.GlossaryTerm>, <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/c/content-editor.yml">Content Editor</comp.GlossaryTerm>, <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/d/data-editor.yml">Data Editor</comp.GlossaryTerm>, and <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/source-editor.yml">Source Editor</comp.GlossaryTerm>. Each provides a different way to edit your content. The Visual Editor lets you click directly on your page; the Content Editor is a rich text editor; the Data Editor shows structured fields; and the Source Editor shows the raw file.

For a more in-depth explanation of the editing interfaces, please read our documentation:

* [What is the Visual Editor?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-visual-editor/)
* [What is the Content Editor?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-content-editor/)
* [What is the Data Editor?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-data-editor/)
* [What is the Source Editor?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-the-source-editor/)
