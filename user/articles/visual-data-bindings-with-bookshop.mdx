Bookshop defines a convention for building self-contained components in the templating languages supported by common static site generators. Using these conventions, Bookshop provides developer tooling that empowers you to integrate these components with your stack, build and browse UI components locally, and provide rich live editing experiences for your editors.

By default, Bookshop will automatically add data bindings when live editing. Read [the Bookshop Visual Data Bindings documentation for further information](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop/blob/main/guides/visual-data-bindings.adoc).
