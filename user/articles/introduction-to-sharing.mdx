Sharing in CloudCannon enables you to collaborate with others on your website content. You can invite <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/t/team-member.yml">team members</comp.GlossaryTerm> to your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/o/organization.yml">Organization</comp.GlossaryTerm>, give them access to specific <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site.yml">Sites</comp.GlossaryTerm>, and control what they can do through <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/p/permission-group.yml">Permission Groups</comp.GlossaryTerm>. You can also share a Site with clients who do not have a CloudCannon account.

Understanding sharing helps you manage your team effectively. You will learn how to add and remove team members, assign them to Permission Groups, use <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site-sharing.yml">Site Sharing</comp.GlossaryTerm> to limit access to specific Sites, and set up <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/c/client-sharing.yml">Client Sharing</comp.GlossaryTerm> for external collaborators.

In the Sharing section of our documentation, we cover:

* [Permission Groups](/documentation/user-articles/what-are-permission-groups/) — learn what permissions control and how Groups work.
* [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/user-articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/) — understand the built-in Groups and their permissions.
* [Add a team member to a Permission Group](/documentation/user-articles/add-a-team-member-to-a-permission-group/) — assign team members to Groups.
* [Organizations](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-an-organization/) — understand how Organizations structure your account.
* [Join or leave an Organization](/documentation/user-articles/join-or-leave-an-organization/) — manage your Organization membership.
* [Site Sharing](/documentation/user-articles/share-a-site-with-site-sharing/) — give a team member access to a specific Site.
* [Client Sharing](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-client-sharing/) — share a Site with someone outside your Organization.

Let's briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## Permission Groups

Permission Groups determine what actions a team member can perform in CloudCannon. Each Group has a set of permissions — for example, the Editors Group can edit content but cannot access the Source Editor. When you add a team member, you assign them to one or more Groups.

For a more in-depth explanation of Permission Groups, please read our documentation:

* [What are Permission Groups?](/documentation/user-articles/what-are-permission-groups/)
* [What are Default Permission Groups?](/documentation/user-articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/)
* [Add a team member to a Permission Group](/documentation/user-articles/add-a-team-member-to-a-permission-group/)
* [Manage my permissions](/documentation/user-articles/manage-my-permissions/)

## Organizations

Organizations are the top-level container for your CloudCannon account. They contain your Sites, team members, and billing. You may belong to multiple Organizations — for example, your employer's Organization and a client's Organization.

For a more in-depth explanation of Organizations, please read our documentation:

* [What is an Organization?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-an-organization/)
* [Join or leave an Organization](/documentation/user-articles/join-or-leave-an-organization/)

## Site Sharing

Site Sharing allows you to give a team member access to a specific Site without adding them to your Organization. This is useful when you want to collaborate with someone who has their own CloudCannon account but should only edit one Site.

For a more in-depth explanation of Site Sharing, please read our documentation:

* [Share a Site with Site Sharing](/documentation/user-articles/share-a-site-with-site-sharing/)

## Client Sharing

Client Sharing allows you to share a Site with someone who does not have a CloudCannon account. You create a site-specific password, and clients can log in to edit content through a simplified interface. This is useful for sharing with clients, contractors, or external reviewers.

For a more in-depth explanation of Client Sharing, please read our documentation:

* [What is Client Sharing?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-client-sharing/)
