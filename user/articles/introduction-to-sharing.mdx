CloudCannon allows you to collaborate with everyone who needs access to your website. This could include content writers, developers, product managers, finance teams, team leads, clients, project stakeholders, and more. For every person you invite, CloudCannon allows you to control which <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site.yml">Sites</comp.GlossaryTerm> they have access to, and which actions they can take.

Articles in this section are helpful for team leaders who need to manage access to CloudCannon, or for individual users to see what they have access to in CloudCannon.

In the Sharing section of our User documentation, we cover:

* Organizations — Learn about *Organizations*, including how to join or leave one, and add or remove a team member
* Permission Groups — Learn what actions you are permitted to take in CloudCannon, or manage a team members permissions
* Site Sharing — Learn how to share a specific *Site* (or *Sites*) on CloudCannon without inviting someone to your *Organization*
* Client Sharing — Learn how to share your *Site* on CloudCannon with an external collaborator, without them needing a CloudCannon account

Let's briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## Organizations

In CloudCannon, your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/o/organization.yml">Organization</comp.GlossaryTerm> is the highest level of content management on CloudCannon. Each *Organization* has an associated CloudCannon subscription and can contain all your websites, team members, and resources. You can be a member of multiple *Organizations* in CloudCannon.

For a more in-depth explanation of Organizations, please read our documentation:

* [What is an Organization?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-an-organization/)
* [What is a team member?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-team-member/)
* [Join or leave an Organization](/documentation/user-articles/join-or-leave-an-organization/)
* [Add a team member to your Organization](/documentation/user-articles/add-a-team-member-to-your-organization/)
* [Remove a team member from your Organization](/documentation/user-articles/remove-a-team-member-from-your-organization/)

## Permission Groups

<comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/p/permission-group.yml">Permission Groups</comp.GlossaryTerm> determine what actions a team member in your *Organization* can perform. Each *Permission Group* defines exactly what its members are allowed to see, edit, and create. Everyone in your *Organization* is a member of at least one *Permission Group*. CloudCannon provides five <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/d/default-permission-groups.yml">Default Permission Groups</comp.GlossaryTerm> for every *Organization*: Owners, Developers, Technical Editors, Editors, and Billing.

For a more in-depth explanation of Permission Groups, please read our documentation:

* [What are Permission Groups?](/documentation/user-articles/what-are-permission-groups/)
* [What are Default Permission Groups?](/documentation/user-articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/)
* [Manage my permissions](/documentation/user-articles/manage-my-permissions/)
* [Add a team member to a Permission Group](/documentation/user-articles/add-a-team-member-to-a-permission-group/)
* [Remove a team member from a Permission Group](/documentation/user-articles/remove-a-team-member-from-a-permission-group/)

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Some *Sites* may have *Custom Permission Groups* configured. For more information, please read our Developer Documentation on [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/developer-articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/).
</comp.Notice>

## Site Sharing

<comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site-sharing.yml">Site Sharing</comp.GlossaryTerm> allows you to give someone access to specific *Sites* in your *Organization*. This is useful when you want to collaborate with someone who has a CloudCannon account, without giving them access to all the *Sites* in your *Organization*.

For a more in-depth explanation of Site Sharing, please read our documentation:

* [Share a Site with Site Sharing](/documentation/user-articles/share-a-site-with-site-sharing/)

## Client Sharing

<comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/c/client-sharing.yml">Client Sharing</comp.GlossaryTerm> allows you to give someone who does not have a CloudCannon account access to a specific *Site* in your *Organization*. *Clients* will log in using a site-specific password and edit or review content through a simplified interface.

For a more in-depth explanation of Client Sharing, please read our documentation:

* [What is Client Sharing?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-client-sharing/)
