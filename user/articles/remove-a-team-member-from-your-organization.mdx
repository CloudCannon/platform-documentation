Alternatively, you can remove a team member from the *Team* page by clicking on the *Context Menu* in the top right of a member card and selecting *Remove from Organization*.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  You can remove multiple people from your Organization at once by deleting a Permission Group. This only works if:

  * You have Custom Permission Groups, AND
  * All the team members you want to remove from your Organization are only members of a single Permission Group.

  For more information, please read our documentation on [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/developer-articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/).
