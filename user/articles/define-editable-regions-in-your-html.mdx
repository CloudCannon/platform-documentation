Editable Regions enable you to visually edit content in your source HTML in place on your output HTML.

Editable Regions are HTML elements that you define as editable. Define broad sections to provide flexibility, or define separate regions to retain fine control over images and text elements. Editable Regions display yellow borders in the [Visual Editor](/documentation/edit/interfaces/visual-editor/) to indicate areas that can be updated.

Depending on the element an editable is applied to, editors see different options in the editor. There are four types available for editing content in place:

* Inline regions for editing plain text
* Image regions for editing image elements
* Block regions for editing rich text
* Content for editing rich text populated from file content sections

To define an Editable Region:

1. Identify the HTML element you want to be editable
2. Add `class="editable"` to the HTML element, or append `editable` to `class` if the attribute is already defined

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  JavaScript is supported in the [Visual Editor](/documentation/edit/interfaces/visual-editor/). However, HTML rendered with JavaScript on page load is not editable.

## Best practices for Editable Regions

Not all HTML elements can be edited safely in the Visual Editor. It’s important to think carefully about what you want to be edited, and add the "editable" class only to those elements.

Improperly applied Editable Regions allow team members to break the layout of your site, in ways that can only be fixed in the Source Editor. To prevent this, CloudCannon automatically detects problem cases and disables editing.

Here are some examples of common misuses of Editable Regions, why they don’t conform to best practices, and how to refactor them.

### Unsupported elements

<comp.CodeBlock language="HTML" source="">
```
<input type="checkbox" class="editable">
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Some elements are simply not editable in the Visual Editor. It’s unclear what it would mean to edit an `<input>`, and this probably was not the developer’s intention. Only the following HTML elements should be given the editable class:

* Blocks: `div`, `section`, `article`, `aside`, `main`, `footer`, `header`, `nav`
* Block text: `p`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `blockquote`, `li`, `dd`, `dt`
* Inline text: `span`, `small`, `strong`, `em`, `i`, `b`, `sub`, `sup`, `td`, `th`, `cite`
* Image: `img`
* Link: `a`

#### How to fix this

Remove the "editable" class.

If you need this element to be editable, you can configure a Snippet. Depending on your SSG, there are libraries of Snippets available, or you can create custom Snippets.

### Editable regions containing unsupported elements

<comp.CodeBlock language="HTML" source="">
```
<div class="editable">
  <input type="email" name="email" id="email" />
  <p>Enter your email</p>
</div>
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

This would create an editable region containing an uneditable element (`input`). If someone on your team backspaces too many times in this Editable Region, they could delete the `<input>` with no way to restore it.

#### How to fix this

Move the "editable" class directly onto the text you want to edit.

<comp.CodeBlock language="HTML" source="">
```
<form>
  <input type="email" name="email" id="email" />
  <p class="editable">Enter your email</p>
</form>
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

### Editable regions containing custom classes

<comp.CodeBlock language="HTML" source="">
```
<div class="editable">
  <p class="big">This text is big</p>
  <p class="small">This text is small<p>
</div>
```
</comp.CodeBlock>
