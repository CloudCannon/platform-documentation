Site Navigation is one of the main UI elements on each Site in CloudCannon. It is located on the left of the *Site*, just in from the *App Sidebar*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Navigation" alt="A screenshot of the Site Navigation shows links to pages for managing your Site content." title="The Site Navigation" type="ui-snippet"/>

The primary purpose of your *Site Navigation* is to provide links to all the pages you'll need to manage your website content. If you have many navigation items, the *Site Navigation* is scrollable.

The *Site Navigation* will always have a link to your *Site Dashboard* at the top, your *Collections* in the middle, and links to *Developer* pages like *File Browser* and *Site Settings* at the bottom. Depending on your configuration, it can also show links to the *Publishing* page and any *Inboxes* connected to your *Site*.

## *Site Navigation* Sections

### *Dashboard*, *Publishing*, and *Inboxes*

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Navigation-Dashboard-Publishing-Inbox" alt="A screenshot of the Site Navigation shows links to the Dashboard, Publishing, and Inbox pages." title="The Site Navigation" type="ui-snippet"/>

At the top of your *Site Navigation* are links to your *Site Dashboard*, *Publishing* page, and *Inboxes* (if configured).

The *Site Dashboard* is the hub for key information about your *Site*. The *Dashboard* is broken down into several tabs, including *Summary*, *Activity*, *Syncs*, *Builds*, *Build Deploys*, and *Guides*. You can click on these tabs to navigate between them. 

The *Publishing* page is where you will find information about your publishing workflow, if you have one configured (i.e., your *Site* is connected to a [Publish Branch](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-publish-branch/)). The *Publishing* page has several tabs: *Summary*, *Commits*, and *Changes*.

The *Inbox* page is where you will find all your visitor submissions from a CloudCannon form, if you have one configured. If you have multiple forms, each inbox will appear as a separate item in your *Site Navigation* under the *Inboxes* heading. For more information about *Inboxes*, please read our documentation on [forms](/documentation/developer-articles/getting-started-with-forms-on-cloudcannon/).

### *Collections*

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Navigation-Collections" alt="A screenshot of the Site Navigation shows links to the Collections on this Site, organized into groups." title="The Site Navigation" type="ui-snippet"/>

In the middle of your *Site Navigation* are links to each *Collection* on your *Site*. *Collections* are groups of files you want to edit in CloudCannon, such as a folder of pages, blog posts, product descriptions, or data files. Clicking on one of these links in your *Site Navigation* will open the *Collection Browser* for that collection of files.

For more information about *Collections*, please read our documentation on [Collections](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-collection/) in general.

### *Developer*

<comp.Notice info_type="permissions">
  <p>The <em>Developer</em> section of your <em>Site Navigation</em> is only visible to members of the Owners, Developers, or Technical Editors <a href="/documentation/user-articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/">Default Permission Groups</a>, or <a href="/documentation/developer-articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/">Custom Permission Groups</a> with the <code>site:source-editor</code> permission.</p>
</comp.Notice>

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Navigation-Developer" alt="A screenshot of the Site Navigation shows links to the File Browser and Site Settings." title="The Site Navigation" type="ui-snippet"/>

At the bottom of your *Site Navigation* are links to your *File Browser* and *Site Settings*. These links are under a pinned and collapsable *Developer* heading. These links are important for managing the *Site* itself, rather than its content.

The *File Browser* allows you to see all the website files CloudCannon has synced from your Git provider. You can browse, sort, and filter these files, as well as open them directly in the Source Editor. For more information about the *File Browser*, please read our documentation on the [File Browser](/documentation/user-articles/the-file-browser/).

The *Site Settings* page contains all the settings for your *Site*, including your builds, hosting, sharing, and more.
