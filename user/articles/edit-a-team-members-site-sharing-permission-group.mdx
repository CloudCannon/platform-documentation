There are two [Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-permission-groups/) available per Site for [Site Sharing](/documentation/articles/share-a-site-with-site-sharing/). These have identical permissions to the [Technical Editors](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/#technical-editors) and [Editors](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/#editors) Groups except with a Site scope. Site Sharing Permission Groups are named after the Site they provide access to.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Members of the Owners or Developers [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/) can update a team memberâ€™s Site Sharing Permission Group. If you are using [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/), any member with permission to access the `group:member:write` or `site:settings:site-sharing:write` resources can update a member's Site Sharing Permission Groups.
</comp.Notice>

To switch which Permission Group your team member belongs to:

1. Navigate to the *Site Sharing* page under *Site settings*.
2. Click on the member whose permissions you want to update. This will open the *Update team member Permission Group* modal.
3. Select the Permission Group to which you want to add the team member.
4. Click the *Update Group* button.
