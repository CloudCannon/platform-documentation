CloudCannon optimizes sites to load as fast as possible. CloudCannon minifies CSS with [clean-css](https://github.com/GoalSmashers/clean-css) and JavaScript with [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/). Externally hosted assets are not optimized.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Filenames containing -min or .min are not minified, as the filename suggests they have been minified already.
</comp.Notice>

All files output from a build are hosted on our CDN. Assets referenced in the HTML and CSS are rewritten to include a unique hash in the URL, which will be seen as `?cchid=abfc7a...`. This hash allows files that haven't changed between subsequent builds of your site to remain in the cache, while all other files are purged.

Optimizations are on by default, to toggle optimizations for your site:

1. Go to the *Site Settings* / *Compressor* section
2. Toggle **Minify and serve assets from CDN**
3. Click **Update Build Details**

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/builds-compressor.png" alt="Screenshot of compressor settings screen" title="" type="screenshot"/>

To turn off optimizations on individual elements, add the `.cms-no-rewrite` class to the element.

<comp.CodeBlock language="html" source="index.html">
```
<a href="/newsletters/january-summary.pdf" class="cms-no-rewrite">Download Latest Newsletter</a>

```
</comp.CodeBlock>

The element will not have the URL changed to append the `cchid`, but will have reduced cache performance.
