A Testing Domain is a free *.cloudvent.net* URL that CloudCannon assigns to every Site. Each Testing Domain uses a randomly generated adjective and noun separated by a hyphen (i.e., [grey-grouse.cloudvent.net](https://grey-grouse.cloudvent.net/) or [brave-submarine.cloudvent.net](https://brave-submarine.cloudvent.net/)).

Testing Domains are useful for seeing your content live after a successful [Site build](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-a-site-build/). If you use a [publishing workflow](/documentation/developer-guides/staging-workflow-guide/), your Testing Domain will allow you to see the content for each branch on its own domain.

You can [view your Testing Domain](/documentation/user-articles/view-your-testing-domain/) any time after your first successful Site build.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  To stop serving content on your Testing Domain, you can [set a password](/documentation/developer-articles/enable-password-authentication/) to prevent unauthorized visitors, enable [Headless Mode](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-headless-mode/), or contact our friendly [support team](/support/).
</comp.Notice>

You can use your CloudCannon Testing Domain as your primary domain; however, we don't recommend doing this for two reasons.

One, you cannot change the automatically generated domain name without creating a new Site on CloudCannon. The automatically generated domain may not be right for you or your Site. You can generate a new one by creating a new Site with the same files, but this can be inefficient.

Two, by default, CloudCannon automatically de-indexes Testing Domains so that they do not appear in search engines. CloudCannon does this by serving a *robots.txt* file on all Testing Domains.

## Custom Testing Domains

<comp.Notice info_type="pricing">
  **This feature is available on specific plans.** Custom Testing Domains are only available on our [Team and Enterprise plans](/pricing/) and for members of our [Partner Program](/partner-program/).
</comp.Notice>

Custom Testing Domain lets you choose the domain name for your `.cloudvent.net` URL. Choosing your Testing Domain improves your branding if you are sharing the URL outside of your Organization (e.g., sending a test Site to a client).

For access to this feature, please contact our friendly <a href="/support/" title="Contact support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support team</a>. We'll set you up with a unique handle for your Organization. This handle will become the suffix for all Testing Domains (e.g., `prefix-company-name.cloudvent.net`).

Whenever you create a new Site, the *Create a Site* page will ask you to enter a unique prefix to prepend to your custom Testing Domain.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Custom-Testing-Domain-Prefix" alt="The Site creation form shows an input field for Testing Domain Prefix, and shows that it will be prepended to '-company-name.cloudvent.net'." title="Custom Testing Domain Prefix field in Site creation" type="ui-snippet"/>

Take care when adding a custom Testing Domain to a new Site. Each full domain can only be used once, so you will never be able repeat that combination of "prefix" and "suffix".
