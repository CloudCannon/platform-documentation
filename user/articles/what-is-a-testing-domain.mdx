A Testing Domain is a free *.cloudvent.net* URL that CloudCannon assigns to every Site. Each Testing Domain uses a randomly generated adjective and noun separated by a hyphen (i.e., [grey-grouse.cloudvent.net](https://grey-grouse.cloudvent.net/) or [brave-submarine.cloudvent.net](https://brave-submarine.cloudvent.net/)).

Testing Domains are useful for seeing your content live after a successful [Site build](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-site-build/). If you use a [publishing workflow](/documentation/guides/staging-workflow-guide/), your Testing Domain will allow you to see the content for each branch on its own domain.

You can [view your Testing Domain](/documentation/articles/view-your-testing-domain/) any time after your first successful Site build.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  To stop serving content on your Testing Domain, you can [set a password](/documentation/articles/enable-password-authentication/) to prevent unauthorized visitors, enable [Headless Mode](/documentation/articles/what-is-headless-mode/), or contact our friendly [support team](/support/).

You can use your CloudCannon Testing Domain as your primary domain; however, we don't recommend doing this for two reasons.

One, you cannot change the automatically generated domain name without creating a new Site on CloudCannon. The automatically generated domain may not be right for you or your Site. You can generate a new one by creating a new Site with the same files, but this can be inefficient.

Two, by default, CloudCannon automatically de-indexes Testing Domains so that they do not appear in search engines. CloudCannon does this by serving a *robots.txt* file on all Testing Domains.
