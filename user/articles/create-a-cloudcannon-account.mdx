When you create an account on CloudCannon, you can manage your own websites, experiment with a website template, or join someone else's team to manage their content.

If this is your first time creating a CloudCannon account, we highly recommend reading the [Getting Started with CloudCannon](/documentation/developer-guides/getting-started-with-cloudcannon/) guide.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Do not share your CloudCannon password with anyone. CloudCannon employees will never ask you for your password.
</comp.Notice>

To create a CloudCannon account:

1. Open the [CloudCannon app](https://app.cloudcannon.com/register) using your Internet browser.
2. Click on the *Sign up with email* button.
3. Enter your email in the *Email address* field and click the *Send Code* button. CloudCannon will send a six-digit confirmation code to validate your email address. This validation email should arrive quickly and will expire after 10 minutes.
4. Enter the code in the *Confirmation Code* field and click *Continue*.
5. Enter your first name, last name, and an account password, and whether you are a developer or a content editor. Your password must be at least nine characters long.
