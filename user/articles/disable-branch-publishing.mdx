You can prevent a branched site from publishing content to another site. To disable publishing, disconnect the branched site from your publish site.

Navigate to the *Publishing* tab under *Site Settings* and click *Remove Publish Branch*. Click again to confirm.

Once your sites are disconnected, CloudCannon will remove the *Publish* button from the sidebar.
