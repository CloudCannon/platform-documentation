In web development, routing is the process that determines what content a visitor to your Site should see when they enter a URL in their Internet browser or change pages by clicking an internal link on your Site.

By default, when visitors enter a URL or click on a link, they will see the content for the file with a file name that matches the URL. In most cases, default routing will deliver the correct content to your user. However, you should employ custom routing in the following situations:

* You have updated the name of a page.
* You have updated your site architecture, specifically the subdirectories in your URL.
* You have deleted a page from your website.
* You want visitors to see a helpful, branded 404 page when they enter an incorrect URL.

On CloudCannon, you can:

* Use [custom routing](/documentation/articles/configure-custom-routing/) to redirect old page URLs or configure extra headers on a route.
* Send visitors to a [404 page](/documentation/articles/configure-a-404-page/) when they enter an incorrect URL.
* Remove the [URL extension](/documentation/articles/configure-extensionless-urls/) to create a cleaner-looking URL.
* Use [geolocation](/documentation/articles/configure-geolocation/) to detect which country your visitors are from.
