<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Forms are only available for Sites hosted through CloudCannon. If you host your Site externally, or use CloudCannon in [Headless Mode](/documentation/articles/what-is-headless-mode/), Forms will not work.
</comp.Notice>

CloudCannon forms allow you to receive form submissions from visitors to your website without requiring your own backend server. With CloudCannon forms, you can view your form submissions in CloudCannon, forward them to an email address, or integrate them with your workflow using webhooks. All submissions can be exported from within CloudCannon.

Forms are easy to set up and integrate a number of external providers. Spam checkers reduce the noise with optional extra security with Google ReCaptcha or hCaptcha.

CloudCannon integrates with four external providers at the moment:

1. IFTTT
2. Make
3. Slack
4. Zapier

Reach out if you need more from forms for your next project. We plan to build on forms in the future. Knowing we can help our customers could speed things up.
