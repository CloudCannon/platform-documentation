Connecting to your self-hosted GitLab allows you to work on your websites locally and have the changes sync to CloudCannon. File changes made on CloudCannon also get synced back to your self-hosted GitLab repository.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  To connect to a *GitLab.com* repository instead, follow the instructions listed for [GitLab](/documentation/articles/connecting-a-gitlab-respository-as-your-source/).
</comp.Notice>

## Connecting to an instance
Before syncing with a repository in your self-hosted GitLab, you need to connect CloudCannon to your self-hosted instance. You only need to do this once per account.

To connect to your self-hosted GitLab instance:

1. Go to *Settings* / *Self Hosted GitLab*
2. Enter the details for your self-hosted instance of GitLab
3. Click **Configure Self Hosted GitLab**

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/gitlab-self-hosted-settings.png" alt="Self hosted GitLab entry interface" type="screenshot" />

The details for this page come from the GitLab server under *User Settings / Applications*.

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/files-source-syncing-gitlab-settings.png" alt="Settings page from Gitlab" type="screenshot" />

The Redirect URI is [https://app.cloudcannon.com/self\_hosted\_gitlab/authorize/](https://app.cloudcannon.com/self_hosted_gitlab/authorize/) The minimal scopes required are:

1. api
2. read\_user
3. read\_repository
4. write\_repository
5. openid

Once completed, the key and secret will be available for use in CloudCannon. The URLs should match the form placeholders.

## Syncing with a repository


To connect a self-hosted GitLab repository and start syncing files, follow these instructions:

1. Go to *Site Settings* / *Syncing*
2. Select **Self Hosted GitLab repository**
3. Click **Authenticate**

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/gitlab-self-hosted-connect.png" alt="Settings page from Gitlab" type="screenshot" />


This will open a menu where you can connect to GitLab, via one of two methods.

### Connecting with your user account

You can connect to GitLab by authenticating with your user account. This will give your CloudCannon organization access to the same GitLab repositories you have access to.

This redirects you to your self-hosted GitLab repository. Log in and authorize CloudCannon access to your self-hosted GitLab account, after which you will be redirected back to CloudCannon to pick a repository to connect.

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/files-source-syncing-gitlab-oauth.png" alt="A menu with a button labelled 'Authenticate with GitLab'." type="screenshot" />

### Authenticating with a group access token

Alternatively, you can create a group access token in GitLab and save that token in CloudCannon. This will give your CloudCannon organization access to all the resources scoped to your token.
See GitLab's [Group access tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/settings/group_access_tokens.html) documentation for how to create and configure a token.
<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  For full functionality on CloudCannon, your group access token should have (at least) the Maintainer role, and the `api`, `read_api`, `read_repository`, and `write_repository` scopes.
</comp.Notice>

Copy the token into the **Group Access Token** field. You will also need to provide the expiry date of the token. CloudCannon will send a warning email to all owners of your organization when the token is about to expire.


Click **Save and authenticate** to finish.

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/files-source-syncing-gitlab-token.png" alt="A form with fields for token and expiry date, and a submit button." type="screenshot" />

Once you've authenticated, you can choose a GitLab repository, and a branch to connect to the site. If you don't have an appropriate branch ready, create a new one in GitLab and refresh this page.

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/gitlab-self-hosted-select-branch.png" alt="Settings page from Gitlab" type="screenshot" />

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Any existing files on your website will be replaced with the contents of the selected repository. Click **Backup and Sync** to continue, or exit the page to cancel the process.
</comp.Notice>

Your self-hosted GitLab is now connected. Changes you push to the Git repository are pulled in by CloudCannon. Any changes made on CloudCannon are automatically committed and pushed.

## Configuring your GitLab connection

Once you've connected your GitLab server, you can configure CloudCannon to support your particular infrastructure. You can find these configuration options under the *Server* tab of your Self Hosted GitLab settings. The options you have for configuring CloudCannon are:

* Minimum Access Level,
* Custom Headers, and
* Custom CA Certificate.

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/self-hosted-gitlab-settings.png" alt="Self Hosted GitLab settings interface" type="screenshot" />

The **Minimum Access Level** setting allows you to change the minimum
access CloudCannon requires to a GitLab repo to connect to it. By default
CloudCannon requires Maintainer access to a repo before syncing to it.
Self Hosted GitLab allows custom access level permissions so a lower
access level may be sufficient, depending on your setup.

The **Custom Headers** setting allows you to configure additional headers
for CloudCannon to use when connecting to your GitLab server. Custom
headers are passed using Git's `http.extraHeader` configuration option and in the
form `key:value`.

The **Custom CA Certificate** allows you to upload a PEM encoded
certificate or certificate chain for CloudCannon to trust during Git
operations. The certificate is passed using Git's `http.sslCAInfo`
configuration option.
