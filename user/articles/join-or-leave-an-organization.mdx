## Join an Organization

To join an [Organization](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-organization/) in CloudCannon, [an existing member must invite you](/documentation/articles/add-a-team-member-to-your-organization/). When someone invites you, CloudCannon will send you an email invitation with the name of the Organization.

To join an Organization in CloudCannon:

1. Log in to CloudCannon or create an account using the link in your email invitation.
2. Click on your avatar in the bottom left of the app to open the *Account menu* and select *Organizations*. This will open the *Organizations List* showing all your current Organizations and pending invitations.
3. Under *Pending invitations*, click the *Accept* button next to the Organization you want to join.

Once you accept an invitation, CloudCannon will add you to the Organization. You will automatically be a member of the [Permission Group(s)](/documentation/articles/what-are-permission-groups/) selected by the person who invited you.

Alternatively, you can decline an invitation by clicking the *Decline* button. However, once you decline an invitation to an Organization, a current member of that Organization must re-invite you if you want to join at a later date.

## Leave an Organization

To leave an Organization in CloudCannon:

1. Navigate to the *My permissions* page under *Org settings.*
2. Click the *Leave Organization* button in the top right.
3. Confirm that you want to leave this Organization by double clicking the *Leave Organization* button in the confirmation modal.

CloudCannon will remove you from this Organization.
