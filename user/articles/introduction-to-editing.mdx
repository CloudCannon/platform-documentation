Editing in CloudCannon allows anyone on your team to contribute to your website, regardless of technical expertise.

Articles in this section are useful for anyone who creates, edits, or manages content on your website.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If this is your first time creating a site on CloudCannon, or you need a refresher, check out our [Editing in CloudCannon](/documentation/user-guides/editing-in-cloudcannon/) guide!
</comp.Notice>

In the Editing section of our User documentation, we cover:

* Manage your files — Learn how to manage your website files through CloudCannon
* Using Inputs — Learn how to edit file data that isn't the main body of content

Let’s briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## Manage your files

Your website is made up of several files, from layout and developer files that control what each page looks like, to content files that control the text and images on a webpage. With CloudCannon, you can update your website content files easily.

For a more in-depth explanation of how to make changes to your content, please read our documentation:

* [Add a file](/documentation/user-articles/add-a-file/)
* [Edit your files](/documentation/user-articles/edit-your-files/)
* [Delete a file](/documentation/user-articles/delete-a-file/)
* [Save your changes](/documentation/user-articles/save-your-changes/)

## Using Inputs

In CloudCannon, you can use Inputs to edit file data that isn't the main body of content (e.g., titles, descriptions, authors, tags, etc.). These Inputs appear in the sidebar of  the <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/v/visual-editor.yml">Visual Editor</comp.GlossaryTerm> and <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/c/content-editor.yml">Content Editor</comp.GlossaryTerm>, and in the <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/d/data-editor.yml">Data Editor</comp.GlossaryTerm>. There are 12 types of Inputs, each with its own fields and controls for editing a specific kind of data.

For a more in-depth explanation of how to use Inputs for editing file data, please read our documentation:
