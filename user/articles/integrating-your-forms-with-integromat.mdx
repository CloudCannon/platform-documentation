  If you're looking to migrate your Integromat organization to Make, see [here](/documentation/articles/integrating-your-forms-with-make-formerly-integromat/) for a guide on integrating with Make
</comp.Notice>

You can integrate your CloudCannon forms with your Integromat scenarios using webhooks and the Integromat Inbox target.

To create an Integromat webhook:

1. In the Integromat console, open the *Scenarios* menu from the sidebar and click the *Create a new scenario* button.
2. Add a *Webhooks* module and select *Custom webhook* as its type.
3. When prompted to select a webhook, click the *Add* button and create a new webhook.
4. After you've created your webhook, click the *Copy address to clipboard* button. You'll need this URL to create the Integromat target. If you need to refer back to this URL you can do so from the *Webhooks* menu in the sidebar.
5. Add any additional modules that you want, then save your scenario.
