<comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/h/hosting.yml">Hosting</comp.GlossaryTerm> is when your website is made available on the Internet for visitors to view. If your developer has configured hosting through CloudCannon, your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site.yml">Site</comp.GlossaryTerm> will have a <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/t/testing-domain.yml">Testing Domain</comp.GlossaryTerm> where you can preview your content live. You may also have a <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/c/custom-domain.yml">Custom Domain</comp.GlossaryTerm> for your production website.

This section covers what you need to know about hosting as a User. You will learn about web hosting basics, how to view your Testing Domain, and how to access form submissions that visitors submit through your website.

In the Hosting section of our documentation, we cover:

* [Web Hosting](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-web-hosting/) — learn the basics of getting your website live on the Internet.
* [Testing Domain](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-testing-domain/) — the free preview URL provided for each Site.
* [View your Testing Domain](/documentation/user-articles/view-your-testing-domain/) — see your content live on the Testing Domain.
* [Forms](/documentation/user-articles/viewing-your-form-submissions-in-cloudcannon/) — view and manage form submissions.
* [Form submissions in your inbox](/documentation/user-articles/reading-form-submissions-in-your-inbox/) — receive form submissions via email.

Let's briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## Web Hosting

Web hosting is where your website files are stored on a server and made available to visitors on the Internet. CloudCannon can host your Site after it is built, or your developer may use an external hosting service. If CloudCannon hosts your Site, you will have access to a Testing Domain and optionally a Custom Domain.

For a more in-depth explanation of web hosting, please read our documentation:

* [What is web hosting?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-web-hosting/)

## Testing Domain

Every Site on CloudCannon is assigned a free Testing Domain with a cloudvent.net URL. This allows you to preview your content live after a successful build. The Testing Domain is useful for reviewing changes before they go to your live Custom Domain.

For a more in-depth explanation of Testing Domains, please read our documentation:

* [What is a Testing Domain?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-testing-domain/)
* [View your Testing Domain](/documentation/user-articles/view-your-testing-domain/)

## Forms

If your website has forms — for example, a contact form or newsletter signup — CloudCannon can collect the submissions. You can view submissions in the CloudCannon interface or have them sent to your email <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/i/inbox.yml">inbox</comp.GlossaryTerm>.

For a more in-depth explanation of forms, please read our documentation:

* [Viewing your form submissions in CloudCannon](/documentation/user-articles/viewing-your-form-submissions-in-cloudcannon/)
* [Reading form submissions in your inbox](/documentation/user-articles/reading-form-submissions-in-your-inbox/)
