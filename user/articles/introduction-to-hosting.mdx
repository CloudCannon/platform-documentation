<comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/h/hosting.yml">Hosting</comp.GlossaryTerm> is the process of making your website available on the Internet for visitors to view. Hosting through CloudCannon is optional, and your developer may choose to host with a different service. However, CloudCannon offers additional features if you also host your *Site* here.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Not all *Sites* are hosted on CloudCannon. Please talk to your developer about whether hosting is relevant to your website.
</comp.Notice>

In the Hosting section of our User documentation, we cover:

* Web Hosting — Learn how CloudCannon protects your unsaved changes when someone saves changes to the same file
* Testing Domain — Learn how you can work on a *Branch* (your own copy of your website), and update the *Publish Branch* (the main copy of your website)
* Forms — Learn how CloudCannon protects the saved changes on your *Branch* when they conflict with changes from your *Publish Branch*

Let's briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## Web Hosting

Web hosting is the process by which your website files are made available to visitors on the Internet. To host your website, you will need a web hosting service, such as CloudCannon or another third-party provider.

For a more in-depth explanation of how web hosting works, please read our documentation:

* [What is web hosting?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-web-hosting/)

## Testing Domain

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  This information is specific to *Sites* hosted through CloudCannon.
</comp.Notice>

Every website has a <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/d/domain-name.yml">Domain Name</comp.GlossaryTerm> to allow visitors to access it online. On CloudCannon, every *Site*  is assigned a free <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/t/testing-domain.yml">Testing Domain</comp.GlossaryTerm>, for you to see your live content. This is particularly useful if you have a publishing workflow configured, providing each *Branch Site* with a dedicated *Domain*.

For a more in-depth explanation of Testing Domains, please read our documentation:

* [What is a Testing Domain?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-testing-domain/)
* [View your Testing Domain](/documentation/user-articles/view-your-testing-domain/)

## Forms

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  This information is specific to *Sites* hosted through CloudCannon, where your developer has configured forms.
</comp.Notice>

If your website has <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/f/form.yml">Forms</comp.GlossaryTerm> — for example, a contact form or newsletter signup — CloudCannon can collect the submissions. You can view submissions in the CloudCannon interface or have them sent to your email <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/i/inbox.yml">inbox</comp.GlossaryTerm>.

For a more in-depth explanation of forms, please read our documentation:

* [Viewing your form submissions in CloudCannon](/documentation/user-articles/viewing-your-form-submissions-in-cloudcannon/)
