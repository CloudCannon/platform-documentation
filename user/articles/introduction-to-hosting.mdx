Web hosting is when you make your website available on the Internet. You can host your Site through CloudCannon with a free Testing Domain or by connecting your Custom Domain. Configuring hosting includes managing your DNS settings, securing your website with an SSL certificate, and setting up optional features such as routing and authentication.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Hosting your Site through CloudCannon is optional. You can always edit your Site using CloudCannon as your CMS and host your content through an external hosting service.

Let's briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## What is web hosting?

Web hosting is where, after a successful [build](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-site-build/), all your files are stored on a web server and made available to the public on the Internet. You can host your Site through CloudCannon, or through an external service.

For a more in-depth explanation of web hosting, please read our documentation:

* [What is web hosting?](/documentation/articles/what-is-web-hosting/)

## Testing Domains

Every Site on CloudCannon is assigned a free Testing Domain with the *.cloudvent.net* URL.  A Testing Domain is useful for seeing your content live after a successful [Site build](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-site-build/). If you use a [publishing workflow](/documentation/guides/staging-workflow-guide/), your Testing Domain will allow you to see the content for each branch on its own domain.

For a more in-depth explanation of Testing Domains, please read our documentation:

* [What is a Testing Domain?](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-testing-domain/)
* [View your Testing Domain](/documentation/articles/view-your-testing-domain/)

## Custom Domains

A Custom Domain is a unique address used to identify a website. For example, CloudCannon's domain is [cloudcannon.com](https://cloudcannon.com/). The domain is the part of your URL that users are most likely to remember. To host on CloudCannon, you need to connect your Custom Domain to your Organization.

For a more in-depth explanation of Custom Domains, including how to add them to your CloudCannon Organization, please read our documentation:

* [What are Custom Domains?](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/)
* [Connect a Custom Domain to your Organization](/documentation/developer-articles/connect-a-custom-domain-to-your-organization/)
* [Disconnect a Custom Domain from your Organization](/documentation/developer-articles/disconnect-a-custom-domain-from-your-organization/)
* [Add a Custom Domain to your Site](/documentation/developer-articles/add-a-custom-domain-to-your-site/)
* [Remove a Custom Domain to from Site](/documentation/developer-articles/remove-a-custom-domain-from-your-site/)
* [Update the Fallback Redirect for your Custom Domain](/documentation/developer-articles/update-the-fallback-redirect-for-your-custom-domain/)

## DNS

The Domain Name System (DNS) allows your computer to translate a domain name into an IP address. DNS providers, like CloudCannon or other external providers, allow you to manage your domain's DNS records.

For a more in-depth explanation of DNS, including how to configure CloudCannon or external DNS, please read our documentation:

* [What is DNS?](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-dns/)
* [Configure CloudCannon DNS](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-cloudcannon-dns/)
* [Configure external DNS](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-external-dns/)

## SSL certificates

An SSL certificate (or a TLS certificate) is a periodically regenerated digital certificate that supports your website's authenticity and enables encryption for greater security between your web server and the visitor's browser. On CloudCannon, any Site with a [Custom Domain](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/) can use an auto-generated or custom SSL certificate.

For a more in-depth explanation of SSL certificates, please read our documentation:

* [What is an SSL certificate?](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/)
* [Add an auto-generated SSL certificate](/documentation/developer-articles/add-an-auto-generated-ssl-certificate/)
* [Add a custom SSL certificate](/documentation/developer-articles/add-a-custom-ssl-certificate/)

## Routing

Routing is the process that determines what content a visitor to your Site should see when they enter a URL in their Internet browser. On CloudCannon, you can configure custom routing to extend default routing behavior, such what to show when a page cannot be found or has moved permanently. You can also use routing to specify custom headers for your hosted site, such as Cross-Origin Resource Sharing or Content Security Policies.

For a more in-depth explanation of routing, please read our documentation:

* [What is routing?](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-routing/)
* [Configure custom routing](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-custom-routing/)
* [Configure a 404 page](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-a-404-page/)
* [Configure extensionless URLs](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-extensionless-urls/)
* [Configure geolocation](/documentation/developer-articles/configure-geolocation/)
* [Configure HTTP redirects](/documentation/articles/configure-http-redirects/)

## Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity. If you host your Site on CloudCannon, you can require visitors to authenticate their identity before they can access some or all of your content. CloudCannon supports password, user account, and SAML authentication methods and can generate a bearer token for machine users.

For a more in-depth explanation of authentication, please read our documentation:

* [What is authentication?](/documentation/articles/what-is-authentication/)
* [Enable password authentication](/documentation/articles/enable-password-authentication/)
* [Enable user account authentication](/documentation/articles/enable-user-account-authentication/)
* [Enable SAML authentication](/documentation/articles/enable-saml-authentication/)
* [Allow authenticated users to log out](/documentation/articles/allow-authenticated-users-to-log-out/)
* [Configure authenticated routes](/documentation/articles/configure-authenticated-routes/)
* [Generate a bearer token](/documentation/articles/generate-a-bearer-token/)
