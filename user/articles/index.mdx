Welcome to CloudCannon's User Documentation. These articles cover everything you need to know about using CloudCannon.

A User is anyone who uses CloudCannon, from managing your website content to organizing your team members and CloudCannon subscription. A Developer can also be a User, but Developers also customize CloudCannon for use by their team members or clients.

As a User, you'll be working in the CloudCannon web app ([https://app.cloudcannon.com/](https://app.cloudcannon.com/)) rather than a development environment. CloudCannon's User Interface (UI) provides you with all the tools you need. The articles in this section of our documentation are designed to explain CloudCannon concepts and provide instructions for achieving your content management goals.

If you need further assistance with your website on CloudCannon, contact your developer or our friendly [support team](/support/).

These articles are a great place to start for new Users, or to return to when you see an element of UI referenced in another article and you need a refresher.
