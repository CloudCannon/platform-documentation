Your CloudCannon account is where you manage your identity, billing, and Organization membership. You can create or delete an account, update your payment details, join or leave Organizations, and add an extra layer of security with Multi-factor Authentication.

Understanding your account settings helps you maintain control over your subscription and ensure secure access. This section covers everything from creating an account to managing your billing and recovering access if you are locked out.

In the Accounts section of our documentation, we cover:

* [Create a CloudCannon account](/documentation/user-articles/create-a-cloudcannon-account/) — sign up for CloudCannon.
* [How to pay for CloudCannon](/documentation/user-articles/how-to-pay-for-cloudcannon/) — manage your subscription and payment method.
* [Accessing and configuring your invoices](/documentation/user-articles/accessing-and-configuring-your-invoices/) — view and download invoices.
* [Organizations](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-an-organization/) — understand how Organizations structure your account.
* [Join or leave an Organization](/documentation/user-articles/join-or-leave-an-organization/) — manage your Organization membership.
* [Multi-factor Authentication](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-multi-factor-authentication/) — add an extra layer of security to your login.

Let's briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## CloudCannon Accounts

Creating a CloudCannon account is the first step to using the platform. You can sign up with an email address or use a Git provider like GitHub for authentication. Once your account is created, you can join Organizations or create your own.

For a more in-depth explanation of account creation, please read our documentation:

* [Create a CloudCannon account](/documentation/user-articles/create-a-cloudcannon-account/)

## Billing

CloudCannon subscriptions are billed based on your plan and usage. You can update your payment method, view invoices, and understand how CloudCannon handles failed payments. Organization Owners have access to billing settings.

For a more in-depth explanation of billing, please read our documentation:

* [How to pay for CloudCannon](/documentation/user-articles/how-to-pay-for-cloudcannon/)
* [Accessing and configuring your invoices](/documentation/user-articles/accessing-and-configuring-your-invoices/)
* [How CloudCannon handles failed payments](/documentation/user-articles/how-cloudcannon-handles-failed-payments/)

## Organizations

Organizations are the top-level container for <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site.yml">Sites</comp.GlossaryTerm>, <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/t/team-member.yml">team members</comp.GlossaryTerm>, and billing. You may belong to multiple Organizations — for example, your employer's and a client's. Organization Owners can manage membership, billing, and settings.

For a more in-depth explanation of Organizations, please read our documentation:

* [What is an Organization?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-an-organization/)
* [Join or leave an Organization](/documentation/user-articles/join-or-leave-an-organization/)
* [Recovering access to your Organization](/documentation/user-articles/recovering-access-to-your-organization/)
* [Resolving ownership over a Custom Domain](/documentation/user-articles/resolving-ownership-over-a-custom-domain/)

## Multi-factor Authentication

Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) adds a second factor to your login — typically a code from an authenticator app. This helps protect your account even if your password is compromised. You can enable MFA in your account settings.

For a more in-depth explanation of Multi-factor Authentication, please read our documentation:

* [What is Multi-factor Authentication?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-multi-factor-authentication/)
* [Generate new recovery codes](/documentation/user-articles/generate-new-recovery-codes/)
