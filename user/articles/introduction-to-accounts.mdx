Your CloudCannon account is where you manage your identity, billing, and Organization subscription.

Articles in this section are useful for everyone with a CloudCannon account, *Organization Owners*, and team members responsible for your CloudCannon subscription.

In the Accounts section of our User documentation, we cover:

* CloudCannon Accounts — Learn how to create, manage, and delete your CloudCannon account
* Billing — Learn how to manage your CloudCannon subscription, including payment details and invoices
* Owning an Organization — Learn how to manage and customize your *Organization*
* Multi-factor Authentication — Learn how to protect your CloudCannon account with additional identity authentication

Let's briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## CloudCannon Accounts

To use CloudCannon, you need to have a CloudCannon account (unless you are using [Client Sharing](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-client-sharing/)). Your CloudCannon account allows you to own *Organizations* or be a member of someone else's *Organization*.

For a more in-depth explanation of accounts, please read our documentation:

* [Create a CloudCannon account](/documentation/user-articles/create-a-cloudcannon-account/)

## Billing

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  For the most up-to-date information on CloudCannon subscriptions, please see our [pricing page](/pricing/).
</comp.Notice>

CloudCannon subscriptions are based on the plan and usage for each *Organization*. Members of the *Owners* or *Billing* [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/user-articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/) can manage your subscription, payment details, and invoices through CloudCannon.

For a more in-depth explanation of billing, please read our documentation:

* [How to pay for CloudCannon](/documentation/user-articles/how-to-pay-for-cloudcannon/)
* [Accessing and configuring your invoices](/documentation/user-articles/accessing-and-configuring-your-invoices/)
* [How CloudCannon handles failed payments](/documentation/user-articles/how-cloudcannon-handles-failed-payments/)

## Owning an Organization

You can be the owner of several *Organizations* in CloudCannon, each with its own subscription, <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/t/team-member.yml">team members</comp.GlossaryTerm>, and <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site.yml">Sites</comp.GlossaryTerm>. Anyone in the *Owners* [Default Permission Group](/documentation/user-articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/) can customize and manage an *Organization*.

For a more in-depth explanation of owning an Organization, please read our documentation:

* [Customize CloudCannon to match your brand](/documentation/user-articles/customizing-cloudcannon-to-match-your-brand/)
* [Recover access to your Organization](/documentation/user-articles/recovering-access-to-your-organization/)
* [Resolve ownership over a Custom Domain](/documentation/user-articles/resolving-ownership-over-a-custom-domain/)

## Multi-factor Authentication

<comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/m/multi-factor-authentication.yml">Multi-factor Authentication</comp.GlossaryTerm> adds an additional identity verification step when you log in to CloudCannon, such as entering a temporary code from an authenticator app. For security or auditing reasons, your *Organization* may require you to use MFA.

For a more in-depth explanation of Multi-factor Authentication, please read our documentation:

* [What is Multi-factor Authentication?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-multi-factor-authentication/)
* [Generate new recovery codes](/documentation/user-articles/generate-new-recovery-codes/)
