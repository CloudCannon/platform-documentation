CloudCannon uses Git to store your files securely and enable version control. Syncing is the two-way connection between your Git repository and CloudCannon — when you save changes, they are committed and pushed to your repository. Publishing is how changes flow from a test or branch copy of your website to the live version your visitors see.

Understanding syncing and publishing helps you work effectively with your team. You will learn when syncing might be paused, how to use publish branches for staging workflows, and how to resolve conflicts when multiple people edit the same content.

In the Syncing & Publishing section of our documentation, we cover:

* [Syncing Paused](/documentation/user-articles/why-is-syncing-paused/) — understand when and why CloudCannon pauses syncing.
* [Resume syncing](/documentation/user-articles/resume-syncing/) — turn syncing back on when it has been paused.
* [Publish Branches](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-publish-branch/) — learn about branching workflows for staging changes.
* [Update from a Publish Branch](/documentation/user-articles/update-from-a-publish-branch/) — bring changes from your branch into your main <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site.yml">Site</comp.GlossaryTerm>.
* [Publishing Conflicts](/documentation/user-articles/what-are-publishing-conflicts/) — understand when conflicts occur.
* [Resolve publishing conflicts](/documentation/user-articles/resolve-publishing-conflicts/) — resolve conflicts when they arise.

Let's briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## Syncing Paused

CloudCannon may pause syncing in certain situations, such as when a build is in progress or when your developer has configured a pause. When syncing is paused, your changes are saved locally in CloudCannon but not yet pushed to your Git repository.

For a more in-depth explanation of syncing pauses, including how to resume syncing, please read our documentation:

* [Why is syncing paused?](/documentation/user-articles/why-is-syncing-paused/)
* [Resume syncing](/documentation/user-articles/resume-syncing/)

## Branching

If your developer has set up a branching workflow, you may work on a branch Site that is separate from your live website. When you are ready, you can publish your changes to update the main Site. Branching allows you to test changes before they go live.

For a more in-depth explanation of branching, please read our documentation:

* [What is a Publish Branch?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-publish-branch/)
* [Update from a Publish Branch](/documentation/user-articles/update-from-a-publish-branch/)

## Publishing Conflicts

A publishing conflict occurs when CloudCannon cannot automatically merge your changes with the current state of your repository. This can happen when you and a team member have both edited the same file. CloudCannon will guide you through resolving the conflict.

For a more in-depth explanation of publishing conflicts, please read our documentation:

* [What are publishing conflicts?](/documentation/user-articles/what-are-publishing-conflicts/)
* [Resolve publishing conflicts](/documentation/user-articles/resolve-publishing-conflicts/)
