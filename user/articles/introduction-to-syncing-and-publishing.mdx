CloudCannon uses a technology called <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/g/git.yml">Git</comp.GlossaryTerm>. *Git* safely stores your website files, lets you revert to previous versions of your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site.yml">Site</comp.GlossaryTerm> (in case something goes wrong), allows you to maintain multiple copies of your *Site*, and tracks who made which changes and when. Most of the *Git* side of CloudCannon is managed by your developer, but it's important to know some *Git* terms for updating content, too.

* <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/syncing.yml">Syncing</comp.GlossaryTerm> is when CloudCannon automatically synchronizes the content of your website stored in your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/g/git-repository.yml">Git Repository</comp.GlossaryTerm> (the safe place where your developer stores your website files) and your *Site* on CloudCannon. This means that any changes made to your website are reflected in both places: whether it's a content update in CloudCannon or a code change by a developer.
* *Publishing* is when CloudCannon publishes changes from one copy of your website to another, allowing you to test your content updates on a dedicated copy of your website before they go public.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Not all *Sites* will have a publishing workflow configured. Please talk to your developer about whether publishing is relevant to your website.
</comp.Notice>

In the Syncing & Publishing section of our User documentation, we cover:

* Syncing Paused — Learn how CloudCannon protects your unsaved changes when someone saves changes to the same file
* Branching — Learn how you can work on a *Branch* (your own copy of your website), and update the *Publish Branch* (the main copy of your website)
* Publishing Conflicts — Learn how CloudCannon protects the saved changes on your *Branch* when they conflict with changes from your *Publish Branch*

Let's briefly introduce a few of these topics.

## Syncing Paused

Sometimes, CloudCannon may pause syncing while you have unsaved changes on your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site.yml">Site</comp.GlossaryTerm>.  This is to protect your unsaved changes from incoming changes made by other people. You can easily resolve this by saving your unsaved changes.

For a more in-depth explanation of syncing paused, please read our documentation:

* [Why is syncing paused?](/documentation/user-articles/why-is-syncing-paused/)
* [Resume syncing](/documentation/user-articles/resume-syncing/)

## Branching

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  This information is specific to *Sites* with a publishing workflow.
</comp.Notice>

If your developer has added a publishing workflow to your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site.yml">Site</comp.GlossaryTerm>, everyone can work on their own copy of your website, called a *Branch*. While editing on your *Branch*, you don't need to worry about your changes going live: only you and anyone you share the link with will see your *Site*.

When you are ready for these changes to go live, you can publish to the main copy of your website, called a *Publish Branch*. Also, if anyone else updates your main *Branch* from another copy of your *Site*, you can easily update your copy of the website from the *Publish Branch*.

For a more in-depth explanation of branching, please read our documentation:

* [What is a Publish Branch?](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-publish-branch/)
* [Update from a Publish Branch](/documentation/user-articles/update-from-a-publish-branch/)

## Publishing Conflicts

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  This information is specific to *Sites* with a publishing workflow.
</comp.Notice>

Sometimes, when you try to update from your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/p/publish-branch.yml">Publish Branch</comp.GlossaryTerm>, CloudCannon will warn you about a <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/p/publishing-conflict.yml">Publishing Conflict</comp.GlossaryTerm>. This happens when the saved changes on your *Branch* and the saved changes to the same file on your *Publish Branch* are different. CloudCannon will help you resolve this conflict by allowing you to choose which changes to keep, preventing one set of changes from overwriting the other.

For a more in-depth explanation of publishing conflicts, please read our documentation:

* [What are publishing conflicts?](/documentation/user-articles/what-are-publishing-conflicts/)
* [Resolve publishing conflicts](/documentation/user-articles/resolve-publishing-conflicts/)
