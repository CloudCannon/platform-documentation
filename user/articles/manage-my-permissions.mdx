## Review my current Permission Groups

Permissions control what actions you can perform within your [Organization](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-organization/). Your permissions are determined by which [Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-permission-groups/) you belong to.

To view your current permissions:

1. Navigate to the *My permissions* page under *Org settings.*

## Leave a Permission Group

You can leave a Permission Group at any time. However, you may not have permission to add yourself to a Group. If you accidentally remove yourself from a Permission Group, please contact the appropriate member of your team or read our documentation on [adding team members to a Permission Group](/documentation/articles/add-a-team-member-to-a-permission-group/).

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  You must be a member of at least one Permission Group in each Organization. If you leave your last Permission Group, this action will also remove you from the Organization.
</comp.Notice>

To leave a Permission Group:

1. Navigate to the *My permissions* tab under *Org settings.*
2. Identify the Permission Group you want to leave and click on the *Context Menu*.
3. Select the *Leave Group* option from the *Context Menu* dropdown.
4. Confirm that you want to leave this Group by clicking the *Leave Group* button in the confirmation modal.
