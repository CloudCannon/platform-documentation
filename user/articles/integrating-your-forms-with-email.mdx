You can choose to forward submissions from your CloudCannon forms to your email address by using the email Inbox target.

To create an email target:

1. Navigate to the forms menu in your Organization settings, under *Hosting &gt; Forms.*
2. Open your Inbox settings by clicking the *Manage* button on the Inbox you want to receive email from.
3. Open the *Add new target* menu, and set the *Type* to *Email.*
4. Set the *Target* to the email address to send submissions to, then click *Add Inbox target*.

At this point, you should receive a validation link at that email address. Once you click that link, the target will be validated and begin receiving form submission emails.

### Special Fields
Use these fields to customize the email CloudCannon sends through the form. The fields can be hidden or visible, depending on your requirements.

`_replyto` — the value used for the Reply-To header in the email. Use this to ensure clients reply to the visitor rather than a default CloudCannon address.
