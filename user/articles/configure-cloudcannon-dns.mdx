CloudCannon DNS allows you to manage your DNS records within CloudCannon for each [Custom Domain](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/) added to your [Organization](/documentation/articles/what-is-an-organization/). If you use CloudCannon DNS, you can also use a free [auto-generated SSL certificate](/documentation/articles/add-an-auto-generated-ssl-certificate/) for your Sites.

Before configuring your Site's DNS, you must [add a Custom Domain](/documentation/articles/add-a-custom-domain/).

## Enable CloudCannon DNS

CloudCannon will enable CloudCannon DNS for your Site by default. If you want to switch back to CloudCannon DNS from an external DNS service or confirm that you have CloudCannon DNS enabled, you can check the *Domain Settings* page.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Updating your DNS provider can cause downtime for anything connected to your domain, such as your website or custom email address. Please make sure you have a copy of your existing DNS records before you change providers.

  If you need help updating your DNS, please contact our friendly [support team](/support/).
</comp.Notice>

To switch to CloudCannon DNS:

1. Navigate to the *Domain browser* by clicking the globe icon in your *App Navigation*.
2. Select the domain for which you want to configure DNS.
3. Under the *Domain Settings* tab, open the *DNS* section.
4. Select the *CloudCannon DNS* option in the *DNS Provider* dropdown.
5. Click the *Update DNS Provider* button.

CloudCannon will now manage your DNS records.

## Configure your Nameservers

If you have yet to configure your Nameservers or have done so incorrectly, CloudCannon will warn you on the *Custom Domain* page under *Site Settings* that this action is required.

<comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/hosting/configure-cloudcannon-dns/2024-11/CloudCannon-Documentation-Custom-Domain-Nameserver-Setup.png" alt="A screenshot of the Custom Domain page under Site Settings shows the Unexpected Response Found warning for misconfigured Nameservers." title="The Custom Domain page" type="screenshot"/>

Configuring your Nameservers requires you to use the services provided by your Domain Registrar. For support, please contact your Domain Registrar.

To configure your Nameservers:

1. Log in to your third-party Domain Registrar with the account details used when you purchased your Domain Name. If you don't know who your Domain Registrar is, you can enter the Domain Name into the [ICANN website](https://lookup.icann.org/en/lookup) and scroll down to Registrar Information.
2. Update the Nameserver configuration on your Domain Registrar to the *Expected Nameservers* listed on the *Custom Domain* page. Normally, these are *asa.ns.cloudflare.com* and *roan.ns.cloudflare.com*.

CloudCannon will update the *Custom Domain* page once your Registrar has propagated the updated Nameservers. To refresh the page, click the *Check again* button at the bottom.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Domain Registrars typically process Nameserver updates within 24 hours.
</comp.Notice>

## Add DNS records

[DNS records](/documentation/articles/what-is-dns/#what-are-dns-records) are instructions for a Domain Name managed by an authoritative nameserver. By enabling CloudCannon DNS, you allow CloudCannon's servers to manage your DNS records.

To add a DNS record:

1. Navigate to the *Domain browser* by clicking the globe icon in your *App Navigation*.
2. Select the domain for which you want to configure DNS.
3. Under the *Domain Settings* tab, open the *DNS* section.
4. Click the *\+ Add Record* button.
5. In the *Add DNS record* modal, use the *Type* dropdown to select the type of record. Valid options include *A*, *AAAA*, *CNAME*, *MX*, *SPF*, *SRV*, and *TXT*.
6. CloudCannon will update the fields in the *Add DNS record* modal depending on the record type. Enter the details for your DNS record.
7. When you are happy with your record details, click the *Add Record* button.

CloudCannon will add the DNS record to your DNS settings.

You can edit or delete existing DNS records by clicking the *Context Menu* button for a record and selecting the *Update* or *Remove* option.

### CloudCannon CNAME records

When you enable CloudCannon DNS, CloudCannon will add two CNAME records to your DNS records.

1. \*.example.com is an alias for sites.cloudcannon.com
2. example.com is an alias for sites.cloudcannon.com

These records instruct servers completing a *DNS lookup* for your Site's base domain (and all its subdomains) to search for the IP address of sites.cloudcannon.com. This allows users looking for your website to find the IP address of the CloudCannon server hosting your Site.
