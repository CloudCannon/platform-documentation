CloudCannon is constantly monitoring your branch in your Git repository. When someone saves a change to your branch, CloudCannon will sync that change to all CloudCannon Sites connected to that branch by overwriting the version of your file on your Site with the version from your Git repository. This behavior keeps your CloudCannon Site up to date with your Git repository.

To prevent incoming changes from overwriting your unsaved changes, CloudCannon will pause Syncing if an incoming change from your Git repository affects a file with unsaved changes.

* **Incoming changes** â€” These are changes to your Site files originating from outside the branch you are working on, such as from a different CloudCannon Site or your git repository. All incoming changes are made by a member of your team.

CloudCannon will notify you about a Syncing Conflict using the *Syncing paused* warning notification above the *Save* button in your *Site Navigation*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Save-Button-Syncing-Paused-Notification" alt="A screenshot of the Save Button in the Site Navigation shows a Sync Paused warning notification in the top right." title="The Save Button" type="ui-snippet"/>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Incoming changes from your Git repository can affect multiple files. CloudCannon will pause Syncing for all files if one or more files have unsaved changes.
</comp.Notice>

Before you can save any changes to unaffected files, you must allow CloudCannon to resume Syncing by saving the files with incoming changes. For more information, please read our documentation on [resume Syncing](/documentation/articles/resume-syncing/).

### Example

Let's go through an example.

We want to update the copy on our About webpage, so we open the `about.md` file in CloudCannon and start making changes. Coincidentally, another team member is also updating the `about.md` file at the same time. Our team member is a developer who is fixing some broken [inputs](/documentation/articles/what-are-inputs/) on several webpages, including the About page, using their local development environment.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  There are two ways to edit the same branch without being on the same CloudCannon Site.

  One, you could connect the same branch to more than one CloudCannon Site. Normally, each branch in your Git repository is connected to one Site in CloudCannon. However, you can connect multiple CloudCannon Sites to a single branch if that suits your workflow (e.g., you have multiple websites in a single Git repository, or "monorepo").

  Two, you could edit the same branch using a CloudCannon Site, your local development environment, or directly through your Git provider simultaneously. It's common for content creators to use CloudCannon to update their website, while developers use their local development environment or Git provider.
</comp.Notice>

Before we can finish making our changes, our team member saves their changes to our website's Git repository. Our Git provider alerts CloudCannon that someone has updated several files and that CloudCannon should sync the new version of those files available on our Git repository to all connected CloudCannon Sites.

Because we have the About page open with unsaved changes, CloudCannon will pause Syncing notify us about the Syncing Conflict on the *Save* button and in the *Review changes* modal.

Before we can save any changes to other files or complete the sync to update all our files with incoming changes, we need to save or discard our changes to `about.md`. In this example, we want to save our unsaved changes and let CloudCannon complete the sync.
