Connecting Bitbucket allows you to work on your websites locally and have the changes sync to CloudCannon. File changes made on CloudCannon also get synced back to Bitbucket.

To connect a Bitbucket repository and start syncing files, follow these instructions:

1. Go to *Site Settings* / *Syncing*
2. Select **Bitbucket repository**
3. Click **Authenticate**

This redirects you to Bitbucket. Log in and authorize CloudCannon access to your Bitbucket account. You'll be redirected back to CloudCannon to pick a repository to connect. If you don't have one for this website, create a new one in Bitbucket and refresh this page.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Any existing files on your website will be replaced with the contents of the selected repository. Click **Backup and Sync** to continue, or exit the page to cancel the process.
</comp.Notice>

Bitbucket is now connected. Changes you push to the Git repository are pulled in by CloudCannon. Any changes made on CloudCannon are automatically committed and pushed.
