Multi-factor authentication (MFA) provides an extra layer of security to your CloudCannon account. By enabling MFA, you can require someone logging into your CloudCannon account to provide multiple forms of identity authentication before they can access your account.

Logging in with MFA enabled relies on something you know (your account password) and something you have (e.g., a device with your authentication app, a secure token, a biometric). This reduces the chances of someone else gaining access to your CloudCannon account.

## Third-party authentication apps

[Multi-factor authentication in CloudCannon](/documentation/articles/enable-multi-factor-authentication/) uses a third-party authentication app. Authentication apps generate one-time passcodes, which you can use to log in to CloudCannon. These passcodes regenerate often (normally every thirty seconds), meaning that someone trying to log in to your account would need the device with your authentication app to be successful.

Common authentication apps include:

* 1Password
* Authy
* Microsoft Authenticator

You should do your own research on these third-party apps and choose the one that is best for you.
