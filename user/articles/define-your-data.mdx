<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  As of October 2024, this documentation is only applicable to Sites using Unified Configuration.
  For Sites that have not migrated to Unified Configuration, please read the documentation on our [non-unified documentation website](https://non-unified.cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/define-your-data/).
</comp.Notice>

You can use data files and folders to populate your [Select and Multiselect](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-select-input/) inputs. Using a data file or folder to populate your value options is useful when you want your [team members](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-team-member/) to be able to edit the available options.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Data files/folders (i.e., `data_config`) are different to fixed data sets (i.e., `_select_data`).

  For more information about fixed data sets, please read our documentation on [Select and Multiselect inputs](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-select-input/).
</comp.Notice>

You can define your data files and folder in the [CloudCannon configuration file](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-the-cloudcannon-configuration-file/) under the `data_config` key.

To define a data file or folder:

1. Navigate to your CloudCannon configuration file.
2. Identify the `data_config` key at the root level of your configuration file, or add it if the key is not present.
3. Enter a key name for your data nested within the `data_config` key.
4. Add the `path` key within your data key and define the filepath to your data file or folder.
5. Save your changes.

Your data file or folder is now available for [Select and Multiselect](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-select-input/) inputs configured with this data key.

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
```

data_config___1___:
  authors:
    path___2___: data/authors.csv
  offices:
    path___3___: data/offices

```
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  Configure all data files or folders under the `data_config` key in your [CloudCannon configuration file](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-the-cloudcannon-configuration-file/).
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="2">
  Select and Multiselect inputs which use the `authors` key are populated by the contents of the `authors.csv` file.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="3">
  Select and Multiselect inputs which use the `offices` key are populated by the contents of each file in the `offices` folder.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

## Options

Your data configuration has the following options available:

<comp.DataReference>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="data_config" type_markdown="Object">
    This key defines which file or folder data in your Site is available to populate [Select and Multiselect inputs](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-select-input/).

    This key has no default.
  </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="data_config.[*].path" type_markdown="String">
    This key defines the file or folder path for the data key in which it is nested.

    The value for this key is relative to your [Site source](/documentation/articles/configuration-file-reference/#source). Each Collection must have a unique path.


    This key has no default.
