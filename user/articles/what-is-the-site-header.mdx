At the top of your Site is your <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/site-header.yml">Site Header</comp.GlossaryTerm> in gray. This UI element displays key information about your Site on the left, such as Site icon, name, branch, and project, and important tools on the right, including the *Avatar* list, <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/t/testing-domain.yml">Testing Domain</comp.GlossaryTerm>link, <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/c/configuration-mode.yml">Configuration Mode switch</comp.GlossaryTerm>, and <comp.GlossaryTerm term="/user/glossary/s/save.yml">Save button</comp.GlossaryTerm>.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Header-After-Build" alt="A screenshot of the Site Header shows the Site icon, name, branch, Avatar list, Testing Domain, and Save button." title="The Site Header" type="ui-snippet"/>

Some of these sections may not appear depending on your *Site's* configuration.

## *Site Header* sections

### Site details

On the left of your *Site Header* are your *Site* details, including the *Site Icon*, *Site Name*, *Branch*, and *Project* (if configured).

The *Site Icon* and *Site Name* enable you to identify the site you have open and help you distinguish between sites in the *Sites Browser*. The *Branch* tells you which branch of your Git repository this *Site* is connected to.

If your *Site* is part of a Project, the *Branch* and *Project* name will become a link. Clicking on the *Project* name will open the *Project pop-up*, allowing you to navigate to your *Project* page easily. For more information about the *Projects*, please read our documentation on [Projects](/documentation/developer-articles/create-a-project/).

### The *Avatar list*

The first tool on the right side of your Site Header in the *Avatar list* displays the avatars for any [team members](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-team-member/) active on your *Site*. Clicking on an avatar will display a list of files they have open, with an eye icon indicating files they are viewing and a pencil icon indicating files they are editing.

### The *Testing Domain link*

If your *Site* has a successful [build](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-a-site-build/), a link to your *Testing Domain* will appear in the *Site Header*. If you have a *Custom Domain* as well, the *Open URL dropdown* will appear instead, allowing you to choose which domain you want to open. For more information about hosting on a domain, please read our documentation on [Testing Domains](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-testing-domain/) and [Custom Domains](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-a-custom-domain/).

### The *Configuration Mode switch*

If you want to customize the appearance and functionality of your Site, you can turn on *Configuration Mode* using the *Configuration Mode switch* in the *Site Header*. This will reveal purple *Edit Configuration buttons* that enable you to add content to your *CloudCannon Configuration File*. For more information, please read our documentation on [Configuration Mode](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-configuration-mode/).

### The *Save* *button*

The *Save button* on the right of the *Site Header* allows you to save changes to your files. The *Save button* is also in the same place when you have any editing interface. For more information, please read our documentation on [Saving your Changes](/documentation/user-articles/save-your-changes/).
