A Testing Domain is a free *.cloudvent.net* URL that CloudCannon assigns to every Site. You can see your Testing Domain any time after your first successful [Site build](/documentation/developer-articles/what-is-a-site-build/).

To view the home page of your Site on your Testing Domain:

1. Open the Site you want to view in CloudCannon.
2. Click the *Live Site Preview* button the header of your *Site Navigation*.

CloudCannon will open the home page of your Site on your Testing Domain in another tab.
