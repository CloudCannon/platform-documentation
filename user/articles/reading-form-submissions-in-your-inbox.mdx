Once you have correctly added a form to your site, you can view responses in the CloudCannon inbox. The *Inbox* tab will show up under *Dashboards* in the sidebar.

You can view more details about each message by clicking it in your inbox.

Each form has a context menu that has contains more options. They can be opened by clicking the three dots in the top-right corner of each form.

## Boxes
Your inbox is organized into several boxes. These are located within the *Inbox* view near the top left of the screen. Below is a brief overview of each box:

* **Sent** - All messages that were sent through the inbox that were successfully sent.
* **Pending** - Messages that are currently in the process of sending and being processed.
* **Errored** - Messages that have failed to send. THis is for web hooks.
* **Spam** - Messages that were detected as soam by a spam filter.
* **All** - All of the above in one inbox.

### Spam
CloudCannon puts your form responses through a spam filter.  If a message is flagged as spam, it will be hidden from your **Sent** box. Spam messages can be viewed in the **Spam** box.

If you see a message here that is not spam, you can open the context menu for that message and select **Mark as not spam**. This will move the message from **S****pam** to **Sent**.

If  a spam message makes it into your inbox, open the context menu for that message and select **Mark as spam**.

Marking as spam or ham will help the spam filter get better at spam detection.

### Errored
Sometimes a form will fail to send. These will show up in the **Errored** box in the inbox. A common reason for errored forms is an incorrectly configured [webhook](/documentation/articles/creating-a-form-for-your-site-on-cloudcannon/#using-webhooks).

You can try and resolve the issue by resending the form. You can do this by opening the context menu for the desired message and selecting **Resend Message**.
