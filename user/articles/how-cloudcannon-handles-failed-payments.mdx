We realize credit cards sometimes decline for unknown reasons, so we try to give you plenty of time to try a new payment method. After a failed payment, we retry the payment four times over the next three weeks. If we’re still unsuccessful during this period, we will pause your subscription.

When your subscription is paused:

* You will not be able to edit your Sites through CloudCannon.
* Your hosted websites will be unavailable.
* You can create and download a backup of your Site files.

For any issues with billing, please reach out to [our support team](/support/). We're always happy to help.
