<comp.Notice info_type="permissions">
  **Permissions required**

  Members of the Owners or Developers [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/), or [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/) with the `base-domain:create` permission, can connect Custom Domains to an Organization.
</comp.Notice>

A Custom Domain is a unique address used to identify a website (e.g., [cloudcannon.com](https://cloudcannon.com/)). Once you have purchased a domain from a Domain Registrar, you can connect that Custom Domain to CloudCannon and use it on any Site in your Organization.

After you have connected a Custom Domain to your Organization, you can manage your Custom Domain settings and [add your Custom Domain to a Site](/documentation/articles/add-a-custom-domain-to-your-site/).

These instructions assume that you want to host your website through CloudCannon and know [which DNS provider is right for your Custom Domain](/documentation/articles/which-dns-provider-is-right-for-your-custom-domain/). For more information, please read our documentation on [web hosting](/documentation/articles/what-is-web-hosting/) and [DNS](/documentation/articles/what-is-dns/) in general.

There are two ways to connect a Custom Domain to your Organization: from the *Domains* *browser*, or from the *Custom Domain* page under your *Site Settings*.

## Connect a domain from your *Domains browser*

To connect a Custom Domain from the *Domains browser*:

1. Log in to CloudCannon and select the Organization to which you want to connect the Custom Domain.
2. Click the *Domains* button in the *App Sidebar*.  CloudCannon will open the *Domains browser*.
3. Click the *\+ Connect a Domain* button in the top right of the *Domains browser*. CloudCannon will open the *Connect a Domain* page.
4. Enter your Custom Domain name in the *Base Domain* text input.
5. Select the *CloudCannon DNS* or *External DNS* option under the *DNS Provider* radio buttons.
6. Click the *Connect Domain* button.

CloudCannon will connect the Custom Domain to your Organization and open the *Domain* page for this Custom Domain.

If you do not have at least one Custom Domain connected to your Organization, the *Domains* button in the *App Sidebar* will open the *Connect your first domain* page.

To connect a Custom Domain from the *Custom Domain* page under *Site Settings*:

1. Log in to CloudCannon and select the Organization to which you want to connect the Custom Domain.
2. Click the *Sites* button in the *App Sidebar*. CloudCannon will open the *Sites browser*.
3. Navigate to the *Custom Domain* page under *Site Settings*.
4. Click the *Base Domain* dropdown and select the *\+ Connect a Domain* option. CloudCannon will open the *Connect a Domain* modal.
5. Enter your Custom Domain name in the *Base Domain* text input.
6. Select the *CloudCannon DNS* or *External DNS* option under the *DNS Provider* radio buttons.
