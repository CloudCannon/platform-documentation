You can integrate your CloudCannon forms with your IFTTT applets using webhooks and the IFTTT Inbox target.

To create an IFTTT webhook:

1. If you haven't already, create an IFTTT account [here](https://ifttt.com/join).
2. In the IFTTT console, create a new applet by clicking the *Create* button.
3. Select the *Webhooks* service and then select *Receive a web request with a JSON payload* as your trigger.
4. Enter an event name and then click *Create Trigger*.
5. Add any actions you want to your applet, then click *Continue*. Give your applet a name and click *Finish.*
6. Navigate to *My Services &gt; Webhooks*, then click the *Settings* button.
7. Go to the URL listed under the *Details* heading. Here you'll find your webhook URL. Replace `{event}` in the URL with the event name you gave your trigger, the resulting URL is the one you'll use to create the IFTTT target.

To create an IFTTT target:

1. Navigate to the forms menu in your Organization settings, under *Hosting &gt; Forms.*
2. Open your Inbox settings by clicking the *Manage* button on the Inbox you want to connect to IFTTT.
3. Open the *Add new target* menu, and set the *Type* to *IFTTT.*
4. Set the *Target* to the webhook URL from your IFTTT webhook service, then click *Add Inbox target*.

Now if you submit to that Inbox, your applet will be triggered with the submission data.
