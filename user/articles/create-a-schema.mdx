<comp.Notice info_type="permissions">
  **Permissions required**

  Members of the Technical Editors, Developers, and Owners [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/), or [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/) with the `site:file:write` and `site:source-editor` permissions, can create a schema. You can limit permission to specific locations in the configuration using [file globs](/documentation/articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/#specify-a-file-glob).
</comp.Notice>

There are two steps to creating a schema: creating a schema file and referencing your schema in your collection configuration.

To create a schema file:

1. Navigate to the folder where you would like to store your schema using the file browser. We recommend creating a “Schemas” folder in your `.cloudcannon` folder.
2. Create a schema file with the same file extension as your collection files.
3. Add front matter and Markdown content to create a template.
4. [Save your file](/documentation/articles/save-your-changes/).

Here is an example of a schema file for an article:

<comp.CodeBlock language="Markdown" source=".cloudcannon/schemas/post.md">
```

---
title:
author:
image: /images/header.png
---
In this article, we will discuss...

```
</comp.CodeBlock>

To reference a schema in your collection configuration:

1. Navigate to your global configuration file and open it in the Source Editor.
2. Within the `collections_config` key, find the key for the collection where you want to reference this schema.
3. Identify the `schemas` key, or create one.
4. Add the path to your schema file under `default`, then `path`.
5. [Save your changes](/documentation/articles/save-your-changes/) to the global configuration file.

Here is an example schema configuration:

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
```

collections_config:
  articles:
    schemas:
      default:
        path: .cloudcannon/schemas/post.md

```
</comp.MultiCodeBlock>

The above code references the schema `post.md` from the collection `articles`. This schema will populate new collection files with the `title`, `author`, and `image` inputs. The image input already references an image path as part of the initial file contents. It will also start the Markdown content with the sentence: "In this article, we will discuss..."

Once you save the global configuration file, clicking the *\+ Add* button in the top right of your collection browser will show that schema as an option in the dropdown menu.

Here is how the new article looks in the Content Editor.

When you create a file using a schema, a hidden `_schema` input is added to the front matter of that file. This input is visible in the [Source Editor](/documentation/articles/the-source-editor/) but hidden in the sidebar of the Visual or Content Editor, and contains the name of the schema a file uses.

<comp.CodeBlock language="Markdown" source="post.md">
```

---
_schema: default
title:
author:
image: /images/header.png
---
In this article, we will discuss...

```
</comp.CodeBlock>

If you add a file to a collection with no schema referenced in the front matter, editing that file in an editing interface will add `_schema: default`
