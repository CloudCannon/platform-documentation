Site Sharing allows you to invite a [team member](/documentation/user-articles/what-is-a-team-member/) to view, edit, and publish content for a specific Site. With Site Sharing, you can control what a team member can interact with by limiting access to a single Site.

You can share an unlimited number of Sites to a team member.

When you add a team member to a Site in your Organization, CloudCannon will prompt you to add them to a [Permission Group](/documentation/user-articles/what-are-permission-groups/). CloudCannon provides two [Default Permission Groups](/documentation/user-articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/) per Site for Site Sharing, which have identical permissions to the [Technical Editors](/documentation/user-articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/#technical-editors) and [Editors](/documentation/user-articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/#editors) Groups except with a Site scope. These Permission Groups are named after the Site they allow access to.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  If you want to give someone access to all Sites in your Organization or give them more permissions than a Technical Editor, consider [adding them to a Global Permission Group](/documentation/user-articles/add-a-team-member-to-a-permission-group/).
</comp.Notice>

You can see a list of all the team members invited to a Site on the *Site Sharing* page under *Site Settings.*

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Settings-Site-Sharing-Page" alt="A screenshot of the Site Sharing page shows team members who have access to this site." type="screenshot" />

Site Sharing Permission Groups will appear under the *Groups* tab on the *Team* page if there is one or more members.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Team-Page-Groups" alt="A screenshot of the Groups tab on the Team page shows a list of Permission Groups." type="screenshot" />

Team members can see the list of Sites they have access to, [review their permissions](/documentation/user-articles/manage-my-permissions/#review-my-current-permission-groups), and [leave an Organization](/documentation/user-articles/manage-my-permissions/#leave-a-permission-group) through the *My permissions* page under *Org settings*.

## Site Sharing vs. Custom Permission Groups

Using Site Sharing, you can limit access to a single Site in your Organization. You can also achieve this with [Custom Permission Groups](/documentation/developer-articles/what-are-custom-permission-groups/).

With Custom Permission Groups, you can select which resources to add to each Group, define what actions are allowed for each resource (Read, Write, or Create), alter the scope of a permission, and add file globs and exceptions.

Custom Permission Groups can do everything Site Sharing does and more. For [Team and Enterprise customers](/pricing/), we recommend using Custom Permission Groups rather than Site Sharing for finer control over your content.
