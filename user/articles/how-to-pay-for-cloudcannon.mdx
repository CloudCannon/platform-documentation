### Payment Methods
We currently accept Visa and Mastercard credit cards for payment for paid plans and invoicing on Enterprise plans.

### Upgrading / Downgrading
When upgrading or downgrading your account, we perform the following actions:

1. Calculate the time left on your billing period on your current plan and credit this on your next invoice
2. Calculate the time left on your billing period on your new plan and debit this on your next invoice
3. On your next invoice, you will see these adjustments.
