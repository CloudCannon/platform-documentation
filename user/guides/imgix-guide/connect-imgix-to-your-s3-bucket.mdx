<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Earlier in this guide, you created two S3 users. In this step, make sure to use the *Access Key ID* and *Secret Access Key* from the "S3-to-imgix" user when you connect your Amazon S3 DAM to imgix.
</comp.Notice>

Although some integrations require your S3 bucket to be public, imgix does not. imgix connects to your DAM using the S3 user credentials created in the previous step, so you can keep your S3 bucket private.

For more information about connecting a source to imgix, please see their <a href="https://docs.imgix.com/getting-started/setup/creating-sources/amazon-s3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation</a>.

In this step, you will connect imgix to your S3 bucket.

1. Navigate to the <a href="https://dashboard.imgix.com/sources" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sources page</a> in the imgix dashboard.
2. Click the New Source button.
3. Select *Amazon S3* from the DAM options.
4. Click the *Continue* button.
5. Enter the *Access Key ID* and *Secret Access Key* from your IAM user in the *IAM Access Key* and *IAM Access Secret* fields, respectively. If you created two users earlier in this guide, select the keys from the "S3-to-imgix" user.
6. Enter the *Bucket Name* and the *Path Prefix*, if you created one.
7. Click the *Continue* button.
8. Enter a name in the *imgix Subdomain* field for your imgix Base URL. This must be globally unique and cannot be reused.
9. Click the *Deploy Source* button.
