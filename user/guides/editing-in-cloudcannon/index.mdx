Welcome to the Editing in CloudCannon guide!

This guide is perfect for anyone new to CloudCannon who wants to learn how to edit and update their website content.

CloudCannon makes it easy to edit your website files. Use one of CloudCannon's four *Editing Interfaces* to update your content files, add, delete, and move files to change your website structure, collaborate with your team members, and save your changes when you are ready for the content to go live.

In this guide, we'll cover how to:

* Find your files using the *Collection Browser* and the *File Browser*
* Use CloudCannon's *Editing Interfaces* to update your content
* Use file actions to add and delete content files
* Save your changes and see them live on your website

Before we begin, this guide assumes that you already have a *Site* set up in CloudCannon. If you haven't created a *Site* yet, check out our [Getting Started with CloudCannon](/documentation/developer-guides/getting-started-with-cloudcannon/) guide, or ask your developer to get started.
