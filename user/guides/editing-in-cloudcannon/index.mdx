Welcome to the Editing in CloudCannon guide!

This guide is perfect for anyone new to CloudCannon who wants to learn how to edit and update their website content. We'll walk you through everything step by step, assuming no prior knowledge.

CloudCannon is a tool that makes it easy to edit your website content, even if you've never worked with websites before. Think of it like a word processor for your website: you can update text, add images, create new pages, and make changes without needing to know how to code.

In this guide, we'll cover how to:

* Find your files using the *Collection Browser* and the *File Browser*
* Use CloudCannon's *Editing Interfaces* to update your content
* Use file actions to add, delete, and organize your content files
* Work together with your team members on the same files
* Save your changes and see them live on your website
* Publish your changes if your *Site* uses a branching workflow

Before we begin, this guide assumes that you already have a *Site* set up in CloudCannon and that you have permission to edit that *Site* (i.e., you are a member of the *Editors* *Permission Group* or higher). If you haven't created a *Site* yet or don't know what CloudCannon permissions you have, check out our [Getting Started with CloudCannon](/documentation/developer-guides/getting-started-with-cloudcannon/) guide, or ask your developer to get started.
