Welcome to the Editing in CloudCannon guide!

This guide is perfect for anyone new to CloudCannon who wants to learn how to edit and update their website content, whether you're a content creator, marketer, or team member who needs to make changes to your website.

CloudCannon makes it easy to edit your website files using intuitive editing interfaces, collaborate with your team members, and publish your changes to your website safely, so you can work with confidence.

In this guide, we'll cover how to:

* Find your files using *Collections* and the *File Browser*
* Use CloudCannon's *Editing Interfaces* to update your content
* Edit your files and make changes
* Save your changes and see them live on your website
* Add new files and delete files you no longer need

By the end of this guide, you'll be comfortable navigating CloudCannon, finding the files you want to edit, making changes, and saving those changes to your website.

Before we begin, this guide assumes that you already have a *Site* set up in CloudCannon. If you haven't created a *Site* yet, check out our [Getting Started with CloudCannon](/documentation/developer-guides/getting-started-with-cloudcannon/) guide, or ask your developer to get started.
