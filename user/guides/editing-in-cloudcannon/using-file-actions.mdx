Sometimes you will need to do more than edit the content of your files. You can use the tools in the *Context Menu* to perform a variety of *File Actions*. You can find the *Context Menu* in the top right of a *File Card* in your *Collection Browser*, or in the top right of the *Editing Interface Header*.

## Adding new files

There are several ways to add new files to your website in CloudCannon. The method you use depends on where you want to add the file and what type of file it is.

### Add a file to a Collection

The easiest way to add a new file is from the *Collection Browser*. Navigate to the *Collection* to which you want to add the file and click the *\+ Add* button in the top right of the *Collection Browser*.

/* TODO: Add DocShot showing the + Add button in the Collection Browser */

CloudCannon will add a new file to your *Collection*. The format of the file will either copy one of the existing files in your *Collection* or use a predefined template called a *Schema*. If you have multiple *Schemas*, the *\+ Add* button will open a dropdown menu so you can choose which one to use for your new file. If you would like to add, remove, or edit your *Schemas*, please speak with your developer.

/* TODO: Add DocShot showing the Add dropdown with template options */

Using the *\+ Add* button will immediately open your new file in an *Editing Interface*, ready for you to edit your content.

### Duplicate an existing file

If you want to create a new file that's similar to an existing one, you can duplicate it. Navigate to the file you want to duplicate using the *Collection Browser* or *File Browser* and open the *Context Menu* by clicking on the six dot icon in the top right of the *File Card*.

Select the *Duplicate* option from the *Context Menu*. CloudCannon will create a copy of the file with "-copy" added to the filename and open it in an *Editing Interface*.

/* TODO: Add DocShot showing the Duplicate option in the Context Menu */

We recommend you change the name of the file before you save it to your *Site*.

### Upload a file

If you have files on your computer that you want to upload to your website, you can upload them using CloudCannon.

Navigate to the location to which you want to upload the file using the *File Browser* and click the *\+ Add* button in the top right. Select the *Upload files* or *Upload a folder* option from the dropdown menu.

/* TODO: Add DocShot showing the Upload options in the File Browser */

Next, select the file or folder from your computer. CloudCannon will ask you to review the files in a confirmation modal, before you upload them to your *Site*.

CloudCannon will upload your files to the location you selected. You can also drag and drop files directly into the *File Browser* to upload them.

/* TODO: Add Notice component about file size limits for uploads */

## Deleting files

When you delete a file in CloudCannon, it doesn't happen immediately. Instead, CloudCannon marks the file for deletion, which gives you a chance to change your mind before you save the changes to your *Site*. We'll cover saving your changes more [later in this guide](/documentation/user-guides/editing-in-cloudcannon/saving-your-changes).

### Marking a file for deletion

To delete a file, navigate to the file you want to delete using the *Collection Browser* or *File Browser* and open the *Context Menu* by clicking on the six dot icon in the top right of the *File Card*.

Select the *Delete* option from the *Context Menu*. CloudCannon will mark the file for deletion the next time you save your changes.

/* TODO: Add DocShot showing the Delete item option in the Context Menu */

You can also mark a file for deletion from any *Editing Interface*. Open the *Context Menu* by clicking the three dots icon in the top right of the *Editing Interface Header*, then select the *Delete* option from the dropdown menu.

/* TODO: Add DocShot showing the Context Menu in the Editing Interface Header with Delete option */

When a file is marked for deletion, CloudCannon will display a banner at the bottom of the *Editing Interface* to let you know the file will be deleted when you next save your changes. The banner also includes a *Restore file* button if you change your mind.

/* TODO: Add DocShot showing the deletion banner in the Editing Interface */

### Restoring a deleted file

If you change your mind, you can restore any file that is marked for deletion. First, find the file with the *Deleted* badge. Then, open the *Context Menu*. Finally, select *Restore file*.

/* TODO: Add DocShot showing the Restore file option */

The *Deleted* badge will be removed, and the file will be restored. You can restore files any time before you save your changes.

### Files with unsaved changes

If a file has unsaved changes, you will need to discard those changes before you can mark it for deletion. This protects your work from being accidentally lost.

To discard unsaved changes, open the *Context Menu* for the file using the *Collection Browser* or an *Editing Interface*. Select the *Discard unsaved changes*. CloudCannon will ask you to review the action in a confirmation modal, before you discard those changes from your *Site*.

/* TODO: Add Notice component warning that discarding unsaved changes will destroy New files */

After discarding the changes, you will be able to delete the file.

## Rename a file

You can rename any file in CloudCannon to better reflect its content or to organize your files more effectively.

To rename a file, navigate to the file you want to rename using the *Collection Browser* or *File Browser* and open the *Context Menu* by clicking on the six dot icon in the top right of the *File Card*.

Select the *Rename* option from the *Context Menu*. CloudCannon will open a pop-up window where you can edit the filename.

/* TODO: Add DocShot showing the Rename option in the Context Menu */

/* TODO: Add DocShot showing the rename pop-up window */

Enter the new filename and click *Confirm* to save your changes. The file will appear in your *Collection Browser* or *File Browser* with both the old and new filenames until you save your changes. The file with the new name will have a *New* badge, and the file with the old name will have a *Deleted* badge.

You can also rename a file from any *Editing Interface*. Open the *Context Menu* by clicking the three dots icon in the top right of the *Editing Interface Header*, then select the *Rename* option from the dropdown menu.

/* TODO: Add DocShot showing the Context Menu in the Editing Interface Header with Rename option */

## Understanding file badges

CloudCannon uses badges on *File Cards* to help you keep track of which files have unsaved changes. These badges appear in your *Collection Browser* and *File Browser* to give you a quick visual indicator of each file's status.

/* TODO: Add DocShot showing file cards with different badges (New, Edited, Deleted) */

The *New* badge appears on files that you've created but haven't saved yet. This includes:

* Files you've added to a *Collection* using the *\+ Add* button
* Files you've duplicated
* Files you've uploaded
* Files you've renamed (the file with the new name will show a *New* badge)

The *Edited* badge appears on existing files that you've modified but haven't saved yet. This includes any changes you make to the file's content, whether you're editing text, images, structured data, or any other content.

The *Deleted* badge appears on files that you've marked for deletion but haven't saved yet. This includes:

* Files you've deleted using the *Context Menu*
* Files you've renamed (the file with the old name will show a *Deleted* badge)

We'll cover how to save your changes [later in this guide](/documentation/user-guides/editing-in-cloudcannon/saving-your-changes).

In the next step of this guide, we'll learn about editing sessions and how to collaborate with your team members.
