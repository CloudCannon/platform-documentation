Sometimes you will need to do more than edit the content of your files. You might want to add a new file, delete a file you no longer need, or make a copy of an existing file. You can use the tools in the *Context Menu* to perform these file actions. You can find the *Context Menu* in the top right of a *File Card* in your *Collection Browser*, or in the top right of the *Editing Interface Header*.

## Adding new files

You might want to add a new file when you're creating a new blog post, adding a new page to your website, or uploading an image or document. There are several ways to add new files to your website in CloudCannon. 

### Add a file to a Collection

The easiest way to add a new file is from the *Collection Browser*.

Navigate to the *Collection* to which you want to add the file and click the *\+ Add* button in the top right of the *Collection Browser*. CloudCannon will open a dropdown menu with the options to add files or *Create a new folder*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls-Add-Menu-Dropdown" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows the Add dropdown with template options." title="The Add dropdown" type="ui-snippet"/>

When you create a new file in the *Collection Browser*, CloudCannon will either copy the format of an existing file in your *Collection* or use a predefined template called a *Schema*. The default file format will often share the name of the *Collection* (e.g., the Blog *Collection* will have the *\+ Add Blog* option), but each *Schema* will have a different name. If you would like to add, remove, or edit your *Schemas*, please speak with your developer.

Clicking on an *\+ Add* option from this dropdown will create a new file, which CloudCannon will immediately open in an *Editing Interface*, ready for you to edit your content.

### Duplicate an existing file

If you want to create a new file that's similar to an existing one, you can duplicate it. Navigate to the file you want to duplicate using the *Collection Browser* or *File Browser* and open the *Context Menu* by clicking on the six-dot icon in the top right of the *File Card*. The *Duplicate* file action will be an option in the *Context Menu*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Edited-File-Context-Menu" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows the Context Menu is open for a file." title="The Collection Browser" type="screenshot"/>

You can also find the *Duplicate* option in any *Editing Interface* by clicking on the three-dot icon in the *Editing Interface Header* and opening the *Context Menu*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Content-Editor-Edited-File-Context-Menu" alt="A screenshot of the Content Editor shows the Context Menu is open for a file." title="The Content Editor" type="screenshot"/>

When you select the *Duplicate* option from the *Context Menu*, CloudCannon will create a copy of the file with "-copy" added to the filename and open it in an *Editing Interface*. We recommend changing the name of the file before saving it to your *Site*.

### Upload a file

If you have files on your computer that you want to upload to your website, you can upload them using CloudCannon.

Navigate to the location to which you want to upload the file using the *File Browser* and click the *\+ Add* button in the top right. Select the *Upload files* or *Upload a folder* option from the dropdown menu.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-File-Browser-Controls-Add-Menu-Dropdown" alt="A screenshot of the File Browser shows the Add dropdown with template options." title="The Add dropdown" type="ui-snippet"/>

Next, select the file or folder from your computer. CloudCannon will ask you to review the files in a confirmation modal before you upload them to your *Site*.

CloudCannon will upload your files to the location you selected. You can also drag and drop files directly into the *File Browser* to upload them.

## Deleting files

You might want to delete a file when you no longer need it, such as removing an old blog post or an outdated page. When you delete a file in CloudCannon, it doesn't happen immediately. Instead, CloudCannon marks the file for deletion, which gives you a chance to change your mind before you save the changes to your *Site*. We'll cover saving your changes more [later in this guide](/documentation/user-guides/editing-in-cloudcannon/saving-your-changes).

### Marking a file for deletion

To delete a file, navigate to the file you want to delete using the *Collection Browser* or *File Browser* and open the *Context Menu* by clicking on the six-dot icon in the top right of the *File Card*.

Select the *Delete* option from the *Context Menu*. CloudCannon will mark the file for deletion the next time you save your changes.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Context-Menu" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows the Context Menu is open for a file." title="The Collection Browser" type="screenshot"/>

You can also mark a file for deletion from any *Editing Interface*. Open the *Context Menu* by clicking the three dots icon in the top right of the *Editing Interface Header*, then select the *Delete* option from the dropdown menu.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Content-Editor-Context-Menu" alt="A screenshot of the Content Editor shows the Context Menu is open for a file." title="The Content Editor" type="screenshot"/>

### Restoring a deleted file

If you have marked a file for deletion, you can restore it at any time before you save your changes.

Navigate to the file with the *Deleted* badge and open the *Context Menu* by clicking the six-dot icon in the top right of the *File Card*. Select the *Restore file* option from the *Context Menu*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Deleted-File-Context-Menu" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows the Context Menu is open for a deleted file." title="The Collection Browser" type="screenshot"/>

You can also restore a file from any *Editing Interface*. Open the *Context Menu* by clicking the three dots icon in the top right of the *Editing Interface Header*, then select the *Restore file* option from the dropdown menu.

You can also click the *Restore file* button in the banner at the bottom of the *Editing Interface*.

/\* TODO: Add DocShot showing the deletion banner in the Editing Interface \*/

The *Deleted* badge will be removed, and the file will be restored.

### Files with unsaved changes

If a file has unsaved changes, you will need to discard those changes before you can mark it for deletion. This protects your work from being accidentally lost.

To discard unsaved changes, open the *Context Menu* for the file using the *Collection Browser* or an *Editing Interface*. Select the *Discard unsaved changes*. CloudCannon will ask you to review the action in a confirmation modal before you discard those changes from your *Site*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Context-Menu" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows the Context Menu is open for a file." title="The Collection Browser" type="screenshot"/>

You can also discard unsaved changes from any *Editing Interface*. Open the *Context Menu* by clicking the three dots icon in the top right of the *Editing Interface Header*, then select the *Discard unsaved changes* option from the dropdown menu.

<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Discarding unsaved changes will destroy new files and content.
</comp.Notice>

After discarding the changes, you will be able to delete the file using the option in the *Context Menu*.

## Rename a file

You might want to rename a file to better reflect its content, fix a typo in the filename, or organize your files more effectively.

To rename a file, navigate to the file you want to rename using the *Collection Browser* or *File Browser* and open the *Context Menu* by clicking on the six dot icon in the top right of the *File Card*.

Select the *Rename* option from the *Context Menu*. CloudCannon will open a pop-up window where you can edit the filename.

/\* TODO: Add DocShot showing the Rename option in the Context Menu \*/

/\* TODO: Add DocShot showing the rename pop-up window \*/

Enter the new filename and click *Confirm* to save your changes. The file will appear in your *Collection Browser* or *File Browser* with both the old and new filenames until you save your changes. The file with the new name will have a *New* badge, and the file with the old name will have a *Deleted* badge.

You can also rename a file from any *Editing Interface*. Open the *Context Menu* by clicking the three dots icon in the top right of the *Editing Interface Header*, then select the *Rename* option from the dropdown menu.

/\* TODO: Add DocShot showing the Context Menu in the Editing Interface Header with Rename option \*/

## Understanding file badges

CloudCannon uses badges on *File Cards* to help you keep track of which files have unsaved changes. These badges appear in your *Collection Browser* and *File Browser* to give you a quick visual indicator of each file's status.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-File-Card-Badges" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows file cards with different badges (New, Edited, Deleted)." title="File cards with badges" type="screenshot"/>

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-File-Card-Gallery-Edited-Badge" alt="A screenshot of a File Card with the Edited badge." title="File card with a badges" type="ui-element"/>

The *New* badge appears on files that you've created but haven't saved yet. This includes files you've added to a *Collection* using the *\+ Add* button, duplicated, uploaded, and renamed (the file with the new name will show a *New* badge).

The *Edited* badge appears on existing files that you've modified but haven't saved yet. This includes any changes you make to the file's content, whether you're editing text, images, structured data, or any other content.

The *Deleted* badge appears on files that you've marked for deletion but haven't saved yet. This includes files you've deleted using the *Context Menu* and files you've renamed (the file with the old name will show a *Deleted* badge).

We'll cover how to save your changes [later in this guide](/documentation/user-guides/editing-in-cloudcannon/saving-your-changes).

In the next step of this guide, we'll learn about editing sessions and how to collaborate with your team members.
