CloudCannon provides four different *Editing Interfaces*, each designed for editing different types of content. Understanding these interfaces will help you choose the best one for what you're trying to do.

When you click on a file in a *Collection Browser* or the *File Browser*, CloudCannon will open that file in one of CloudCannon's *Editing Interfaces*. Which *Editing Interface* CloudCannon will open by default depends on your file type and how your *Site* is configured.

## The *Editing Interface Header*

At the top of every *Editing Interface*, you'll find the *Editing Interface Header*, which provides helpful information and tools.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Editing-Interface-Header" alt="A screenshot of the Editing Interface Header shows tools including Return to Site, File details, Update status, Avatars, Interface buttons, Context Menu, and Save button." title="The Editing Interface Header" type="ui-snippet"/>

From left to right, this includes:

* The *Return to Site* button — Returns you to the *Collection Browser* or *File Browser* where you opened the file.
* Your *File details* — The name and Output URL (if applicable) of the file you are editing.
* The *Update status* indicator — This shows you when CloudCannon last recorded an update to your file.
* The *Avatars* List — This displays the avatars of any team members who have this file open. One avatar is highlighted to show who is currently editing the file.
* The *Interface* buttons — These allow you to switch between CloudCannon's four *Editing Interfaces*: the *Visual Editor*, *Content Editor*, *Data Editor*, and *Source Editor*. You'll see between two and four options depending on your file type and *Site* configuration.
* The *Context Menu* — Clicking on the three dots icon will show you several file actions like duplicating, renaming, deleting, and more.
* The *Save* button — This opens the *Save changes* modal, allowing you to review all your unsaved changes before saving them to your website.

On smaller screen sizes, some of these tools will collapse into the *Context Menu* to save space.

## The *Visual Editor*

The *Visual Editor* is the most intuitive way to edit your website. It allows you to edit your content directly on an interactive preview of your webpage. When you edit using the *Visual Editor*, you can see exactly what your visitors will see when they visit a webpage, and make editing decisions about your content in context. You can also navigate between pages by clicking links, just like on your live website.

The *Visual Editor* works best for files that output to a webpage. If your file doesn't create a webpage (like a data file), the *Visual Editor* won't be available for that file.

<comp.DocsVideo url="https://player.vimeo.com/progressive_redirect/playback/1124969057/rendition/1080p/file.mp4?loc=external&signature=18a05ed71665768fa94851c72a31cf574e4079284b8ce0579885d8f3b47c4a8d" title="The Visual Editor with editable regions" autoplay={true} loop={true}/>

In the *Visual Editor*, content that you can edit is marked with yellow boxes called *Editable Regions*. These yellow boxes show you exactly which parts of your webpage you can edit. When you hover over or click on an *Editable Region*, the border will turn green to help you see the boundaries of that region.

Clicking into an *Editable Region* will do different things depending on what type of content it contains:

* For text content, you can type directly on the page to edit the text. If it is rich text (as opposed to plain text), CloudCannon will also give you a formatting toolbar with options like bold, italic, headings, and lists.
* For image content, CloudCannon will open a Data Panel with options to replace the image or edit its properties like alt text and title.
* For arrays or lists, you'll see tools to add, remove, or reorder items.

You can also use the sidebar in the *Visual Editor* to edit structured data (also called front matter), which is the metadata that doesn't appear in the body content of your file. This could be your file title, a date, tags, or other information for your content. Each piece of structured data has an Input field in your sidebar. To edit your structured data, use the fields, buttons, and sliders in each Input. If you would like to add, remove, or change the Inputs in the sidebar, please talk to your developer.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Visual-Editor-Bookshop-Sendit-Home" alt="A screenshot of the Visual Editor displays a webpage preview on the right and a sidebar with input fields on the left." title="The Visual Editor" type="screenshot"/>

The *Visual Editor* does require some configuration, and may not be available for all file types. If you have any questions about using the *Visual Editor* for a specific file, talk to your developer or the friendly CloudCannon [support team](/support/).

## The Content Editor

The *Content Editor* is a rich text editor that's perfect for editing content-heavy files like blog posts, articles, or documentation. It provides a clean, distraction-free interface that focuses on your content.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Content-Editor" alt="A screenshot of a blog file open in the Content Editor." title="The Content Editor" type="screenshot"/>

You can type directly into the editor just like other rich text editors you might be familiar with (e.g., Google Docs or Microsoft Word). At the top of the *Content Editor* you will see the WYSIWYG toolbar, allowing you to format how the content should appear on your webpage (WYSIWYG is an acronym for What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get). This might include adding images, links, or Snippets, changing the alignment of your text, or simple tools such as bolding, italicizing, or underlining text.

To use these tools, click to place your cursor in the content area of the editor (or, in some cases, highlight your existing text) and then click the icon for the tool you want to use. The number of tools available in your WYSIWYG toolbar will depend on how your *Site* is configured.

/\* TODO: Add Notice component with the following text: *Snippets* are pre-built content blocks that you can add to your content with just a click. Think of them as reusable templates for common content types like testimonials, call-to-action sections, or product cards. Your developer sets up *Snippets* for your *Site*, so if you don't see any *Snippets* available or want to add new ones, talk to your developer. \*/

Just like the *Visual Editor*, you can use Inputs in the *Content Editor* sidebar to edit structured data.

## The *Data Editor*

The *Data Editor* is a simple interface for managing structured data. It's perfect for editing files that contain data like your website navigation menus, staff profiles, product details, or metadata. The *Data Editor* also appears as the sidebar in the *Visual Editor* and *Content Editor*, where it helps you manage the structured data (front matter) associated with your content files.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Data-Editor" alt="A screenshot of the Data Editor shows structured data fields organized in a simple list." title="The Data Editor" type="screenshot"/>

The *Data Editor* uses Inputs for each piece of structured data. To edit your structured data, use the fields, buttons, and sliders in each Input. If you would like to add, remove, or change the Inputs, please talk to your developer.

## The Source Editor

The *Source Editor* is an in-browser code editor that's great for making minor changes to the source code of your files. It displays the raw content of text-based files with automatic syntax highlighting based on the file extension. You can edit the content directly by typing, just like you would in any code editor.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Source-Editor" alt="A screenshot of the Source Editor shows the CloudCannon Configuration File in plain text with syntax highlighting." title="The Source Editor" type="screenshot"/>

The *Source Editor* is useful when you need to make small code changes or when you're comfortable working with raw file content. This *Editing Interface* is available to users with the Technical Editor [default Permission Group](/documentation/user-articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/) or higher. If you don't see the *Source Editor* as an option, you may not have the required permissions.

## Which interface should you use?

The best interface depends on what you're trying to do:

* Use the *Visual Editor* when you want to see your changes in context and edit directly on a preview of your webpage.
* Use the *Content Editor* when you're working with longer written content and want a focused, distraction-free editing experience.
* Use the *Data Editor* when you're working with structured data files or need to update metadata and settings.
* Use the *Source Editor* when you need to make small code changes or edit the raw source code of your files.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Some interfaces may not be available depending on your *Site's* SSG and configuration, or your permissions.
</comp.Notice>

Don't worry if you're not sure which interface to use; you can always switch between them. CloudCannon will remember your changes no matter which interface you use.

In the next step of this guide, we'll learn how to add, delete, rename, and duplicate files with file actions.
