Once you are happy with the changes you have made to your files, you can save them so they appear on on the Internet. Saving your changes in CloudCannon is straightforward, but it's helpful to understand how the process works.

## The Save button

As you make changes, you'll notice a red notification appear on the *Save* button in the top right of your *Editing Interface* and *Site Header*. The *Save* button notification shows you how many files have unsaved changes.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Save-Button-Unsaved-Changes-Notification" alt="A screenshot of the Save Button in the Site Header shows a notification of unsaved changes." title="The Save Button" type="ui-snippet"/>

Don't worry about saving after every single change. CloudCannon remembers all your edits, so you can make multiple changes across multiple files and save them all at once when you're ready.

## Why save your changes?

When you edit files in CloudCannon, your changes are stored temporarily until you save them. This means you can:

* Make multiple changes across different files
* Take breaks without losing your work, including closing the CloudCannon tab in your Internet browser
* Review all your changes before saving
* Work with your team on the same editing session

However, your changes won't appear on your live website until you save them. Saving your changes does two important things:

1. It creates a permanent record of your changes in your website's files (your developer can undo these changes, if necessary)
2. It triggers CloudCannon to rebuild your website, making your changes visible on your *Testing Domain* (your free preview URL) and any *Custom Domain* connected to your site

  It's important to save your changes regularly, as unsaved changes can prevent other updates to your site. We recommend saving after every editing session.
</comp.Notice>

## How to save your changes

Once you are finished making changes to your *Site* content, click the *Save* button in the top right of your *Editing Interface* or *Site Header*. A red notification on the *Save* button will show you how many files have unsaved changes.

CloudCannon will open the *Review changes* modal, which shows you all the files with unsaved changes, organized into two sections: *My changes* and *Other changes*. These sections help you identify which files you contributed to during the editing sessions, and which files only have unsaved changes from other team members.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Save-Changes-Modal-Multiple-Contributors" alt="A screenshot of the Review changes modal shows all files with unsaved changes, organized into sections." title="The Review changes modal" type="screenshot"/>

Review the list of files. Each file is represented by a *File Card* with the file name, *Collection*, which team members contributed to changes (shown as avatars), when the file was last updated, and a badge showing the type of change (*New*, *Edited*, or *Deleted*).

Select the files you want to save using the checkboxes in the top left of each *File Card*. By default, any files you contributed to will be selected. You can select or deselect individual files, or use the checkboxes under each section heading to select all files in that section.

Sometimes, your file might require you to fill in some information before you can save them (for example, if you did not add a file name). Also, if your developer has added validation rules to an Input in a file, you will need to make sure those Inputs have valid values before you can save. An example of Input validation might be that a Date field requires you to enter a publishing date on a blog, or a list of relevant links can only have a maximum of three items.

Some *Sites* have *Commit Messages* configured. A *Commit Message* is a note that CloudCannon will attach to the record of changes to your *Site*. You should use it to describe what you have changed, and why, for your team (or your future self). For example, "Updated the About page with new team member information" or "Added three new blog posts about new product features."

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Save-Changes-Modal-Commit-Message" alt="A screenshot of the Save Changes modal shows a Commit Message with fields for ticket number and subject." title="The Review Changes modal" type="screenshot"/>

Once you're happy with the files you have selected, have filled in all the fields required by your developer, and added any *Commit Messages*, click the *Save selected* button.

CloudCannon will update your *Site* using your changes, remove the *New*, *Edited*, and *Deleted* badges from your *File Cards*, add a permanent record of your changes in your website's files, and make your changes live on your *Testing Domain* (your free preview URL) and any *Custom Domain* connected to your site.

The save process usually takes just a few moments, but it may take longer for larger sites or when many files have changed. You can then continue editing while your *Site* is saving, or take a break knowing your changes are safe.

## What if you want to undo a saved change?

If you accidentally save a change you didn't mean to, or change your mind, you can always undo that change by re-editing your files and saving again. However, if you need to return to a version of your files that was several changes ago, or undo a large change that would be difficult to do manually, talk to your developer. Because CloudCannon has a permanent record of all your changes, your developer will be able to help you restore a previous version.

## View your changes live on the Internet

Once you save your changes, CloudCannon will rebuild your *Site* and update the content live on the Internet. You can see your live website using your *Testing Domain* or *Custom Domain*.

A *Testing Domain* is a free preview website that CloudCannon gives to every *Site*. Each *Testing Domain* uses a randomly generated adjective and noun separated by a hyphen (e.g., grey-grouse.cloudvent.net or brave-submarine.cloudvent.net). A *Custom Domain* is a custom website URL chosen by your developer (e.g., cloudcannon.com). Your *Custom Domain* may also be the URL your visitors or customers use to see your content on the Internet.

You can open your *Testing Domain* or *Custom Domain* in a new tab by clicking the URL on the right of your *Site Header*. CloudCannon will open your live website in a new tab.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Header-Tools-Post-Build" alt="A screenshot of the Testing Domain in the Site Header." title="The Testing Domain" type="ui-snippet"/>

If your developer has set up a publishing workflow for your *Site*, the *Testing Domain* allows you to see your changes live on the Internet without affecting your public website. We'll cover what you need to know about publishing workflows in the next step of this guide.
