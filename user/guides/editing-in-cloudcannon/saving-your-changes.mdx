Once you are happy with the change you have made to your files, you will want to save them so they appear on your live website. Saving your changes in CloudCannon is straightforward, but it's helpful to understand how the process works.

## The Save button

As you make changes, you'll notice the *Save* button appears in the top right of your *Editing Interface* and in your *Site Navigation*. The *Save* button shows you how many files have unsaved changes.

Don't worry about saving after every single change. CloudCannon remembers all your edits, so you can make multiple changes across multiple files and save them all at once when you're ready.

## Why save your changes?

When you edit files in CloudCannon, your changes are stored temporarily until you save them. This means you can:

* Make multiple changes across different files
* Take breaks without losing your work
* Review all your changes before saving
* Work with your team on the same editing session

However, your changes won't appear on your live website until you save them. Saving your changes does two important things:

1. It commits your changes to your Git repository, creating a permanent record of what changed
2. It triggers CloudCannon to rebuild your website, making your changes visible on your *Testing Domain* and any *Custom Domain* connected to your site

## How to save your changes

To save your changes:

1. Click the *Save* button in the top right of your editing interface, or in your *Site Navigation*. The *Save* button will show you how many files have unsaved changes.

2. CloudCannon will open the *Review changes* modal. This shows you all the files with unsaved changes, organized into sections.

3. Review the list of files. Each file card shows:
   * The file name and title
   * Which team members contributed to changes (shown as avatars)
   * When the file was last updated
   * A badge showing the type of change (*New*, *Edited*, or *Deleted*)

4. Select the files you want to save. By default, any files you contributed to will be selected. You can select or deselect individual files, or use the checkboxes by each section heading to select all files in that section.

5. If your *Site* requires it, fill in any required fields. Some files might need a title, date, or other information before they can be saved.

6. If your *Site* is configured to use commit messages, you can add a message describing your changes. A good commit message helps you and your team understand what changed and why.

7. Once you're happy with your selection, click the *Save selected* button.

CloudCannon will then:
* Commit your changes to your Git repository
* Rebuild your website
* Make your changes live on your *Testing Domain* and *Custom Domain*

The save process usually takes just a few moments, but it may take longer for larger sites or when many files have changed.

## Reviewing your changes

The *Review changes* modal is your opportunity to review everything before saving. This is especially helpful when:

* Multiple team members have made changes
* You've edited many files and want to make sure everything looks correct
* You want to save only some of your changes

You can see a preview of each file's changes in the file card. If you decide you don't want to save a particular file, you can deselect it or use the *Context Menu* on the file card to discard its unsaved changes.

## What if you make a mistake?

If you make a change you don't want to keep, don't worry! CloudCannon makes it easy to undo your changes:

* **Undo a single change**: If you just made a change and want to undo it, you can use your browser's undo function (usually Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z on Mac).
* **Discard all changes to a file**: If you want to discard all unsaved changes to a specific file, you can use the *Context Menu* (the three dots icon) in the *Editing Interface Header* and select *Discard unsaved changes*. This will revert the file back to its last saved state. You can also discard changes from the *Review changes* modal using the *Context Menu* on any file card.
* **Wait until you save**: Remember, your changes aren't saved until you click the *Save* button, so you can always close the file and come back to it later without saving.

/* TODO: Add DocShot showing the Context Menu with Discard unsaved changes option */

## What happens after saving

Once you've saved your changes, CloudCannon will:

* Remove the *New*, *Edited*, and *Deleted* badges from your file cards
* Update your Git repository with your changes
* Rebuild your website
* Show your changes on your live website

You can then continue editing, or take a break knowing your changes are safely saved.
