Now that you know how to find your files and edit them, let's look at how editing sessions work and how you can collaborate with your team members.

## Editing sessions

In CloudCannon, all your changes happen within an "editing session." An editing session starts when you or someone on your team makes the first change to any file, and it continues until someone clicks the *Save* button.

During each editing session, you can:

* Edit as many files as you want
* Switch between different *Editing Interfaces*
* Have multiple team members contribute to various files
* Take breaks, refresh your page, or close your browser — CloudCannon will remember all your unsaved changes

## Collaborating with team members

CloudCannon makes it easy to collaborate with your team. When someone opens a file, you'll see their avatar appear in the *Editing Interface Header* and over *File Cards* in the *Collection Browser*.

One person can edit a file at a time, while others can view the changes in real time. This means you can see what your teammate is editing as they make changes, which is great for reviewing content together or learning how to use CloudCannon.

If you are viewing a file while someone in your team is editing, CloudCannon will disable any Inputs in the *Editing Interface* while you're viewing. This means you can see the changes your team member is making, but can't make edits simultaneously.

You will also see a banner at the bottom of the *Editing Interface* showing who is currently editing the file, and a *Switch to editing* button. If you want to take over editing, you can click this button to switch from viewing to editing mode.

Collaboration is especially useful when:
* You want to review changes before they're saved
* Multiple people are working on different files at the same time
* You're learning how to use CloudCannon and want to watch someone else edit

In the next step of this guide, we'll cover how to save your changes and see them live on your website.
