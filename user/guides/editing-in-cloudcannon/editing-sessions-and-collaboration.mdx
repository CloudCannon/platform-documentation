Now that you know how to find your files and edit them, let's look at unsaved changes a little more.

## Editing sessions

In CloudCannon, all your changes happen within an "editing session." An editing session starts when you or someone on your team makes the first change to any file, and it continues until someone clicks the *Save* button.

During each editing session, you can 

* Edit as many files as you want
* Switch between different *Editing Interfaces*
* Have multiple team members contribute to various files
* Take breaks, refresh your page, or close your browser — CloudCannon will remember all your unsaved changes

## Collaborating with team members

CloudCannon makes it easy to collaborate with your team. When someone opens a file, you'll see their avatar appear in the *Editing Interface Header* and over *File Cards* in the *Collection Browser*.

<!-- TODO: Add DocShot showing avatars in the editing interface -->

One person can edit a file at a time, while others can view the changes in real time. If you are viewing a file while someone in your team is editing, any Inputs in the *Editing Interface* will be disabled while you're viewing, so you can see the changes but can't make edits.

You will also see a banner at the bottom of the *Editing Interface* showing who is currently editing the file, and a *Switch to editing* button.

<!-- TODO: Add DocShot -->

In the next step of this guide, we'll cover how to save your changes and see them live on your website.
