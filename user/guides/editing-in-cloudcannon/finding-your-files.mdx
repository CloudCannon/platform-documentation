CloudCannon provides two main ways to browse and find your files: the *Collection Browser* and the *File Browser*. The *Collection Browser* is available to all users, while the *File Browser* is available to [Technical Editors](/documentation/user-articles/what-are-default-permission-groups/) and higher.

## The *Collection Browser*

*Collections* are groups of related files that have a similar format, making it easy to find and organize your content. For example, you might have a Collection for your blog posts, another for your webpages (e.g., Home, About, or Contact), and another for your products.

Your *Collections* appear in the *Site Navigation* on the left side of your screen. Each *Collection* has a name and an icon to help you identify it quickly.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Navigation-Collections" alt="A screenshot of the Site Navigation shows links to the Collections on this Site, organized into groups." title="The Site Navigation" type="ui-snippet"/>

When you click on a *Collection*, CloudCannon opens the *Collection Browser*. At the top of the *Collection Browser*, you'll see the *Collection Header* with the collection name and any description or documentation link that's been configured.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows several file cards with previews of each file." title="The Collection Browser" type="screenshot"/>

The main area of your *Collection Browser* shows you all the files in that *Collection*, with each file displayed as a *File Card*. *File Cards* show you helpful information like your file title, an image preview (if available), and when the file was last updated.

Clicking on a *File Card* will open that file in one of CloudCannon's four *Editing Interfaces*. Clicking on the six dots in the top right of a *File Card* will open the *Context Menu*, containing several file actions. We'll cover these more in the next step of this guide.

Below the *Collection Header*, you'll find the *Collection Browser Controls* with several tools to help you find and manage your files:

* The *Sort* menu lets you change how your files are organized in the *Collection Browser*. You can sort alphabetically, by date created, by date modified, or by file size.
* The *View* menu lets you switch between different *File Card* types: *List* view, *Card* view, or *Gallery* view.
* The *Filter* text field lets you search for specific files by typing part of the file name.
* The *\+ Add* button lets you create new files or upload files to the *Collection*.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Controls" alt="A screenshot of the Collection Browser shows the Sort menu, View menu, and Filter text field controls." title="Collection Browser controls" type="ui-snippet"/>

## The *File Browser*

Unlike *Collections*, which group similar files together, the *File Browser* shows you all the folders and files in your *Site* using the same structure as your Git repository.

You can access the *File Browser* by clicking *File Browser* in your *Site Navigation* under the *Developer* heading.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-Site-Navigation-Developer" alt="A screenshot of the Site Navigation shows links to the File Browser and Site Settings." title="The Site Navigation" type="ui-snippet"/>

The *File Browser* is not visible to everyone. If you don't see the *File Browser* in your *Site Navigation*, you may not have the required permissions. Please [review your current Permission Groups](/documentation/articles/manage-my-permissions/) and contact your developer.

The *File Browser* also displays your files as *File Cards*, and you can use the *Sort* menu, *View* menu, and *Filter* text field to find the files you need.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="CloudCannon-Documentation-File-Browser" alt="A screenshot of the File Browser shows several folders and files in the same structure as the Git repository." title="The File Browser" type="screenshot"/>

One key difference is that the *File Browser* shows every file in your repository, including files that might not be part of any *Collection* and technical files for building the functionality and layout of your website (rather than the content).

## Which browser should you use?

Both *Collection Browser* and the *File Browser* are useful, and you'll likely use both depending on what you're trying to do.

* Use the *Collection Browser* when you want to work with a specific type of content, like all your blog posts or all your pages. *Collections* make it easy to see related files together.
* Use the *File Browser* when you need to find a specific file by its location in your repository, or when you're working with files that aren't part of a *Collection*, or technical files.

In the next step of this guide, we'll learn about CloudCannon's *Editing Interfaces* and how to use them to update your content.
