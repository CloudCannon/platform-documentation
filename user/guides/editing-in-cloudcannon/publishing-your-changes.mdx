Publishing workflows are an optional feature on CloudCannon. You can tell if your *Site* uses a publishing workflow by looking for the *Publishing* button in your *Site Navigation*. If your developer has not configured a publishing workflow for your *Site*, you can skip this page of the guide.

## What is a Publishing workflow?

Publishing workflows allow everyone on your team to work on their own copy of your website while protecting your public website from unreviewed content changes.

By setting up a Publishing workflow, you can:

* Make changes to your content on a copy of your *Site* and see what the changes look like on the Internet without impacting your public website.
* When you are ready, publish those changes to your public website, or ask for a review from a team member before publishing.

Because everyone can have their own copy of your *Site* in CloudCannon, you can work on different projects simultaneously (or you can have different *Sites* for different projects).

### Where does CloudCannon publish your changes?

### When do you need to publish vs just save?

Saving your changes allows you to commit them to a permanent record of your website's files managed by your developer (your developer can undo these changes, if necessary). It also allows you to see your changes live on your *Testing Domain*.

If you want your changes to go to your public website, or are ready for another team member to review them before they go to your public website, you can publish them.

If your site doesn't use publishing, saving is all you need to do.

## How to publish your changes

Before you can publish your changes, you must first save them. If you have unsaved changes, save them first using [the previous step](/documentation/user-guides/editing-in-cloudcannon/saving-your-changes/) of this guide.

Click the link to the *Publishing* page in your *Site Navigation*. CloudCannon will open the *Publishing* page, which has three tabs: *Summary*, *Changes*, and *Commits*. The *Changes* and *Commits* tabs let you see all saved changes on your *Site*, organized by file or by editing session.

The *Summary* tab will always have an information box in the centre that explains where CloudCannon will publish your changes. This information is mostly relevant to developers, but here is a quick overview.

First, you'll see the sentence "No changes available to publish" or "Changes available to publish" at the top of the box, depending on whether you have saved any changes to your *Site*. If you see the former sentence, you will need to save your changes before you can proceed with publishing.

Second, the subtitle "\[number\] commits from \[branch-name\] to \[branch-name\]" summarizes how many times you saved an editing session on your *Site*, and the name of the *Site* CloudCannon will publish them to.

Third, the link "Compare changes on \[Git provider\]" takes you to the permanent record of your website's files, managed by your developer, called a Git provider. You may not have access to this because your Git provider is a separate piece of software from CloudCannon.

Outside of the information box, the *Publishing* page will look slightly different depending on which *Publishing Mode* your developer configured for your *Site*: *Merge Immediately* or *Pull Request*.

### Merge Immediately

*Merge Immediately* is a *Publishing Mode* that lets you publish your changes to your *Publish Branch* immediately, without needing approval from another team member. This is great for small teams or for publishing changes quickly.

If your *Site* uses the *Merge Immediately* mode, the *Summary* tab will have a *Publish*.

When you are ready, click the *Publish* button. CloudCannon will publish your changes to your *Publish Branch*.

### Pull Request

*Pull Request* is a *Publishing Mode* that lets you submit your changes for review before publishing to your *Publish Branch*. This is good for larger teams or when you need content oversight to ensure quality or compliance.

If your *Site* uses the *Pull Request* mode, the *Summary* tab will include a Create Pull Request button and a few text fields for your request details.

<comp.DocShot docshot_key="" alt="" title=""/>

By default, CloudCannon will have a *Title* and a *Body* text field. Fill in these fields with information for the team member who will review your changes. This could be something like:

**Title:** Added new blog

**Body:** Wrote a new blog concerning our latest feature and updated other blog articles with crosslinks to the new blog.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Your developer may have set up custom fields for your *Pull Request*, rather than the standard *Title* and *Body*. You should still fill these in before publishing.
</comp.Notice>

When you are ready, click the *Create Pull Request* button. CloudCannon will send your *Pull Request* to your developer for review.

Once your developer has reviewed and approved your *Pull Request*, click the *Publish Pull Request* button. CloudCannon will publish your changes to your *Publish Branch*. Alternatively, if you change your mind about publishing your changes, you can click the *Close Pull Request* button.

## What happens after publishing

Once you've published your changes, CloudCannon will:

* Move your changes to your live website
* Rebuild your live website with the new changes
* Make your changes visible to visitors on your live website

You can then continue making more changes, or take a break knowing your changes are live on your website.
