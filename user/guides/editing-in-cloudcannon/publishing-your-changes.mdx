Publishing workflows are an optional feature on CloudCannon. You can tell if your Site* uses a publishing workflow by loooking for the *Publishing* button in your *Site Navigation*. If your developer has not configured a publishing workflow for your *Site*, you can skip this page of the guide.

## What is a Publishing workflow?

Publishing workflows allow you everyone on your team to work on their own copy of your website, and protect your public website from unreviewed content changes.

By setting up a Publishing workflow, you can make changes to your content on a copy of your *Site*, see what the changes look like on the Internet without impacting your public website and, when you are ready, publish those changes to your public website. Because everyone can have their own copy of your *Site* in CloudCannon, you can work on different projects simultaneously (or you can have different *Sites* for different projects).

## How to know if your site has publishing enabled

You can tell if your site has publishing enabled by looking at your *Site Navigation*. If you see a *Publish* button or link in your *Site Navigation*, your site uses a branching workflow and you can publish your changes.



If you don't see a *Publish* button, your site doesn't use publishing, and you can skip the rest of this page.

## How to publish your changes

Before you can publish your changes, you must first save them. Publishing only works with saved changes, not unsaved changes.

Make sure you've saved all the changes you want to publish. If you have unsaved changes, save them first using the steps in [the previous page](/documentation/user-guides/editing-in-cloudcannon/saving-your-changes/).

Click the *Publish* button in your *Site Navigation*. CloudCannon will open the *Publishing* page, which shows you all the saved changes that are ready to be published to your live website.

Review the changes you want to publish, then click the *Publish* button on the *Publishing* page. CloudCannon will publish your changes to your live website. The process usually takes just a few moments.

## Understanding publish modes

Your site might be configured to use one of two publish modes:

**Merge immediately** — Your changes are published to your live website right away, without needing approval from anyone else. This is great for small teams or when you want to publish changes quickly.

**Pull request** — Your changes are submitted for review before being published. Someone else on your team needs to approve your changes before they go live. This is useful when you want to review changes before they appear on your live website.

You don't need to choose the publish mode—your developer has already configured this for your site. If you're not sure which mode your site uses, you can check the *Publishing* page or ask your developer.

## What happens after publishing

Once you've published your changes, CloudCannon will:

* Move your changes to your live website
* Rebuild your live website with the new changes
* Make your changes visible to visitors on your live website

You can then continue making more changes, or take a break knowing your changes are live on your website.

## When do you need to publish vs just save?

Here's a simple way to think about it:

* **Save** — Makes your changes visible on your test site (your *Testing Domain*). Always do this first.
* **Publish** — Makes your saved changes visible on your live website. Only needed if your site uses a branching workflow.

If your site doesn't use publishing, saving is all you need to do. Your changes will appear on your live website automatically after saving.

If your site does use publishing, you'll need to both save and publish:
1. Save your changes to make them visible on your test site
2. Publish your changes to make them visible on your live website
