This approach separates all languages, which can make it easier to find specific files. More configuration entries are required, however, resulting in a longer site navigation.

Hugo calls this [Translation by content directory](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#translation-by-content-directory). Your files will be placed inside a top-level content folder for each language (e.g. `content/es/posts/my-post.md`).

The best practice here is to **define a collection per language and folder of related files** (e.g. Pages EN, Pages ES, Pages FR, Posts EN, Posts ES, Posts FR).

Here's an example with Pages and Posts:

<comp.Tree>
```
content/
>> en/
   >> about.md
   >> blog/
      >> first-post.md
>> es/
   >> about.md
   >> blog/
      >> first-post.md
>> fr/
   >> about.md
   >> blog/
      >> first-post.md
```
</comp.Tree>

<comp.MultiCodeBlock language="YAML" translate_into={["json"]} source="cloudcannon.config.yml">
```
collections_config:
  pages_en:
    name: Pages EN
    icon: wysiwyg
    path: content/en
    parse_branch_index___1___: true
    filter___2___: strict
  pages_es:
    name: Pages ES
    icon: wysiwyg
    path: content/es
    parse_branch_index___1___: true
    filter___2___: strict
  pages_fr:
    name: Pages FR
    icon: wysiwyg
    path: content/en
    parse_branch_index___1___: true
    filter___2___: strict
  posts_en:
    name: Posts EN
    icon: event_available
    paths: content/en/blog
  posts_es:
    name: Posts ES
    icon: event_available
    paths: content/es/blog
  posts_fr:
    name: Posts FR
    icon: event_available
    paths: content/fr/blog
```
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  The `parse_branch_index` option is specific to Hugo sites on CloudCannon, and affects what collection `_index.*` files get assigned to.
  By default these files do not get assigned to the closest collection, as they usually represent the landing pages of your site.
  As such, they will be assigned to the global `pages` collection unless otherwise configured.

  If a collection is tagged as `parse_branch_index: true`, any `_index.*` files in the collection path (and subdirectories) will be assigned
  to it.
  
  In this case, we want the `content/*/blog/_index.md` files to be in the `pages_*` collection for their language,
  rather than in the global `pages` collection, or the inner `posts_*` collection.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="2">
  When you browse a collection in CloudCannon, all files within that folder will be shown by default. 
  Applying the `strict` filter to a collection instead limits the UI to show only the files that exactly match that collection.

  In this case, it prevents files from the `posts_*` collections in the `content/*/blog/` subdirectories
  from appearing when browsing the `pages` collection for that language.
