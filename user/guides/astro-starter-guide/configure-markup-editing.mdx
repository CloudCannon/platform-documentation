    In a previous section of this guide, we talked about the Visual Editor â€” an intuitive way to edit your site by clicking directly on a preview of your page. But how do you make each region editable in the Visual Editor?

    ### Bookshop

Using Bookshop, your team can update the front matter of each page component in the Visual Editor.
