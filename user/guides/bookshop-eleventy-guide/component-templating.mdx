Bookshop components use the templating language of your chosen static site generator.
For Eleventy, Bookshop supports writing components as `.liquid` files.

## Creating your first component

If you followed the previous [Getting set up](/documentation/guides/bookshop-eleventy-guide/getting-set-up/) section of this guide
and ran the `@bookshop/init` command, a sample component will have been created for you:

<comp.Tree>
```
_component-library/
>> components/
   >> sample/
      >> sample.bookshop.yml
      >> sample.scss
      >> sample.eleventy.liquid
```
</comp.Tree>

Bookshop components live in the `components/` directory, each inside a folder matching their name.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Bookshop supports multiple SSG targets, so to reduce conflicts each SSG is namespaced. This is why your component files will
  be `.eleventy.liquid`, rather than `.liquid`.
</comp.Notice>

For now, we're going to ignore the `.scss` and `.bookshop.yml` files and just look at the `.eleventy.liquid` templating file.
If you don't have this component, create an empty file at `components/sample/sample.eleventy.liquid` in your Bookshop folder.

If we look inside the sample file that was created for us, we'll see:

<comp.CodeBlock language="liquid" source="components/sample/sample.eleventy.liquid">
```
<div class="c-sample">
  <p>{{ text }}</p>
</div>
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

If you're used to writing Liquid includes on your Eleventy site, the contents of this component should be very familiar.
Beyond the special directory structure that this component should live in, the templating can _(in most cases)_ be migrated directly
from any existing Eleventy includes.

Here's a hypothetical component that uses more Liquid syntax:

<comp.CodeBlock language="liquid" source="components/hero/hero.eleventy.liquid">
```
<div class="c-hero">
  <p class="date">Published on {{ publish_date | date: '%a, %b %d, %y' }}</p>
  <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
  {% if subtitle %}
    <h2>{{ subtitle }}</h2>
  {% endif %}
</div>
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

## Scaffolding new components

The `@bookshop/init` command also provides a way to create new components:

<comp.CodeBlock language="bash" source="Command line">
```
npx @bookshop/init --component <name>
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Running the above command in an existing Bookshop will scaffold out some initial component files for you.

## Supported templating filters and functions

There are some restrictions on the features you can use inside your components.
Since Bookshop renders your components in the browser, any custom filters you define in your `.eleventy.js`
configuration won't be available. 

Any filters that are defined in the [LiquidJS Filter documentation](https://liquidjs.com/filters/overview.html) will be available,
and Bookshop also provides working `markdownify`, `slugify`, and `url` filters that match Eleventy's default logic.

Bookshop only has access to the files in your component browser when live editing, so accessing any of your
Eleventy includes from within a component will cause an error in the Visual Editor. If these need to be accessed,
turn them into Bookshop components, or use Bookshop's [bookshop_include](/documentation/guides/bookshop-eleventy-guide/page-building/#bookshop-includes) feature.
