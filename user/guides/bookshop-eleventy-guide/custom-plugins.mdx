Bookshop allows you to specify custom Liquid plugins to extend the live editing interface. For example,
custom tags and plugins can be defined to allow your components to render in the Visual Editor.

There are some limitations here â€” for example, plugins that interact with the filesystem or network will not work.
In these cases, providing Bookshop a fallback plugin can be enough to unblock your components in the Visual Editor.

## Configuring plugins

Plugins be specified in your Bookshop configuration file:

<comp.CodeBlock language="javascript" source="bookshop/bookshop.config.cjs">
```
module.exports = {
    engines: {
        "@bookshop/eleventy-engine": {
            "plugins": ["./custom-plugin-one.js", "./custom-plugin-two.js"]
        }
    }
}
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

The paths specified here should be a path to each plugin file, relative to the `bookshop.config.cjs` file.

## Writing plugins

Plugins defined for Eleventy target LiquidJS.
See the LiquidJS documentation on [Registering Filters/Tags](https://liquidjs.com/tutorials/register-filters-tags.html) for in-depth instructions.

Each plugin file should export a function that takes a `Liquid` argument, which gives you access to configure the LiquidJS instance as required.

## Example custom LiquidJS filter

<comp.CodeBlock language="javascript" source="bookshop/custom-filter.js">
```
import yaml from "js-yaml";

module.exports = function (Liquid) {
    this.registerFilter("load_yaml", (text) => {
        return yaml.load(text)
    });
}
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

This example also includes pulling in a dependency.
This dependency should be installed in the working directory, likely the root of your repository.
Any dependencies referenced must support being bundled for web targets, so packages that rely on NodeJS APIs will not work here.
