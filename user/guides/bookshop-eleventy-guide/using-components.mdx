Using a Bookshop component on your Eleventy site is very similar to using a regular Liquid include, with a few small differences.

## The Bookshop tag

The Bookshop plugin provides a `bookshop` tag for use in your layouts.

If you've been following along with this guide, add the following snippet
to a layout to use the sample component we created:

<comp.CodeBlock language="markdown" source="_includes/layouts/base.liquid">
```
...

{% bookshop "sample" text: "Hello from the sample component" %}

...
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

This component matches the syntax of the standard Liquid include, but takes a Bookshop component name rather than a file path.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  The Bookshop name of a component is the path to its directory.
  The name for `components/sample/sample.eleventy.liquid` is `sample`,
  and the name for `components/generic/button/button.eleventy.liquid` would be `generic/button`.
</comp.Notice>

There are no limitations on referencing Bookshop comonents from other components â€” the `{% bookshop %}` tag can be used anywhere
on your site or in your components.

## Bookshop's bind syntax

Often when working with Bookshop components your data will live in a front-matter object, with all keys passed through.
This might end up looking like:

<comp.CodeBlock language="markdown" source="page.liquid">
```
---
hero:
  title: Hello World
  subtext: My page hero contents
  image: /image.png
---

{% bookshop "hero" title: hero.title subtext: hero.subtext image: hero.image %}

```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Passing through each key can quickly become unwieldy. To help with this, Bookshop provides
the bind attribute:

<comp.CodeBlock language="markdown" source="page.liquid">
```
---
hero:
  title: Hello World
  subtext: My page hero contents
  image: /image.png
---

{% bookshop "hero" bind: hero %}

```
</comp.CodeBlock>

This functions similar to the spread operator in JavaScript, passing all
object keys as props to the component.

## Rendering dynamic components

The Bookshop tag supports interpolating Liquid, so if you have your component name in a variable you can use:

<comp.CodeBlock language="markdown" source="page.liquid">
```
---
components:
  - _bookshop_name: hero #1
    title: Hello World
    subtext: My page hero contents
    image: /image.png
---

{% for component in components %}
  {% bookshop "{{component._bookshop_name}}" bind: component %}
{% endfor %}

```
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  Later in this guide we'll cover creating CloudCannon Structures from your Bookshop components.
  When doing do, the generated Structures will automatically include this `_bookshop_name` value for you to use.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>

## Passing Data to Bookshop Components

In order to live edit Bookshop components, Bookshop needs a clear path between a component
and the data it draws from. 

In general, you should avoid adding logic around your Bookshop components in your
site layouts, and instead move that logic into a Bookshop component or helper.

For example:
<comp.CodeBlock language="markdown" source="page.liquid">
```
---
hero_text: "Hello World"
---
{% bookshop 'hero' text: hero_text %} <!--1-->

{% assign my_title = hero_text %}
{% bookshop 'hero' text: my_title %} <!--2-->
```
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  This component can make the connection between the `text` prop and the page's front matter,
  and will work as expected in the visual editor.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="2">
  This component doesn't have the context to find the origin of the `text` prop,
  and will error in the visual editor.  
  _(Reassignments **inside** Bookshop components will work correctly)._
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>
