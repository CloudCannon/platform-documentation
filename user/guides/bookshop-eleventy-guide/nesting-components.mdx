The Bookshop `blueprint` of your component config can help configure
some advanced Structure use-cases on CloudCannon.

## Nesting components

Your blueprint can reference other components and Structures, which will embed their structured data within.
For example, this saves you from having to re-define the required inputs if your `hero` component
contains an editable `button` component â€” using component nesting your blueprint might look like:


<comp.CodeBlock language="yml" source="hero.bookshop.yml">
```
blueprint:
  hero_text: Hello World
  button: bookshop:button #1
```
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  This is a string, and could also be written `button: "bookshop:button"`.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>

In this example, the button key will become an Object Structure containing the values specified in your button component blueprint.
If you desired an array of buttons, you could use the following:

<comp.CodeBlock language="yml" source="hero.bookshop.yml">
```
blueprint:
  hero_text: Hello World
  buttons: #1
    - bookshop:button
```
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  Or more concisely, `buttons: [bookshop:button]`
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>

In general, any `bookshop:<component_name>` string will be replaced with the structure of that component,
and will allow editors to add and remove that component.

## Nesting a set of components

If you're creating a layout component, you likely want to support a set of components.
For this, you can reference the keys we defined in `spec.structures`:

<comp.CodeBlock language="yml" source="section.bookshop.yml">
```
blueprint:
  section_label: My Section
  header: bookshop:structure:content_blocks #1
  inner_components: [bookshop:structure:content_blocks] #2
```
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  The `header` key will become a single component that can be selected from the set of components tagged as `content_blocks`
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="2">
  The `inner_components` key will become an array that can contain any components tagged as `content_blocks`
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>

## Nesting Example

To give a concrete example, let's say we have an example `hero` component:

<comp.CodeBlock language="yml" source="hero.bookshop.yml">
```
spec:
  structures: [content_blocks]

blueprint:
  hero_text: Hello World
  cta_button: bookshop:button
  column_components: [bookshop:structure:content_blocks]
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Then our matching component template file might look like:

<comp.CodeBlock language="liquid" source="hero.eleventy.liquid">
```
<div class="hero">
  <h1>{{ hero_text }}</h1>
  {% if cta_button %} <!--1-->
    {% bookshop "button" bind: cta_button %}
  {% endif %}
  {% for component in column_components %}
    {% bookshop "{{ component._bookshop_name }}" bind: component %}
  {% endfor %}
</div>
```
<comp.Annotation number="1">
  Object Structures in CloudCannon may be empty, as the component can be removed and replaced, so your template should check for the existence of this component.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>

## Initializing Nested Components

By default, nested components using the `bookshop:*` shorthand will be initialized empty. For example, the blueprint:

<comp.CodeBlock language="yml" source="hero.bookshop.yml">
```
blueprint:
  hero_text: Hello World
  button: bookshop:button
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Will be initialized in CloudCannon as:

<comp.CodeBlock language="yml" source="page.md">
```
  - _bookshop_name: hero 
    hero_text: Hello World
    button:
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Where the `button` input will provide an editor with the option to add a button component.
To instead have the button component exist on creation, you can use the syntax `bookshop:button!`:

<comp.CodeBlock language="yml" source="hero.bookshop.yml">
```
blueprint:
  hero_text: Hello World
  button: bookshop:button!
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

The same setting can be applied to a structure shorthand by specifying the component that should be initialized.
Taking the following example:

<comp.CodeBlock language="yml" source="section.bookshop.yml">
```
blueprint:
  section_label: Hello World
  column_components:
    - bookshop:structure:content_blocks!(hero)
    - bookshop:structure:content_blocks!(button)
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

This will be initialized in CloudCannon as:

<comp.CodeBlock language="yml" source="page.md">
```
  - _bookshop_name: section 
    section_label: Hello World
    column_components:
      - _bookshop_name: hero
        # ... hero fields
      - _bookshop_name: button
        # ... button fields
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

Where `column_components` can be then further added to/removed from by an editor,
using components from the tagged structure.
