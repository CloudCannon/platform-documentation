Next, we'll enable SAML authentication on your CloudCannon-hosted Site using the details from the previous step.

1. Log in to [CloudCannon](https://app.cloudcannon.com/) and open your Site.
2. Navigate to the *Authentication* page under *Site Settings*.
3. Click on the *Authentication method* dropdown and select the *SAML* option.
4. Click the *Switch to SAML authentication* button to confirm your choice.
5. Enter the SAML certificate details:
   * Enter the *SSO URL* in the *SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP)* text field.
   * Leave the *Issuer Suffix* field blank.
   * Enter the IdP certificate in the *X.509 Certificate* text field. Alternatively, you can click the *Fill cert using XML Metadata*  button to upload the certificate.
6. Click the *Update SAML Configuration* button.

CloudCannon will now redirect visitors to your Google Workspace login page.

Congratulations! Your site is now secured with Google authentication. Only members of your Google Workspace organization can access it. Test the setup by visiting your site and attempting to log in.

If you need any help with this setup, please contact our friendly [support team](/support/).

But what if you have a website that needs authentication for some pages (e.g., a Staff Only section) and leaves other pages publicly accessible? In the next step of this guide, we'll show you how to configure authenticated routes for your CloudCannon-hosted website.
