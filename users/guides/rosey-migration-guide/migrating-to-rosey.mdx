If you’re starting from scratch, have a look at the [Rosey documentation](https://rosey.app) to get set up, then move on to the next step.

If your site is already setup for i18n on CloudCannon, migrating to Rosey is easy. 

## Migrating your site

1. Initialize NPM on your site with `npm init` if you haven’t already
2. Install Rosey with `npm install rosey`
3. Rename your `_locales` directory to `rosey/locales` and convert each file to JSON.
4. Add a `rosey.yml` file with some basic configuration:
    
<comp.CodeBlock language="yml" source="rosey.yml">
```
source: "path/to/your/built/site" # e.g. _site
tag: "data-i18n" # the attribute you've tagged your translatable elements with
```
</comp.CodeBlock>
    
5. At this point, you can already start testing locally. Run `npx rosey build --serve` and see your translated site running on a local server.
