    Let's take a tour of CloudCannon!
  </comp.SlotContent>
  <comp.SlotContent name="Site-Navigation-tour">
    Your *Site Navigation* is the gray sidebar on the left of the app, next to your *App* *Navigation*. The *Site Navigation* sidebar contains information and tools you will use often.

    <comp.DocsImage path="" alt="" title=""/>

    Your *Site Navigation* contains:

    * **Projects dropdown** — If your Site is part of a [Project](/documentation/articles/create-a-project/), the *Projects dropdown* shows you which Project your Site belongs to and which Sites (if any) it publishes to.
    * **Site icon, Site name, and branch name** — These are your basic Site details, so you know which Site you are editing.
    * **Avatars** — The avatars for any team members active on your Site. Clicking on an avatar will show a list of files they have open, with an eye icon for file they are *Viewing* and a pencil for *Editing*.
    * **The Save button** — Opens the *Review your changes* modal and allows you to commit changes to your Git repository.
    * **The Publish button** — If your Site has a [Publish Branch](/documentation/articles/connect-a-publish-branch/), this button allows you to create a Pull Request or immediately merge your changes from this Site to any Sites it publishes to.
    * **Site Dashboard** — Your Site home page, showing recent activity on your Site.
    * **Collections** — Groups of related content, such as a folder of blog articles, Staff Member profiles, or product pages.
    * **Developer Tools** — Tools for managing your Site, including the *Status* page, file browser, and *Site Settings*.
  </comp.SlotContent>
  <comp.SlotContent name="Dashboard-tour">
    The *Dashboard* is the first item below the *Site Navigation* header. You Dashboard is the first place you arrive when you open a Site in CloudCannon and gives you and overview of your Site.

    <comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/guides/getting-started/2024-09/CloudCannon-Documentation-Dashboard-Summary-Tab-Headless.png" alt="A screenshot of the Summary tab on the Dashboard page shows recently opened files and recent activity." title="The Dashboard Summary tab" type="screenshot"/>

    There are two tabs on your Dashboard: *Summary*, and *Activity*.

    On the *Summary* tab you'll find buttons to open the *Publishing* page and recently opened files, and a list of recent activity on your Site.

    On the *Activity* tab you'll find more paginated activity in reverse chronological order for every change to your content or settings.

    <comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/guides/getting-started/2024-09/CloudCannon-Documentation-Dashboard-Activity-Tab-Headless.png" alt="A screenshot of the Activity tab on the Dashboard page shows all recent activity." title="The Dashboard Activity tab" type="screenshot"/>
  </comp.SlotContent>
  <comp.SlotContent name="Collections-tour">
    All your [Collections](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-collection/) are the are listed in your *Site Navigation*. We encountered Collections in the configuration file section of this guide, but if you need a reminder, a Collection is a group of related content (e.g., a folder of blog article or product descriptions).

    <comp.DocsImage path="https://cc-dam.imgix.net/documentation/images/guides/getting-started/2024-09/CloudCannon-Documentation-Collection-Browser-Headless.png" alt="A screenshot of the Collections browser shows a file card for each blog in the Articles folder." title="The Collection browser" type="screenshot"/>

    Clicking a Collection in your *Site Navigation* will open the Collection browser. Every file in that collection is represented here by a [file card](/documentation/articles/configure-your-card-previews/), with a name and metadata for that file. Clicking on a file will open it in one of CloudCannon's editing interfaces.

    In Headless Mode, CloudCannon cannot generate preview images of your files (this normally happens at build time). If you don't want to see the "No preview available" placeholder on your files, you can configure your file cards for each Collection.

    We'll cover how to configure your Collections further later in this guide.
  </comp.SlotContent>
  <comp.SlotContent name="Developer-Tools-tour">
    Under the *Developer Tools* heading you will find links to the *Status* page, the file browser, and *Site Settings*.

    You're already familiar with the *Status* page — it's been your home for onboarding so far! There are two tabs on the *Status* page: *Summary* and *Syncs*.

    The *Summary* tab has a *Needs Attention* notice if CloudCannon detects an issue with your Site configuration, a *Suggestions* section for how to configure your Site, and a link to Support. Your most recent Sync and Build are on the right of the page. The *Syncs* tab shows more logs in reverse chronological order.

    The *Files* item in your *Site Navigation* will open your file browser. This browser shows all the source files for your Site, using the same file structure as your Git repository.

    The *Site Settings* page is where you will find all your CloudCannon settings. These include your settings for your files, builds, hosting, sharing, and more.

    Developer tools are important for managing your Site beyond just it's content. These pages are only available to team members with specific permissions. We'll cover permissions and Permission Groups in the Collaboration section of this guide.
  </comp.SlotContent>
  <comp.SlotContent name="Visual-Editor-tour">
    <comp.Notice info_type="important">
      The Visual Editor is not available in Headless Mode.
    </comp.Notice>

    [The Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/the-visual-editor/) is the most intuitive way to edit content in CloudCannon, using an interactive preview of your site. You can navigate your pages as you would on your live site and edit directly onto the page.

    <comp.DocsVideo url="https://player.vimeo.com/progressive_redirect/playback/949770947/rendition/1080p/file.mp4?loc=external&signature=5b5c24abc0922a7e42e3aab8b728a7d25e67c546b59b5499453d19bf37cf71aa" title="Visual Editor with data bindings" autoplay={true} loop={true}/>

    CloudCannon generates the preview of your Site during build time. As builds are disabled in Headless Mode, this editing interface is unavailable.
