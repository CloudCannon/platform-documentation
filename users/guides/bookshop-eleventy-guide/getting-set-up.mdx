Building a site with Bookshop requires a specific directory structure that lives alongside your website,
and an Eleventy plugin to discover and use components.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
   As a useful reference, the [Eleventy Bookshop Starter](https://github.com/CloudCannon/eleventy-bookshop-starter/) repository 
   contains a simple site fully integrated with visual editing. Browsing the code and the file structure
   of the starter site can be helpful to solidify the concepts covered in this guide.
</comp.Notice>

## Prerequisites

Bookshop requires Node >= 16 to be installed on your machine.

## Creating your Bookshop directory

Bookshop requires that your component files live in a specific directory structure, which allows for components
to be discovered automatically. 

The easiest way to get started is to run Bookshop's `init` command. This should be run alongside your website source files:

<comp.CodeBlock language="bash" source="Command line">
```
npx @bookshop/init --new _component-library --framework eleventy
```
</comp.CodeBlock>

After running this command, the following directory structure will be created:

<comp.Tree>
```
_component-library/
>> bookshop/
>  >> bookshop.config.cjs
>> components/
>  >> sample/
>     >> sample.bookshop.yml
>     >> sample.eleventy.liquid
>     >> sample.scss
>> shared/
   >> eleventy/
   >  >> page.eleventy.liquid
   >> styles/
      >> global.scss
```
</comp.Tree>

Here's a quick run-through of what has been generated:

<comp.DataReference>
 <comp.DataReferenceRow label="bookshop/bookshop.config.cjs" type_markdown="">
    This houses the configuration for your Bookshop project, in this case instructing Bookshop to use the `@bookshop/eleventy-engine` package for any live component rendering.
 </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="components/" type_markdown="">
    This is where you will write your component files, a sample component has been added for you.
 </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="shared/eleventy/" type_markdown="">
    Any non-component files that you want to be able to use when live editing can be placed here. A page helper has been created, which helps render arrays of components.
 </comp.DataReferenceRow>
  <comp.DataReferenceRow label="shared/styles/" type_markdown="">
    Optionally, any SCSS files in this directory will be imported alphabetically before component SCSS files. These are used on both the site, and the component browser.
 </comp.DataReferenceRow>
</comp.DataReference>

## Connecting Bookshop to Eleventy

To connect Bookshop and Eleventy, install the `@bookshop/eleventy-bookshop` plugin from npm:

<comp.Tabs label="Package Managers">
 <comp.Tab name="npm">
    <comp.CodeBlock language="bash" source="Command line">
    ```
    npm i --save-exact @bookshop/eleventy-bookshop
    ```
    </comp.CodeBlock>
 </comp.Tab>
 <comp.Tab name="Yarn">
    <comp.CodeBlock language="bash" source="Command line">
    ```
    yarn add --exact @bookshop/eleventy-bookshop
    ```
    </comp.CodeBlock>
 </comp.Tab>
</comp.Tabs>

Within your Eleventy config, import this plugin and specify the path to your Bookshop project.

<comp.CodeBlock language="javascript" source=".eleventy.js">
```
const pluginBookshop = require("@bookshop/eleventy-bookshop");

module.exports = function (eleventyConfig) {
  // ...

  eleventyConfig.addPlugin(pluginBookshop({
    bookshopLocations: ["_component-library"], /*1*/ /*2*/
    pathPrefix: '', /*3*/
  }));

  // ...
};
```
<comp.Annotation number="1">
   Make sure that `bookshopLocations` points to the component library you just created, relative to your Eleventy source.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="2">
   If you specify multiple paths, components will be merged from all sources that exist.
</comp.Annotation>
<comp.Annotation number="3">
   The `pathPrefix` provided must match the `pathPrefix` configured in your `.eleventy.js` configuration.

   If you aren't using `pathPrefix`, this option can be omitted.
</comp.Annotation>
</comp.CodeBlock>

Now that Bookshop is installed and your Eleventy site can access it, we can look at creating and using components.
