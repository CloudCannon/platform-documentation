Tenovos is an enterprise focused DAM (Digital Asset Manager).  Your enterprise account manager will work directly with Tenovos to make this connection. If you want to add this on your own, this document will show the process.

Connecting Tenovos will allow your editors to choose from your existing assets. This file picker will be available in all editing interfaces that accept assets. A Tenovos DAM is created on an Organisation and connected to each site. This allows you to choose which sites can interface with Tenovos and reduce configuration across branches.

To connect Tenovos to a site, go to the *Site Settings / Assets* of your chosen site.

Select an existing connected Tenovos DAM if you have one. Alternatively, click *New DAM* to authenticate a new Tenovos Connection.

<comp.DocsImage path="ye_olde_images/screen-shot-2022-03-02-at-9-27-18-am.png" alt={null} type="screenshot" />

Fill out all the details provided by Tenovos including your username and password.

Once completed you can complete the connection to the site. Your new Tenovos DAM will be selected in the DAM drop down. Click Link DAM to finish connecting the new DAM to your site.

This new Tenovos DAM can be connected to as many sites as you like. This is useful for different branches/environments of the same site that need to interface with the same assets.
