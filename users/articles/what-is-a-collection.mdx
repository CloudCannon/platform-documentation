A Collection is a group of related files with a similar format (e.g., a folder of pages, blog posts, or data files). Collections are a core part of your CloudCannon CMS experience.

By default, CloudCannon automatically detects your Collections when you first create your [CloudCannon configuration file](/documentation/articles/what-is-the-cloudcannon-configuration-file/) by searching your files for folders of similar content. You can [configure your Collections]() when you first create your Site or at any time by opening your CloudCannon configuration file in the [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/the-data-editor/) or [Source Editor](/documentation/articles/the-source-editor/).

In CloudCannon, your Collections appear in the *Site Navigation* for easy access. Each Collection has a name and icon. You can also [configure Collection groups in the *Site Navigation*](/documentation/articles/configure-your-site-navigation/) to organize your content further.

Clicking on a Collection will open the *Collection browser*. The *Collection browser* shows you all the files in your Collection, with each file represented by a [Card](/documentation/articles/what-are-cards/). Depending on how you have configured your Site, these file Cards will show:

* The title of your file.
* An icon.
* Some metadata associated with that file (e.g., the output URL).
* An image within the file or a preview screenshot of the webpage to which the file outputs.

This allows your team members to see all your content at a glance.

  For more information on configuring how your files look in the *Collection browser*, please read our documentation on [Cards](/documentation/articles/what-are-cards/).
</comp.Notice>

The *Sort* dropdown, the *View* dropdown, and the *Collection filter* search bar are at the top of the Collection browser. These tools allow you to customize the order in which your files appear, switch between *List*, *Card*, or *Gallery* view, and search for specific files.

By default, Collections also has an *\+ Add* button at the top right to add files and subfolders to your Collection. You can access additional file actions by opening the *Context Menu* at the top right of a file card.

From your *Collection browser*, your team members can [add files](/documentation/articles/add-a-file/), [edit files](/documentation/articles/edit-your-files/), and [delete files](/documentation/articles/delete-a-file/). Clicking on a file will open it in one of CloudCannon's four editing interfaces: the [Visual Editor](/documentation/articles/the-visual-editor/), the [Content Editor](/documentation/articles/the-content-editor/), the [Data Editor](/documentation/articles/the-data-editor/), or the [Source Editor](/documentation/articles/the-source-editor/).

As you make changes to your files, CloudCannon will help you keep track of those changes by adding a New, Edited, or Deleted *File Badge* to your file Cards. When you [save your changes](/documentation/articles/save-your-changes/), CloudCannon will update your Git repository and remove the *File Badges*.

You can configure your Collections in multiple ways to create an intuitive editing experience for your team members. This includes configuring the Collection name and icon, adding a description or documentation link, changing how new files are created, or adding a file glob or Schema.
