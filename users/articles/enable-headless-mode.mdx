<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  Headless Mode is only available for Sites using Unified Configuration. For more information, please read our [Unified Configuration migration guide](/documentation/guides/unified-configuration-migration-guide/).
</comp.Notice>

Headless Mode disables hosting and building for your Site.

To enable Headless Mode on your Site:

1. Navigate to the *Details* page under *Site Settings*.
2. Select the *Headless* option under *Mode*.
3. Click the *Update Site* button.
4. Click the *Turn off hosting and builds* button on the confirmation modal.

CloudCannon will immediately take down your live Site and prevents any further builds.

When your Site is in Headless Mode, CloudCannon will display a reduced set of pages in your *Site Settings*.

You can turn off *Headless Mode* at any time by selecting *Hosted* on the *Details* page under your *Site Settings*.
