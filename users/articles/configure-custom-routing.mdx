<comp.Notice info_type="important">
  This feature is only available for Sites [hosted through CloudCannon](/documentation/articles/what-is-web-hosting/#hosting-on-cloud-cannon). If you host your Site externally, or use CloudCannon in [Headless Mode](/documentation/articles/what-is-headless-mode/), this feature will not work.
</comp.Notice>

Custom routing allows you to control which content is delivered to your visitors when they enter a URL in their internet browser. You can create custom routing by creating a `routing.json` file in your `.cloudcannon` folder. When a visitor requests your webpage, CloudCannon will also load the `routing.json` file to extend the default routing behavior.

Your custom routing file can specify [redirects](/documentation/articles/configure-custom-routing/#custom-redirects) and [headers](/documentation/articles/configure-custom-routing/#custom-headers) using JSON data.

* **Custom redirect** — an instruction to redirect a visitor from one URL to another.
* **Custom header** — additional information passed between the web server and the client (e.g., visitor's browser).

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  Invalid JSON data in the `routing.json` file will cause your Site [builds](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-site-build/) to fail, protecting the live version of your Site. You can troubleshoot your JSON using the [build output logs](/documentation/articles/what-is-a-site-build/#reading-your-build-output-logs).
</comp.Notice>

To create a blank custom routing file:

1. Navigate to the `.cloudcannon` folder using the *File browser*, or create one in the root of your Site.
2. Click the *\+ Add* button at the top right of the browser and select the *\+ Create new file* option from the dropdown. CloudCannon will open a blank `.txt` file in the Source Editor.
3. Click the *Save* button in the top right of the editing interface. CloudCannon will open the *Review changes* modal.
4. Edit the file path to "/.cloudcannon/routing.json" and click the *Save selected* button in the bottom right of the modal.

CloudCannon will save a blank `routing.json` file in your `.cloudcannon` folder.

If you would prefer, you can also create a `routing.json` file using your local development environment.

For a complete list of options available in the `routing.json` file, please read our [routing reference](/documentation/articles/routing-reference/) documentation.

## Custom Routes

When CloudCannon loads the `routing.json` file each time a visitor requests a URL, the first matching routing rule can control what content is delivered to the visitor by redirecting them to a different URL or serving a different content without changing the URL (i.e., a proxy). You can specify the type of custom route using an [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).

CloudCannon supports the following redirect codes:

* **301** — Indicates the requested URL has been changed permanently.
* **302** — Indicates the requested URL has been changed temporarily, and the visitor's browser should continue to use the original URL in future requests.
* **307** — Indicates the requested URL has been changed temporarily and the visitor's browser should continue to use the original URL in future requests. This is similar to a 302 code however it does not allow the HTTP method to change.
* **308** — Indicates the requested URL has been changed permanently. This is similar to a 301 code however it does not allow the HTTP method to change.

CloudCannon supports the following proxy codes:

* **200** — Indicates the request was successful.
* **404** — Indicates the requested URL could not be found.
* **410** — Indicates the requested URL has been permanently deleted, and search engines should de-index this page.

When configuring custom routing, most users will only need the 307, 308, and 404 status codes.

We recommend redirecting your old page URLs with 307 or 308 redirects whenever you change the URL of a page or the architecture of your Site in a way that affects the URL structure. Redirecting old URLs will:

* Preserve your SEO scores if you want to rank highly in search engine results.
* Maintain external links to your website.
* Prevent visitors from seeing incorrect or missing content when they attempt to load any of your old URLs.

We also recommend [configuring a 404 page](/documentation/articles/configure-a-404-page/) and routing all unrecognized subpaths to that page.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  CloudCannon reads your routes in order, and will use the earliest matching rule for a given `from` URL. Duplicate rules are ignored.
</comp.Notice>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  You can redirect to, but not from a URL fragment (e.g. example.com/blog/#heading). The URL fragment is not passed to the server so, it cannot be processed by the redirect.
</comp.Notice>

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  You can use routing to load a single HTML file on multiple URL routes and use JavaScript to load different content (e.g., as a single-page app, or SPA).
</comp.Notice>

You must configure three keys for a custom redirect: the `from` URL, the `to` URL, and the `status` code.

* **From** — Specifies which URL should trigger this redirect rule.
* **To** — Specifies which URL the visitor should be redirected or proxied to.
* **Status** — Tells the visitor's browser the reason for the route using an [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).

To add custom routes to your `routing.json` file:

1. Navigate to the `.cloudcannon` folder in your *File browser* and click on the `routing.json` file. CloudCannon will open `routing.json` in the Source Editor.
2. Create a JSON array under the `routes` key. Each entry in the array could include the keys `from`, `to`, and `status`.
3. When you are happy with your routing file, save your changes.

After a successful build, CloudCannon will route visitors according to the rules in your `routing.json` file.

Here are a few examples:

<comp.CodeBlock language="json" source=".cloudcannon/routing.json">
```

{
  "routes": [
    {
      "from": "/cloudcannon/(.*)",
      "to": "https://cloudcannon.com/$1",
      "status": 302
    },
    {
      "from": "/documentation/articles/choosing-your-ssg/",
      "to": "/documentation/articles/select-your-ssg/",
      "status": 301
    },
    {
      "from": "/app/(.*)",
      "to": "/app/",
      "status": 200
    }
  ]
}

```
</comp.CodeBlock>

For more a complete list of configuration keys available for custom routing, please read our [routing reference documentation](/documentation/articles/routing-reference/).

### Generating redirects

If your Site requires it, you can generate your routing file at build time.

For example, if you only want to redirect URLs on your production Site, you could add the following Liquid templating:

<comp.CodeBlock language="JSON" source="routing.json">
``````````

{
  routes: [
    {% if environment == 'production' %}
      {from: '/example-1',
      to: '/example-2'}
    {% endif %}
  ]
}

``````````
</comp.CodeBlock>

You can create a build process to generate your routing file with the correct content, depending on the environment. In this case, the build process should generate the file to `_cloudcannon/routing.json` in your site output directory. CloudCannon will use this file instead of  `.cloudcannon/routing.json` from your source.

For more information, please contact our friendly [support team](/support/).

## Custom Headers

Custom HTTP headers allow you to pass more information between your web server and the visitor's browser every time someone loads a web page. Custom headers are often used to change some website behavior, meet security requirements, or allow other origins to load resources.

In CloudCannon, you can configure headers using the `routing.json` file. Whenever a visitor loads a web page from your Site, all relevant header rules from your routing file are applied in order.

<comp.Notice info_type="info">
  CloudCannon supports a specific set of headers. For a complete list, please read our [routing](/documentation/articles/routing-reference/) reference documentation.
</comp.Notice>

To add custom headers to your `routing.json` file:

1. Navigate to the `.cloudcannon` folder in your *File browser* and click on the `routing.json` file. CloudCannon will open `routing.json` in the Source Editor.
2. Create a JSON array under the `headers` key.
3. Within the `headers` key, add an object labeled `match` and a second `headers` array. The value of the `match` object should be a REGEX string of all URLs to which you want to add a header.
4. Within the second `headers` array, add an entry for each custom header. Each entry in the array should include the keys `name` and `value`.
5. When you are happy with your routing file, save your changes.

After a successful build, CloudCannon will load your custom headers whenever a page loads.

<comp.CodeBlock language="json" source=".cloudcannon/routing.json">
```

{
  "headers": [
    {
      "match": "*",
      "headers": [
        {
          "name": "Access-Control-Allow-Origin",
          "value": "https://example.com"
        },
        {
          "name": "X-Content-Type-Options",
          "value": "nosniff"
        },
        {
          "name": "X-Robots-Tag",
          "value": "noindex, nofollow"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```
</comp.CodeBlock>
